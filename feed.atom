        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says “millions of Brits” are saying they “cannot believe” the way they reacted to the news of the death of Queen Elizabeth II. 

“Grown men moved to tears … good, decent folk moved emotionally in a way they could never, never, have understood," Mr Farage told Sky News Australia. 

“The day after the announcement, people said to me, young and old, they just couldn’t get to sleep, they couldn’t believe what had happened  – this rock, this woman who stood for decency, honour, integrity, Christianity, service – had gone.

“It’s been a very emotional, very sad couple of days.”]]></summary>

The Ukrainian army has recaptured around 2,000 square kilometres of territory this month in areas previously occupied by Russia as part of Ukraine's counter-offensive, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
In a video speech on Saturday evening, Zelensky thanked all the soldiers who were involved in the recapturing territory in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine.
Earlier in the day, Russia's military announced a withdrawal from the region.
The Russian army made a good decision by fleeing, Zelensky asserted: "Occupiers have no place in Ukraine and will not have one."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Tower House on the Upper East Side is listed for $2.3 million, The Post has learned. 
Formerly owned by Barbara Corcoran, judge of Shark Tank and founder of the Corcoran Group, the residence worthy of a “superhero lair” is located at 205 East 69th Street. 
Laurin Sydney, former CNN host of “Showbiz Today,” and her husband, Mark Burk, are the current owners of the one-bedroom, one-bathroom duplex.
Designed as ‘a cottage in the sky’, the couple have lived in the house for 25 years, since buying it from Ms Corcoran herself in 1997. 
Billed as a “one-of-a-kind” penthouse, the co-op residence includes a wraparound 1,200 square foot rooftop terrace. 
The Tower House was once owned by Barbara Corcoran.Lifestyle Production Group for CorcoranA view of the vast terrace.

Interior features include pre-war details, a wood burning fireplace, 10 foot ceilings and original cast iron windows.  A custom steel spiral staircase leads up to the bedroom with a 360 degree view of the city.
“Perched atop the Penthouse, this two-story cottage in the sky offers four magical light displays that make you feel like you’ve left New York and stepped into a Parisian dream,” said the list of states. 
The bathroom includes an Amerec cedar sauna, a separate glass tub with a Jacuzzi and a soaking tub.  Meanwhile, bedroom features include custom closets and a hidden TV cabinet.
Building amenities include a 24-hour doorman, supermarket, fitness center, laundry room, and private storage. 
Corcoran agent Steve Gold and his colleague Scott Hernandez of the Corcoran group hold the list.

Ghost forks help developers test timing assumptions to ensure network security during rolling upgrades.  In light of the merger, Ethereum developers implemented the first shadow fork on April 11, 2022.

The testnet allowed Ethereum developers to practice running nodes, deploying contracts, and testing infrastructure, among other features.  Therefore, phantom forks allow developers to assess the implications of network upgrades before they occur.
As part of the upgrade, the community needs to update their Ethereum clients and run the combination of an execution layer and a consensus layer.

CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, Alexander Höptner, emphasized the need to pay special attention when upgrading Ethereum to avoid service interruptions. 
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Höptner explained:

“You just have to, say, be awake and see what’s going on.  There is a chance for high volatility.  And so you need to make sure your services are up and running. […] We don’t expect any major disruptions outside of volatility.  »

The CEO further stated that the success of The Merge will depend on community support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major League Baseball adopted its first field clock, limits on defensive changes and bigger bases for the upcoming season in an effort to shorten games and increase offense in a traditional sport.
The decision on time and shift restrictions by the sport’s 11-man competition committee was made on Friday due to unanimous opposition from the panel’s players, who approved the larger bases.  The changes had long been pushed by baseball commissioner Rob Manfred in an effort to combat the increase in dead time over four decades and the suffocation of offense in the age of analysis.
“Over the past few years’ extensive testing, minor league folks and a wide range of fans – from the most loyal to casual observers – have recognized the collective impact of these changes in making the game even better…]]></summary>

“There were times when we didn’t have a math teacher or we didn’t have a language teacher,” Megan Carey, principal at Terra Nova High School, located south of San Francisco, told CBS News. 
The reason?  “High cost of living — 100%!”  she said.

Now your school district is trying something new: affordable housing on school property.  It is a 122-unit apartment complex that was approved by local voters and built for faculty and staff on property in the Jefferson Union High School District.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[throughout your life,  Queen Elizabeth II  has always shown his deep involvement in maintaining close relations between the United Kingdom and the United States.
Jane Hartley, the US ambassador to the UK, told CBS Mornings that there was no closer ally to the United States than the Queen herself. 
“I think she loved America, and we loved her. When I arrived, it was just before the platinum jubilee, and I was amazed at the number of people on the street who simply adored her.  And there was a lot of respect.  But there were many, many Americans there,” Hartley said. 

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Queen ordered the Star Spangled Banner to be thrown outside Buckingham Palace as a way of showing solidarity with Americans.
Queen Elizabeth II brought together 13 US presidents in office.  She met a US president in 1951 when she traveled to the US and met then-President Harry Truman. 
Since then, she has ridden horses with then-President Ronald Reagan, watched a Baltimore baseball game with former President George HW Bush and danced with former President Gerald Ford.  
The first time President Biden met the Queen was as a US Senator in 1982.  
The last time I saw her was in Windsor Castle    last year, after the Queen welcomed him and First Lady Jill Biden for tea.
Biden and the First Lady visited the British Embassy in Washington to sign a book of condolences to the Queen.  He commented on her death at a fundraiser. 
“I had the opportunity to get to know her before she passed away and she was an incredibly decent and gracious woman, and the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth in their grief,” Biden said.  
The president said he is likely to attend his next funeral.  All flags at US federal and military installations were ordered to fly with half staff in honor of the Queen.

Noema had pushed former attorney general Jason Ravnsborg    to resign and later for his impeachment for his involvement in a fatal car accident.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, harrowing photographs of Queen Elizabeth II dominated the front pages of grieving British newspapers, charting her journey from coronation to the nation’s matriarch. 
A photo of 27-year-old Elizabeth taken at her coronation in 1953, full of regal splendor clutching the Sovereign’s Orb and Scepter within the vaulted walls of Westminster Abbey, made headlines in The Times, Guardian, Daily Star and Independent. 
The Sun, Daily Telegraph, Daily Express and Daily Mirror instead chose images of the white-haired monarch as she neared the end of her record-breaking 70-year reign. 
The Telegraph published a citation made by the Queen for the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. “Grief is the price we pay for love,” he said. 
Most tabloids marked the occasion with dim black-and-white front pages, although The Sun splashed its header in royal purple, above the headline “We Loved You Lady”.
“Rest in peace, Madame. The Sun and our readers loved you. We are proud that you were our queen,” he added. 
The Daily Express carried the headline ‘Our beloved Queen is dead’, while the Daily Mirror simply wrote ‘Thank you’.
“Our hearts are broken,” said the Daily Mail headline.  “How do we find the words? Our grief is a hundred different emotions, all difficult to grasp,” her homepage said. 
“As God Save the Queen played on radio and television, as we learned that our beloved monarch had died, a nation’s heart broke,” he added.
Unsurprisingly, the story filled the inside pages of souvenir edition newspapers, most devoting at least 20 pages to seismic events.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Italy’s Right Set for Crushing Win in Last Polls Before Vote 
(Bloomberg) -- Italy’s right-wing coalition, led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, is poised for a landslide win on Sept. 25, according to the last available polls before a blackout period. 
The bloc has an advantage of almost 20 percentage points on the center-left coalition led by Enrico Letta’s Democratic Party, according to Bloomberg’s latest polling average. 
Such an advantage, thanks to Italy’s complex electoral system, might grant it a two-thirds majority of seats in both houses of parliament, enough to change Italy’s constitution on its own. 
Support for Meloni’s Brothers of Italy has been growing steadily since she took center stage in the campaign. At 45, Meloni, who started her political career in Italy’s post-fascist party, is a political veteran but has almost no government experience. 
As the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, she has vowed to maintain the course set by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi on support for Ukraine and fiscal discipline.

(Bloomberg) -- Sweden is heading for a tight general election on Sunday, with polls showing Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson neck-and-neck with the opposition that’s looking to unseat her Social Democrats. 
The vote comes after a campaign dominated by skyrocketing electricity prices and soaring gun violence that are shaking Swedish society to the core. 
The country, long a bastion of social democracy, has seen its political landscape upended by the nationalist Sweden Democrats over the past years.  The anti-immigration party is a part of the center-right opposition bloc that is seeking four years at the helm of the biggest Nordic country, proposing to reverse a policy of gradually exiting nuclear energy and warning Andersson’s victory could result in higher taxes. 
Still, Andersson could benefit from being seen as a responsible leader in time of crisis.  The results will trickle in on Sunday night and by Monday morning it should be clear whether opposition parties will get a shot at forming a new government.

The Navy says it has more UFO videos. It doesn’t want to share them. 
The U.S. Navy says that releasing any additional UFO videos would “harm national security” and told a government transparency website that all of the government’s UFO videos are classified information. 
In a Freedom of Information Act request response, the Navy told government transparency site The Black Vault that any public dissemination of new UFO videos “will harm national security as it may provide adversaries valuable information regarding Department of Defense/Navy operations, vulnerabilities, and/or capabilities. 
No portions of the videos can be segregated for release.”

A US Air Force Osprey aircraft has been stuck at a remote nature preserve in northern Norway for almost a month, a Norwegian military official said on Thursday. 
The military tiltrotor aircraft, which has the ability to fly like a prop plane or hover like a helicopter, made a "controlled emergency landing" on August 12 at the Stongodden nature preserve on the island of Senja and has been stuck ever since, Lt. Col. Eivind Byre, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Air Force, told Insider. 
Norway's military is working with the US Air Force and local environmental protection officials to craft a plan to rescue the aircraft, Byre said.

President Biden said Friday that he plans to attend the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in London later this month — after the White House initially declined to confirm any travel plans. 
“Yes. I don’t know what the details are yet, but I’ll be going,” Biden said in Ohio when asked if he would join the service for the 96-year-old monarch, who died Thursday at her Balmoral estate in Scotland. 
Biden also told reporters that he had not yet spoken to King Charles III, who gained the throne upon the death of his mother.

Insider: Greece warns another European war could be on the horizon as Turkey hints at the possibility of an invasion 
* Greece is calling on the EU, NATO, and the UN to condemn Turkey over recent threats. 
* Turkey's Erdogan has made veiled threats of an attack against Greece. 
* "When the time comes, we can come suddenly one night," Erdogan said on Tuesday. 
Greece is calling on its allies to condemn Turkey over recent aggressive rhetoric from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has hinted at the possibility of open conflict as tensions rise between the two countries. 
In letters dated Monday and Tuesday to NATO, the EU, and the UN that were reported on by the Associated Press, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias called for all three institutions to rebuke Ankara over Erdogan's comments. 
Dendias said that allowing Turkey to continue threatening Greece would run the risk of yet another conflict in Europe, in an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine.

DW: Ukraine reconstruction may cost $349 billion 
As the war in Ukraine goes on, the cost of rebuilding the country and its economy mounts up dramatically. A detailed new report puts a figure on the damage: more than one-third of a trillion US dollars. 
The cost of rebuilding Ukraine and its economy has already reached at least $349 billion (€346 billion), according to a new report jointly compiled by the World Bank, the European Commission and the Ukrainian government. 
In the more than six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the country has suffered widespread destruction. 
"The impact of the invasion will be felt for generations, with families displaced and separated, disruptions to human development, destruction of intrinsic cultural heritage and reversal of a positive economic and poverty trajectory," the report states.

Newsweek: U.S. Preparing for Russia to Bring War to NATO Countries 
The U.S. State Department announced Thursday that it wants the U.S. lawmakers to approve funds for countries that neighbor Ukraine and "are potentially at risk of future Russian aggression." 
The funds would be part of a new $2 billion-plus aid package to Ukraine and its allies that has been proposed by U.S. officials. 
In a statement on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the funds would be provided to 18 nations that neighbor Ukraine. 
The $2.2 billion package, which would need to be approved by Congress, would provide roughly $1 billion to Ukraine, and the rest would be split among countries including the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia and Lithuania, the Associated Press reported, while Slovakia, Poland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Moldova and Slovenia would also receive funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A blackout caused by fresh shelling near Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has compromised the site's safety, the UN atomic watchdog warned Friday, adding the plant's operator is considering shutting down the sole remaining reactor.

Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday said Russia’s strategic objectives in its attack on Ukraine have “been defeated.” 
“The war is not over, but so far the Russian strategic objectives have been defeated,” Milley said at a news conference alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

Update #1: Milley’s assessment: Russia’s war in Ukraine ‘minor tactical success,’ but ‘strategic defeat’ (Washington Examiner) 
Update #2: Gen. Milley Says Russia Has Failed To Meet Strategic Objectives But War Isn't Over (Huffington Post)   
WNU editor: The video where General Milley made these remarks is above, and the transcript is here .... Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army General Mark A. Milley Hold a Press Conference Following the Ukraine Defense Contact Group Meeting, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. 
As to what is my take. I do not share General Milley's assessment. 
At the start of the war President Putin stated what was Russia's goals (link here). I see no evidence that these goals have changed, but I do see evidence that Russia has expanded its strategic objectives to include Ukrainian territories that have large Russian-Ukrainian populations. 
The narrative from the Kremlin and Russian media have also been very clear this summer. This is going to be a long war, lasting into 2023 and maybe into 2024. 
Will Russia succeed? I do not know. 
But I think it is too early for General Milley to claim Russia's strategic objectives have been defeated in Ukraine.]]></summary>

KYIV, Ukraine — Russian state television broadcast an interview Friday acknowledging that Kyiv had achieved a “substantial victory” after Ukrainian forces burst through the front line in a lightning advance. 
The Ukrainian breakthrough near Kharkiv was the fastest advance reported by either side for months, and one of the biggest shifts in the war’s momentum since Russian forces abandoned a disastrous assault on Kyiv, the capital, in March.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had “liberated dozens of settlements” and reclaimed more than 1,000 square km (385 square miles) of territory in the Kharkiv region in the east as well as Kherson in the south in the past week.

The above video from the Military Summary channel provides a good analysis on the Kharkiv front. As to what is my take. Along the entire front the Russian military is holding its own, but it is a disaster on the Kharkiv front that the Russian Ministry of Defense will need to address ASAP.]]></summary>

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's right-wing bloc is on track to win a clear majority in both houses of parliament at this month's election, according to studies based on the final opinion polls before a ban on their publication kicks in on Saturday.
The far-right Brothers of Italy which dominates the conservative alliance is set to be the largest single party at the Sept. 25 vote, according to the latest surveys which show it widening its lead over the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).
A study by the Cattaneo Institute think tank, based on polls conducted up to Aug. 31, suggests the conservative bloc could elect at least 258 lawmakers out of 400 in the Chamber of Deputies, and 131 out of 200 in the Senate.
It estimated a 91.5% probability that the alliance, in which Giorgia Meloni'…]]></summary>

* A new law says North Korea can carry out a preventive nuclear strike 'automatically' and 'immediately to destroy the hostile forces' 
* Announcement comes at a time of heightened tensions with South Korea 
* Pyongyang blames Seoul for the outbreak of Covid-19 in its territory and has worryingly conducted a record number of weapons tests this year 
Kim Jong Un had declared he is ready to launch preventive nuclear strikes in a new law passed this week, state media said on Friday. 
Such 'preventative' strikes could be made even in the face of conventional attacks against the isolated country, the law states. 
The move effectively eliminates the possibility of denuclearisation talks, with the dictator saying the country's status as a nuclear state was now 'irreversible'.

Mourners stood silently and watched, while some placed bouquets in the black railings of the landmark residence.
"We just wanted to pay tribute to the queen," said Natalie Vehring, a violinist who has performed at concerts attended by the queen.
She was at the palace with her husband and two sons in school uniform, while on a video call with her mother in Australia.

* “The German economy is facing a difficult time ahead of us due to the Ukraine conflict, China, supply chain problems and the energy crisis,” Commerzbank CEO Manfred Knof told CNBC on Thursday. 
* “Probably the German economy is going into a downward [trajectory] and maybe into a recession but the good news is there no reason to panic,” he added. 
* Fears of a recession have been exacerbated amid the possibility of a winter gas shortage in Europe. 
The chief executive of one of Germany’s biggest banks, Commerzbank, sought to reassure investors Thursday about the prospect of non-performing loans this winter, saying banks are far better placed to cope compared to previous crises. 
“The German economy is facing a difficult time ahead of us due to the Ukraine conflict, China, supply chain problems and the energy crisis,” Commerzbank CEO Manfred Knof told CNBC’s Annette Weisbach at a Handelsblatt conference in Frankfurt, Germany.

She was estimated to be worth £370 million (more than $420 million) -- not quite enough to earn her a spot on The Sunday Times' 2022 "Rich List" of the UK's 250 wealthiest. And her fortune was dwarfed by that of other monarchs: the Thai royal family's wealth is estimated at between $50 and $70 billion, while Saudi King Salman has a reported net worth of $18 billion. So how did she make her money and how did she spend it?

The announcement comes at a time of crumbling ties between the North and South, with Pyongyang blaming Seoul for the outbreak of Covid-19 in its territory and conducting a record number of weapons tests this year.
The law will allow North Korea to carry out a preventive nuclear strike "automatically" and "immediately to destroy hostile forces," when a foreign country poses an imminent threat to Pyongyang, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
With the newly enacted law, "the status of our country as a nuclear weapons state has become irreversible," leader Kim Jong Un said, according to KCNA.

Bloomberg: German Anger Spills Over as Countries Balk at Gas-Sharing Deals 
(Bloomberg) -- Hope is dimming in Germany that it will be able clinch more gas solidarity agreements with European Union partners beyond the ones already in place with Denmark and Austria, a potential further hindrance to Berlin’s ability to mitigate the effects of the energy crisis. 
Germany’s neighbors Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Poland refuse to engage in “constructive negotiations” about such bilateral deals, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in a report to lawmakers seen by Bloomberg. 
That could exacerbate the gas crunch in Germany “because a substantial building bloc of the EU’s gas crisis resilience in the form of bilateral agreements would not be available,” Habeck said in the paper, which he presented to the Bundestag’s energy and climate committee late Wednesday in Berlin.

The island's southern coast has an unusually high density of blue whales, classed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and is one of the world's busiest international shipping lanes.
Campaigners believe more than a dozen of the gigantic animals -- the largest ever to have lived on Earth at up to 30 meters long and 150 tonnes -- have been killed in collisions with commercial ships in the last decade.
There have also been occasional reports of fishermen dying when their boats were run down by container ships in the area, a rich fishing ground.

It's a game many children have been playing throughout the summer on roads throughout the war-torn Donbas and Kharkiv regions.

NEW DELHI — Indian and Chinese troops are pulling back from one of the several disputed border areas in the Himalayan mountains where they have been locked in a standoff for over two years. 
The Indian Defense Ministry said in a statement Thursday evening that troops had begun to disengage from the area of Gogra-Hotsprings “in a coordinated and planned way, which is conducive to peace and tranquility in the border areas.” 
The announcement marks a step forward in resolving a military standoff that began after a June 2020 clash in Ladakh in the western Himalayas killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.

But their discussion reflected a sea change in social attitudes: They were considering joining the military.

Its defense ministry says a stable Taiwan situation is critical for Japan's Security. 
Japan plans to beef up defenses on its remote islands in the East China Sea in preparation for a Taiwan Strait crisis, a move reflecting official strategic thinking but one likely to annoy China. 
The Japanese defense ministry wants to expand fuel and ammunition storage facilities on the Nansei (Ryukyu) island chain, the westernmost tip of which lies just 110 kilometers (68 miles) from Taiwan, Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada was quoted as saying by Nikkei Asia on Tuesday.

"It's almost like a generational challenge. 

"Can we actually have someone who replicates what a Queen really does … symbolising continuity, stability in such challenging, ever-changing, fast-changing, disconcerting times that people really … look for."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: German Diplomat Who Mocked Trump At UN Suddenly Silent As President's 'Russian Energy' Warning Comes True 
One of the German diplomats who snickered when then-President Donald Trump said Germany would “become totally dependent on Russian energy” didn’t respond to a question on whether his views have changed as rising energy costs amidst the war in Ukraine seem to prove Trump right. 
Trump made the remarks during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in Sept. 2018. Trump said during the same speech: “Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation.”   
Read more ....   
WNU editor: The whole German delegation was launging at Trump, but it was Heiko Maas, was then serving as the country’s foreign minister under then-prime minister Angela Merkel, who led the laughter. He later told reporters that Trump’s claim regarding the pipeline “does not correspond to reality,” saying that “Germany is not dependent on Russia, especially not on energy issues.”
So where is Heiko Maas right now? 
Not surprising. He is still in the government as a member of the Bundestag.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Energy bills will be frozen at £2,500 for TWO YEARS: Liz Truss unveils 'extraordinary' £150bn plan to counter Putin and subsidise household costs while businesses get 'equivalent' support for six months - as she backs fracking and using North Sea reserves 
* Liz Truss is set to ease the pain of energy bills for households by freezing them at a typical level of £2,500 
* New PM insisted that failing to take action on the scale of the Covid response would damage the economy 
* But Ms Truss also warned that major changes are needed to shore up Britain's long-term energy supplies 
Liz Truss rolled the dice on her premiership today unveiling a £150billion plan to freeze energy bills for two years and counter Vladimir Putin's blackmail. 
Admitting her action is 'extraordinary', the PM told MPs the government is committed to keeping costs for households at £2,500 a year until October 2024 - less than half the level many feared they would hit. 
Including a £400 handout most people should see little change from existing bills this year.

WNU Editor: This is not going to solve the UK's energy crisis. And who wants to invest or be in the energy business if you are forced to sell your product below your costs? My guess is that the UK government is going to bail out the utilities to keep this "House of Cards" from collapsing. And as for the future in UK ....  expect more inflation and the energy crisis continuing.

European Central Bank sets aside recession fears to increase rates by 0.75 of a percentage point to 1.25%

A future “climate king” takes over at an uncertain time for the United Kingdom and the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Biden national security advisor Jake Sullivan warns China invading Taiwan is still a 'distinct threat' - as yet ANOTHER delegation of US lawmakers visits Taipei 
* White House national security advisor told Bloomberg TV that there were no current plans for President Biden and President Xi to meet at the G20 summit 
* Sullivan accused China of being inconsistent in its position on Taiwan 
* 'The American position has remained steadfast and consistent,' he said 
* Meanwhile a bipartisan delegation of members of the House of Representatives is arrived in Taiwan Wednesday and is leaving on Friday 
* That group is being led by Florida Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy 
The possibility of China invading Taiwan continues to be a 'distinct threat' to the global order, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday. 
His warning comes just a day after a top Beijing official issued a blunt warning discouraging 'stubborn' calls for the island's independence. 
 Sullivan told Bloomberg TV that the United States would 'push back' against any efforts to topple the existing world order while also reaffirming the nation's longstanding support for the One China Policy.

Times of Israel: Nuclear deal with Iran off the table for time being, US has indicated to Israel  
Message conveyed to PM Lapid in recent conversations with Biden and other US officials; Iranian demands to halt IAEA probes appear to have derailed talks 
A new nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is off the table and will not be signed in the foreseeable future, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister site Zman Yisrael has learned. 
This is the message that was conveyed to Prime Minister Yair Lapid in his recent conversations with US President Joe Biden and other administration officials. 
This emerging outcome of the nuclear negotiations, which would have major international implications, is likely to be touted by Lapid in the coming election campaign, particularly against opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly attacked the premier on the issue.
