WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China will deepen its cooperation with Russia to try to challenge the United States despite international condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine, the leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies said on Wednesday. 
"Despite global backlash over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China will maintain its diplomatic, defense, economic, and technology cooperation with Russia to continue trying to challenge the United States, even as it will limit public support," they said in a threat assessment released as the Senate Intelligence Committee held its annual hearing on worldwide threats to U.S. security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A landlord in Canada changed the locks on a home and took votes from its occupants on whether one of the tenants could return, the Daily Hive reported. 
Man-Ling Weng claimed Daichi Araki owed him $4,500 in damages, which Araki disagreed with. 
Details from a British Columbia small claims case at the Civil Resolution Tribunal say Weng became a tenant at the home in 2019 but took over rent-collecting duties in 2020 as well as other responsibilities. Araki and Weng had an unwritten agreement where Weng payed Araki $600 on a month-to-month basis. 
On September 21, 2021, Araki allowed Weng’s friend, identified in the Hive's report as "SJC," to stay in her rented bedroom. Weng then increased her rent payments from $600 to $700. Weng then took a trip to Taiwan, and SJC then signed a document post-dated May 24, allowing SJS to stay in Weng’s room to “safeguard her possessions.”

When Weng's return date was pushed back to 4 months later, Araki gave Weng until May 31 to move out -- even though Araki didn't initially signal any objections to the extended return date. 
Araki said Weng had “breached their contract by subleasing her room to SJC without his consent.” The court said that this contradicted Araki’s statement allowing SJC to move in.
"In the end, Araki was ordered to pay $40 to Weng for a partial rent refund and $130 in damages for $170," the Hive's report stated.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-08T19:35:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed former President Donald Trump on Monday and, apparently, omitted crucial chunks of their conversation about Ukraine when it was broadcast to Hannity's radio audience.
Justin Baragona, the senior media reporter at The Daily Beast, noticed the discrepancy on Tuesday.
"According to Trump, all he needed to do was let Russia 'take over' parts of Ukraine," Baragona explained. "Saying that Russia was going for the 'whole enchilada' with Joe Biden as president, Trump added that Russia 'took over nothing' while he was in the White House because Russian President Vladimir Putin 'understood' that 'he would have never done it.'"
Trump added, "that's without even negotiating a deal. I could have negotiated. At worst, I could've made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could've worked a deal."
But as Baragona pointed out, that is not what Hannity played.
"Instead, shortly after Trump says, 'I could have negotiated,' the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that 'China no longer respects the United States,'" Baragona observed.
Baragona also noted that "besides asserting that he would have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine by making a deal to let them 'take over something,' Trump also said in the portion not aired by Fox that 'so many more people are dying than is being reported' while reiterating this 'would have never happened' under his watch."]]></summary>

"It's a treat dipped in blood," said vendor Mohammed Salha, 31, showing off truffles he spent a week collecting near his village in the central province of Hama.
"Every day I leave my house not knowing whether I will come back to my wife and daughter," he said, a brown keffiyeh scarf wrapped around his head.
"We risk our lives... but we don't care anymore, we want to feed our children," he told AFP, dark circles lining his weary eyes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A train crash in Egypt killed four people and injured more than 20, officials said Wednesday about the latest in a series of deadly accidents blamed on aging infrastructure and mismanagement.
The train overshot the station and ran into the buffers at the end of the track after passing through a stop signal, in the Nile Delta city of Qalyub north of Cairo, the National Railways Authority said.

Pictures from the scene showed emergency crews overnight using a crane to lift the derailed coach that appeared to be partially crumpled.

About 20 women held a rare demonstration in a Kabul street on Wednesday, calling on the international community to protect Afghans, AFP journalists witnessed.

To mark International Women's Day, capitals across the world are hosting marches, rallies and demonstrations, including Madrid, where broad tree-lined boulevards are regularly packed with a sea of purple, a color often associated with women's rights.
Marches took place on Wednesday in Thailand and Indonesia, where a few dozen women gathered in front of the country's parliament to urge lawmakers to pass a long-awaited bill to protect domestic workers and some chanted "long live Indonesian women".

 DNYUZ/Foreign Policy: China Is Practicing How to Sever Taiwan’s Internet 
As the United States was watching the skies in the aftermath of the spy balloon incident, China may have been acting at sea. In early February, maritime vessels disabled the two undersea cables connecting Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, a tiny archipelago just 10 nautical miles off China’s coast, to the internet. Now residents of the islands face highly reduced internet connectivity until the cables are repaired. The activity looks like targeted harassment by Beijing—or an exercise in preparation for cutting off the whole of Taiwan. 
On Feb. 2, a Chinese fishing vessel sailing close to the Matsu Islands severed one of the two cables, which connect the islands with Taiwan proper. Then, six days later, a Chinese freighter cut the second cable. Speaking shortly after the second cable was cut, Wong Po-tsung, the vice chair of Taiwan’s National Communications Commission, told reporters that there was no indication the incidents were intentional. It’s not uncommon for undersea cables to be damaged—but losing two in a row is either really unfortunate or quite possibly not a coincidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boat workers, bus drivers, doctors, teachers and Greek's entire public service sector brought the country to a near halt on Wednesday as strikes erupted in response to a train accident that killed 57.

The action particularly affected big cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki where traffic was chaotic, ferries remained in their docks and many islands were cut off from the mainland.
The country's major trade unions had called for the strike criticizing the government's privatization policy for last week's serious train accident and demanding a full investigation.
The deadly crash came after a passenger train ran onto a track on which a cargo train was approaching because of a wrong switch position.
The investigation into the accident has already revealed numerous serious mistakes within the state-owned railway company OSE. Critics have said that over the past two decades all governments had criminally neglected the Greek railways.
Ferries are moored in the port of Piraeus during a 24-hour strike. The umbrella organizations of Greek trade unions have called for nationwide strikes in protest at the collision of a passenger train with a freight train in northern Greece that killed 57 people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The White House on Tuesday denounced the kidnapping of four US citizens in Mexico, two of whom have been found dead, as "unacceptable," and said Washington would pursue justice for the victims.
"We're going to work closely with the Mexican government to ensure that justice is done in this case," White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
The four Americans crossed into Matamoros in northern Mexico, just opposite the US city of Brownsville, Texas, on Friday, according to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
They were fired upon by unidentified gunmen and taken hostage. Two were later found dead; of the other two, one is injured, according to Mexican authorities.
Kirby said the US was still learning about details of the incident from Mexican officials.
"Right now our focus is very squarely on these four Americans and the families that have been affected by the attack," he said.
"We don't have these four Americans back on home soil. And really that's what our focus is right now," he said.]]></summary>

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yielded to pressure over allegations China interfered in Canada’s elections, appointing a special investigator to study the matter. 
“Upholding confidence in our democratic process in our elections, in our institutions, is of utmost importance,” the prime minister told reporters Monday evening in Ottawa. 
The “independent special rapporteur” will have a wide mandate and make recommendations on fighting foreign meddling, he added. 
The issue will also be studied by a group of lawmakers cleared to see top-secret intelligence, Trudeau said.

WNU Editor: This is my take also .... Trudeau goes from standstill to 'panic mode' on Chinese interference (Don Martin, CTV News). According to all polls three-quarters of Canadians want answers, including this blogger who is also a Canadian.    
Update: All of this news first started from an intelligence leak. Not surprising, the Trudeau government, deeply embarrassed by all of these revelations, want to know who the leaker is .... RCMP investigating leaks alleging foreign election interference (CTV News).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British architect and urban planner David Chipperfield won the 2023 Pritzker Prize, the profession's most prestigious award, organizers announced Tuesday.
The 69-year-old was honored for "timeless modern design that confronts climate urgencies, transforms social relationships and reinvigorates cities," they said in a statement.
Chipperfield said he was "so overwhelmed" to become the prize's 52nd laureate.
"I take this award as an encouragement to continue to direct my attention not only to the substance of architecture and its meaning but also to the contribution that we can make as architects to address the existential challenges of climate change and societal inequality," the statement quoted him as saying.
Chipperfield is renowned for renovations and reconstructions of old buildings, updating them for the modern age while honoring their history and culture.
Some of his best known works include the Museo Jumex in Mexico City, a renovation of the Neues Museum in Berlin, and a new building for the Saint Louis Art Museum in Missouri.
"We know that, as architects, we can have a more prominent and engaged role in creating not only a more beautiful world but a fairer and more sustainable one too," said Chipperfield.
"We must rise to this challenge and help inspire the next generation to embrace this responsibility with vision and courage," he added.
Other major works of Chipperfield's include the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany and the Des Moines Public Library in Iowa.
"He is assured without hubris, consistently avoiding trendiness to confront and sustain the connections between tradition and innovation, serving history and humanity," said Tom Pritzker, Chairman of the Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rescuers on a remote Indonesian island were searching Tuesday for dozens still missing after a landslide that killed 15 people, a disaster official said.
Poor weather and downed communication lines have complicated rescue efforts on the far-flung island of Serasan, in the Natuna region between Borneo and peninsular Malaysia, home to about 8,000 people.
Pictures provided by Natuna's communication and information agency showed houses reduced to rubble, with fallen trees and torn roofs visible.
Body bags were lined up on top of a blue tarpaulin as officials gathered to pray for the victims.
Abdul Muhari, spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), told local broadcaster Metro TV that rescuers had recovered 10 bodies at the scene, while villagers put the death toll at 15.

In a few weeks' time, as part of a conservation project, they will leave their small shed in the northeastern English port of Whitby for the open sea.
Whitby, whose dramatic abbey ruins were an inspiration for "Dracula" author Bram Stoker, is Europe's third-largest lobster port.
Some 100,000 lobsters are landed each year, providing jobs for 150 people. Joe Redfern, who runs the Whitby Lobster Hatchery, hopes eventually to release the same number each year from his tanks.
"We want to make sure that the marine environment is protected and the lobster populations are conserved for the future," the 31-year-old biology graduate told AFP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once a rare sight in the Vatican's halls of power, women are increasingly being seen in senior posts under Pope Francis, but the gender battle is far from won.
The centuries-old institution has an inherently patriarchal image, from the Swiss Guards at the gates to the cardinals seated in St Peter's Square.
It reflects the wider Roman Catholic Church, which outlaws divorce, abortion and the ordination of women.
Yet the pontiff's push for reform has seen more women given roles in administrating the Vatican -- even if they are mainly behind the scenes.
From economists to secretaries, historians and archivists, 649 women worked in 2019 for the Roman Curia -- 24 percent of employees -- compared to 385 in 2010, according to the latest available figures.

The shallow quake struck at about 2:00 pm (0600 GMT), a few kilometers from Maragusan municipality in the mountainous gold-mining province of Davao de Oro on Mindanao island.
Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more harm than deeper ones, but local authorities said there were no reports of major damage.
Cherrylyn Dapiton of the Maragusan disaster office confirmed there had been a landslide near a road, but it had not affected anyone or blocked traffic.
Photos on the local government's Facebook page showed patients on beds or in wheelchairs outside a hospital after they were evacuated from the facility.
The quake lasted about 30 seconds…]]></summary>

China’s new Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned Tuesday that “conflict and confrontation” with the United States is inevitable if Washington does not change course, delivering a stern and wide-ranging rebuke of US policies for his first press conference in the new role. 
Qin, who was until recently China’s ambassador to the US, built up a reputation for being careful and accomplished diplomat while overseas. 
But he struck a far more combative tone in his first appearance as foreign minister at China’s annual parliamentary meeting, warning of the “catastrophic consequences” of what he described as a “reckless gamble” by Washington in how it treats its fellow superpower.

Reuters: US House Speaker McCarthy plans to meet Taiwan's president in the US -sources 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy plans to meet Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in the U.S. in coming weeks, two sources told Reuters on Monday, a move that could replace the Republican Speaker's anticipated but sensitive trip to the democratically governed island claimed by China. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tsai had been invited to speak at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library during a transit through California on a planned visit to Central America, and that McCarthy was likely to meet her in the United States. 
One of the sources said should the U.S. meeting go forward - likely in April - it did not necessarily rule out McCarthy visiting Taiwan in the future.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin‘s war in Ukraine continues to rage, United States commanders and military observers are sounding the alarm about the activity of Russia’s submarine fleet thousands of miles away, off the U.S. coast. 
Throughout the war, which began when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine last February, there has been a buildup of Russian Navy forces in the Black Sea. 
There has also been an increasing presence of Russian submarines off of U.S. coasts and in the Mediterranean, according to officials.

Tsai plans to meet McCarthy in the United States in coming weeks, two sources told Reuters on Monday, a move that could replace the Republican speaker's anticipated but sensitive trip to the democratically governed island claimed by China.
China staged war games around Taiwan last August after a visit to Taipei by then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Speaking to reporters in parliament, Taiwan Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said he was not aware of a planned meeting between Tsai and McCarthy.

   Warzone/The Drive: Rolls-Royce Offers Peek At The B-52’s New Engines Undergoing Testing  
The B-52 re-engining saga goes back many decades, but it’s finally happening in the form of Rolls-Royce’s TF130 turbofan. 
  Now that testing has begun, Rolls-Royce has provided first looks at the F130 turbofan engines in their dual-pod configuration that will replace the outdated TF33 engines currently equipping the U.S. Air Force’s B-52H Stratofortress fleet. Rolls-Royce has offered this imagery as part of an update on the years-long effort to re-engine and modernize the service’s bombers. 
In fact, the fight to get the B-52 new engines is a saga that dates back decades.  A Rolls-Royce press release explains that testing of the F130 engines under the Air Force’s B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP) is being carried out at the company’s outdoor test facility at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The current round of testing will focus primarily on both crosswind aerodynamic flow and confirming that the engine’s digital controls system can operate as intended.

Defense News: Lockheed Martin resumes F-35 flights with engine vibration fix in hand 
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin on Monday morning resumed conducting acceptance flights of newly built F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, nearly three months after an engine problem grounded new jets and halted deliveries.
Lockheed announced Monday that the first flight took off from Fort Worth, Texas, where it builds the majority of F-35 fighters. 
“We resumed F-35 production flight operations today following an F135 engine mitigation action,” Lockheed Martin said in its statement.  Lockheed stopped acceptance flights after a Dec. 15 mishap involving an F-35B fighter that was undergoing a quality check flight. 
A video showed the fighter bouncing on the ground, tipping forward and spinning before the pilot safely ejected. 
The investigation that ensued found signs of a problem with the fighter’s Pratt & Whitney-made F135 engine, and engine deliveries were halted in late December. Further investigation found the engine had vibration issues.

   Business Insider: 'I can't get my money out': Billionaire investor Mark Mobius says China is restricting flows of capital out of the country 
* Emerging markets investing veteran Mark Mobius says China is restricting capital outflows. 
* He told Fox Business' "Mornings with Maria' that he couldn't pull investment funds from his account in Shanghai.
* Mobius said he's been unable to get an explanation about the "crazy" restriction. 
Mark Mobius, a pioneer in emerging markets investing, said China is restricting investment outflows from the country, a move that would be taking place as the world's second-largest economy is trying to shake off pressure from COVID-19 lockdowns. 
"I'm personally affected because I have an account with HSBC in Shanghai. I can't get my money out. 
The government is restricting the flow of money out of the country," Mobius said on Thursday on the Fox Business show "Mornings with Maria". 
"So I would be very, very careful investing in China," the founder of Mobius Capital Partners said.

* Half of Americans say China is the United States’ greatest enemy 
* Since the pandemic, China has held the top spot as the greatest enemy 
* Democrats and Republicans have different views on who is the top enemy 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- For the third year in a row, Americans are most likely to mention China as the United States’ greatest enemy in the world today. When asked the open-ended question, 50% of Americans say China is their nation’s greatest enemy, with most of the rest, 32%, naming Russia. North Korea, which was viewed as the greatest enemy in 2018, is now a distant third at 7%. 
The latest results are from Gallup’s Feb. 1-23 World Affairs survey, coinciding with widespread reporting of China’s balloon-carried surveillance device being shot down over U.S. waters. There has also been growing concern in the U.S. about China’s alleged backing of Russia in the Ukraine conflict and its association with the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The US citizens crossed into Matamoros, in Tamaulipas state, on Friday in a white minivan with North Carolina license plates, the FBI said in a statement released by the US embassy in Mexico.
"Shortly after crossing into Mexico, unidentified gunmen fired upon the passengers in the (minivan). All four Americans were placed in a vehicle and taken from the scene by armed men," the FBI said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican authorities found 103 unaccompanied minors mostly from Guatemala inside an abandoned truck trailer in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, the government said on Monday, in one of the biggest recent discoveries of migrant children traveling through Mexico.
In addition to the 103 children, authorities found 212 adults from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Ecuador in the trailer, the National Migration Institute (INM) said in a statement. Another 28 migrants traveling as families from Guatemala and El Salvador were also in the trailer, bringing the total number of passengers to 343.
Authorities discovered the trailer on a highway without a driver, INM said. It was outfitted with fans, a partially ventilated roof and a structure that created a second level inside the trailer.
A photo that INM distributed showed plastic bottles and other trash strewn across the floor of the long, narrow compartment.
The children will be put into custody of Veracruz's family services system while the other migrants will be processed to determine their legal status in Mexico, INM said.
Earlier this year, Mexican authorities found 57 unaccompanied minors from Guatemala at a checkpoint near the U.S.-Mexico border, and 20 other unaccompanied minors in a group of mostly Central Americans in the southern state of Chiapas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archaeologists in Egypt have unearthed a sphinx statue "with a smiley face and two dimples" near the Hathor Temple, one of the country's best preserved ancient sites, the tourism and antiquities ministry announced Monday.
It is the latest in a series of discoveries revealed over the past few months.
The limestone artefact, believed to be a stylised representation of an ancient Roman emperor, was found inside a two-level tomb near the temple in southern Egypt, the ministry said in a statement.
Next to the "beautifully and accurately carved" sphinx, researchers had found "a Roman stele written in demotic and hieroglyphic" scripts, the ministry's statement said.
Once fully deciphered, the stele may shed light on the identity of the sculpted ruler, who the Egyptian research team said could be Emperor Claudius.
Hathor Temple, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of the capital Cairo, was home to the Dendera Zodiac, a celestial map which has been displayed at the Louvre in Paris since 1922, more than a century after Frenchman Sebastien Louis Saulnier had blasted it out of the temple.
Egypt wants it back.
The country has unveiled major archaeological discoveries in recent months, primarily in the Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo but also in Giza, home of the only surviving structure of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
On Thursday, the antiquities ministry announced the discovery of a hidden nine-meter passage inside the Great Pyramid of Giza, which archaeologist Zahi Hawass said may lead to "the actual burial chamber" of pharaoh Khufu, or Cheops.
Further south, in Luxor, archaeologists had discovered an 1,800-year-old "complete residential city from the Roman era", authorities announced in January.
Some experts see such announcements as having more political and economic weight, than scientific, as Egypt is counting on tourism to revive its vital tourism industry amid a severe economic crisis.
The government aims to draw in 30 million tourists a year by 2028, up from 13 million before the pandemic.

VOA/AFP: Syria Condemns US Top General's Visit to Kurdish-Held Northeast  
Damascus, Syria — Syria's foreign ministry Sunday condemned a surprise visit by the United States' top military officer to an army base in the Kurdish-held northeast, dubbing it "illegal," state media said. 
In his snap visit Saturday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley met U.S. troops stationed in areas of war-torn Syria under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 
About 900 U.S. troops are deployed in several bases and posts across northeastern Syria as part of the fight against Islamic State group remnants. 
The official news agency SANA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying, "Syria strongly condemns the illegal visit of the American chairman of the chiefs of staff to an illegal American military base in northeast Syria."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Romana Didulo, the conspiracy theorist leader known popularly as the "QAnon Queen," is now printing her own currency for followers to use -- after they sent her their actual money to make it happen.
Vice News reports that Didulo recently thanked her followers for donating their money to her so she could fund the creation of her own "loyalty money" currency.
Vice notes that the bills she has printed so far look rather cheap, but she has nonetheless promised followers that they contain "interdimensional security devices" to assure their authenticity.

With workers across multiple sectors expected to strike, life in France could grind to a halt for days on end.    Teachers, gas and electricity workers, train drivers, and industrial workers are all expected to join strikes that begin on Tuesday, sparking national upheaval that could last for days on end. 
March 7 will mark the sixth day of industrial action since January over government plans to reform pension rights in France and increase the retirement age from 62 to 64.

CSM: US-China conundrum: Can hotline diplomacy work if trust isn’t a goal? 
Shortly after the U.S. Air Force shot down a Chinese balloon that had traversed the continental United States for several days last month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin placed a call to his counterpart in Beijing. 
At his disposal: a special hotline intended to help the two increasingly competitive global powers to prevent sudden tensions from deteriorating into full-blown crises. 
The call went unanswered. 
The Pentagon later lamented the lost opportunity for the two sides to talk out the balloon flare-up before it devolved, as it soon did, into a diplomatic imbroglio.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed.

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.
