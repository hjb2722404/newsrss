        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indonesian police said on Sunday that 127 people had died and 180 were injured after a stampede following crowd trouble at a football match in the province of East Java overnight.
After the match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya had ended, supporters from the losing team had invaded the pitch and police had fired tear gas, triggering a stampede and cases of suffocation, East Java police chief Nico Afinta told reporters.
Video footage from local news channels showed people rushing onto the pitch in the stadium in Malang and images of body bags.
The Indonesian top league BRI Liga 1 has suspended games for a week following the match that Persebaya won 3-2 and an investigation had been launched, the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) said.
There have been previous outbreaks of trouble at matches in Indonesia, with a strong rivalry between clubs sometimes leading to violence among supporters.

The sun is a little lower in the sky every day; people are wearing their quilted Carhartts and fleece Patagonias, and lined boots can't be far away.

Everyone is still going maskless inside and out. It's been this way all summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 24-hour walkout by railway staff in Britain on Saturday was set to create severe disruption as strikes resumed following the mourning period for Queen Elizabeth II.
Members of four trade unions kicked off the action after workers halted work stoppages following the death of the queen on September 8.
It is the latest industrial action by rail workers demanding wage increases to keep pace with decades-high inflation amid a cost-of-living crisis.
Tens of thousands of staff in various industries — from the postal and legal systems to ports and telecommunications — have also gone on strike across Britain since the summer.
Workers at Britain's largest container port, Felixstowe in eastern England, are currently conducting a second eight-day walkout over pay and conditions that is only set to end on Wednesday.
But it is the rail sector that has been spearheading the industrial unrest, carrying out its biggest stoppages in decades.
The latest had been planned for the week after the queen's death, but was then postponed. Many rail workers are also set to strike again on Wednesday, and on other potential dates later in the month.
This weekend's walkout coincides with preparations for Sunday's London Marathon, leaving participants struggling to reach the capital, as well as the ruling Conservatives' annual conference in Birmingham also starting Sunday.
Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, apologized to people impacted but blamed the government.
"The government has brought this dispute on," he told the BBC, as he joined other striking staff on picket lines across the country.
"They (put) the challenges down to us, to cut our jobs, to cut our pensions and to cut our wages against inflation."
But Tim Shoveller of Network Rail, which owns and manages Britain's railway infrastructure, described the strikes as a "huge own goal" leading to "less money to spend improving the railway".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons if Russia's "territorial integrity" or existence is threatened.


		Should such an escalation materialize, it would probably be in the form of a smaller tactical nuclear weapon, likely launched on a short-range Iskander ballistic missile, according to experts.


Where are the bombs?


		A 2017 report by the institute maps out 47 nuclear storage sites across Russia -- 12 national-level facilities and 35 base facilities.


		They can even be watched closely by commercial satellites, as shown by the widespread, regularly updated imagery of activities at North Korean nuclear facilities.


		But its non-strategic or tactical nuclear weapons, which number as many as 2,000, are stored and not installed on delivery vehicles like the Iskander, according to Podvig.


How would we know?


		"The weapons need to come out of storage, the units involved need to be alerted, and the Russians might also alert their strategic nuclear forces," Cancian, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told AFP.


		"All of this would be visible," he noted.


		"We can be quite certain that there are no hidden facilities," he said.


		"Technically you could probably smuggle a couple of bombs out of a storage sight undetected," he said.


		"The Russians will never be certain that it is undetected. That would be a gamble," said Podvig.


		"It would be the kind of escalatory step (and) Russia would want that to be visible," Podvig said.

Warning the world

		The United States warned for weeks before the February 24 invasion that Russia intended to attack Ukraine, seeking to prepare Kyiv and allies -- and possibly deter Moscow from acting.


		Such alarm could go global if people expected an escalation to transcontinental nuclear war.


		But Washington would likely see issuing public warnings as useful in adding to pressure on Russia, according to Podvig.


		"That message might have deterrence value."]]></summary>

I also have no information on what will be said. 
My friend thinks it will be an acceptance of Ukraine's application to quickly join NATO. 
I doubt it. 
But if it happens a joint statement from the heads of NATO and the UN on a Friday evening is unprecedented. And if it is support of Ukraine's fast track application to join NATO, war tensions are going to escalate.

I am about to give a presentation to a business group on the current geopolitical situation in the world, and what I see trending in 2023. I will not be in front of a computer until later this evening. 
If this joint statement does come out later today, I will (of course) post and analyze it. If this is all a false alarm. I will be relieved, and will sleep easier tonight.]]></summary>

KYIV (Reuters) -President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced a surprise bid for fast-track membership of the NATO military alliance on Friday and ruled out talks with President Vladimir Putin, striking back at Moscow after it said it had annexed four Ukrainian regions. 
Zelenskiy signed the NATO application papers in an online video clearly intended as a forceful rebuttal to the Kremlin after Putin held a ceremony in Moscow to proclaim the four partially occupied regions as annexed Russian land. 
"We are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to NATO," Zelenskiy said in the video on the Telegram app.

Morgan Stanley’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson said that he’s convinced a corporate earnings recession is coming—and that it could be worse than a “normal” recession. 
Wilson said in a Sept. 26 interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that his team at Morgan Stanley is looking closely at the U.S. business earnings story and the impact of corporate profits on equities, which have been on a wild ride in recent months. 
“We think it’s unavoidable … to avoid an earnings recession and that’s what matters for stocks,” Wilson said, with his remarks coming on the same day that the so-called Wall Street fear gauge soared to its highest level since mid-June when U.S. equities last hit a bear market bottom.

The EU executive proposed on Wednesday fresh sanctions against Russia, including tighter trade restrictions, more individual blacklistings and an oil price cap for third countries. 
The proposed sanctions fall short of harder-hitting measures, including a ban on importing Russian diamonds, sought by Russia hawks Poland and the three Baltic countries.

The US urged energy infrastructure operators, including LNG carriers heading for Europe, to be on high alert after suspected sabotage hit gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany.
“Everybody should be on high alert,” US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Wednesday in Vienna. She called for an “expedited investigation” into who bears responsibility for three blasts that targeted the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines off the German coast. 
The Biden administration’s top energy official spoke in an interview at the International Atomic Energy Agency, where the US has this week been warning about Russia’s stranglehold on nuclear fuel markets. Germany’s Interior Ministry issued a general security threat on Wednesday after ruling out natural causes for the blasts on the Baltic Sea pipelines.

Update: US puts energy operators on ‘heightened alert’ (RT) 
WNU Editor: I will not be surprised that besides the U.S. and northern Europe a number of other countries around the world are now increasing their security on critical infrastructure. The Nord Stream pipeline attacks have clearly shaken most governments, and I shudder on what would be the reaction if another attack that is equivalent to the Nord Stream attack should happen again somewhere in the world.]]></summary>

(Xinhua/Xie Huanchi)   
Politico:  Calls grow for China and India to talk sense into Putin 
“They could let Mr. Putin know what a disastrously bad idea any use of nuclear weapons would be,” one U.S. official said. 
The U.S. and its allies are hoping to rally the international community to send an unmistakable message to Vladimir Putin: Using nuclear weapons would prompt a crippling economic and diplomatic response, even from Russia’s friends. 
 In particular, calls are growing inside and outside the Biden administration to enlist China and India, two major powers with close ties to Moscow, to amp up the pressure on Putin by signaling that even a limited nuclear strike in Ukraine would sever what few global lifelines Russia has left.

Europe is home to the most Chinese 'overseas police service stations' 
China has opened dozens of "overseas police service stations" around the globe to monitor its citizens living abroad, including one location in New York City and three in Toronto. 
"These operations eschew official bilateral police and judicial cooperation and violate the international rule of law, and may violate the territorial integrity in third countries involved in setting up a parallel policing mechanism using illegal methods," reads a report by Safeguard Defenders, a human rights watchdog, released earlier this month. 
The report, titled "110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild," details China's extensive efforts to combat "fraud" by its citizens living overseas, in part by opening several police stations on five continents that have assisted Chinese authorities in "carrying out policing operations on foreign soil."

* The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford will set sail on its maiden deployment next week from Hampton Roads, Virginia. 
* The Ford's first deployment comes four years after the ship was first expected to deploy. 
The $13 billion lead ship of a new class of advanced US Navy aircraft carriers is about to finally set sail on its first deployment after years of costly setbacks and delays that have at times made it the target of fierce criticism. 
The first-in-class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which was commissioned over five years ago and has been over a decade in the making, will deploy for the first time next week on a short, service-retained deployment, Vice Adm. Daniel Dwyer, US 2nd Fleet commander, told reporters.

Major leaks struck two underwater natural gas pipelines running from Russia to Germany, with experts reporting that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea beforehand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese Yuan banknotes are seen in this illustration taken February 10, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration 
Market Insider: China tells state banks to prepare for a massive dollar dump and yuan buying spree as Beijing's prior interventions have failed to stem its currency's worst year since 1994 
* Reuters reported that China told state-owned banks to get ready to sell dollars and buy yuan in an effort to prop up the local currency. 
* The move could stem the yuan's fall, as it remains on track for its largest annual loss against the dollar since 1994. 
* A hawkish Fed has pushed the dollar to 20-year highs this year, pressuring currencies around the world. 
The People's Bank of China has told major state-run banks to prepare to shed dollar holdings while snapping up offshore yuan, which has continued to fall despite prior interventions, sources told Reuters. 
The scale of this latest effort to prop up the yuan will be big and could provide a floor to the Chinese currency, according to the report. 
The amount of dollars to be sold hasn't been decided yet, but Reuters said it will primarily involve the state banks' currency reserves. Their offshore branches, including those based in Hong Kong, New York and London, were ordered to review offshore yuan holdings and check to see that dollar reserves are ready.

Update: Exclusive: China's state banks told to stock up for yuan intervention (Reuters).   
WNU Editor: IMHO there are three reasons why China will start to dump the US dollar. (1) The first is to prop up the yuan. (2) The second is to not possess US dollar reserves. China saw how the U.S. seized Russia's foreign currency holdings, and Beijing does not want to be positioned to have the same thing happen to them. (3) The third reason is that many in China believe the U.S. economy is on the road to a slow collapse, and what better way to bail-out is when the US dollar is as high as high as it is right now .... Is the US economy about to tank? (Gregory K. Tanaka, China Daily).]]></summary>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden, his administration pledging to help stave off China's "economic coercion," promised Pacific island leaders on Thursday to work harder with allies and partners to address their needs.
After a two-day Washington summit, the United States and leaders and representatives from 14 Pacific island states issued a joint declaration resolving to strengthen their partnership and saying that they shared a vision for a region where "democracy will be able to flourish."
Those endorsing the document included the prime minister of the Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, whose government had earlier indicated it would not sign the declaration, heightening concerns about his ties to China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: OPEC+ has begun talks on output cut at Oct. 5 meeting - OPEC source 
DUBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Leading OPEC+ members have begun discussions about an oil output cut at the group's next meeting on Oct. 5, three sources told Reuters. 
 One OPEC source told Reuters a cut was "likely", while two other OPEC+ sources said key members had spoken about the topic. 
A source familiar with Russian thinking told Reuters earlier this week that Moscow could suggest a cut of up to 1 million barrels per day (bpd).  The latest comments suggest that key OPEC members have started communicating over the matter, although the volume of any potential cut is still unclear. 
Next week's meeting takes place against a backdrop of falling oil prices from multi-year highs hit in March, and severe market volatility.

WNU Editor: My gut tells me that there will be a push at this OPEC+ meeting to cut production that will deliberately and significantly raise oil and gas prices to impact the US midterm elections, while bleeding the US strategic oil reserves at the same time.

Mahsa Amini, 22, from the Iranian Kurdish town of Saqez, was arrested this month in Tehran for "unsuitable attire" by the morality police that enforces the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women.
Her death has sparked the first big show of opposition on Iran's streets since authorities crushed protests against a rise in gasoline prices in 2019.
"At least 83 people including children, are confirmed to have been killed in (the) #IranProtests," Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, said on Twitter.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban have signed a provisional deal with Russia to supply gasoline, diesel, gas and wheat to Afghanistan, Acting Afghan Commerce and Industry Minister Haji Nooruddin Azizi told Reuters. 
Azizi said his ministry was working to diversify its trading partners and that Russia had offered the Taliban administration a discount to average global commodity prices. 
The move, the first known major international economic deal struck by the Taliban since they returned to power more than a year ago, could help to ease the Islamist movement's isolation that has effectively cut it off from the global banking system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Yorker reporter Susan Glasser revealed to The Bulwark's Charlie Sykes this week what she believed to be former President Donald Trump's "ultimate grift."
While appearing on Sykes' podcast, Glasser talked about how Trump lobbied to get himself nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his ultimately unfruitful efforts to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
"Donald Trump bragged and bragged and bragged about his, by the way, nonexistent nuclear deal with Kim Jong-un," Glasser said. "And he would go to rallies and say, 'Would you believe it, the prime minister of Japan has nominated me for a Nobel Peace Prize!'"
There was much more to Trump's nomination for the prestigious prize than met the eye, however.

"Then we learn, in the course of reporting for this book, that, in fact, the reason Shinzo Abe nominated Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize is that Donald Trump had him to a private dinner, just the two of them, at Trump Tower in the fall of 2018 at which he asked Shinzo Abe to nominate him."
Trump ultimately didn't care about winning the prize, said Glasser, as much as being able to brag about having been nominated.
"To me that is the ultimate grift," she said. "A fake nuclear deal, a fake nomination for the Peace Prize, it's got it all."
Trump ultimately was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

VP Harris visited the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to show America's 'rock-solid commitment' to South Korea's security  Vice President Kamala Harris made an unfortunate gaffe during her speech at the Korean Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Thursday, saying that the U.S. has a "strong alliance" with "the Republic of North Korea." 
 "It is an alliance that is strong and enduring," she added, intending to refer to the Republic of Korea, which is South Korea's official name. 
The vice president then continued her remarks by professing the U.S.' support for South Korea's defense against the increasingly aggressive North Korean government.

The ceremony would take place on Friday at 15:00 local time (08:00 ET) in the Kremlin’s St. George’s Hall, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
Putin will deliver a speech and meet with Russian-backed leaders of the four occupied regions on the sidelines of the ceremony, he added.

Giving a presentation in Toronto tomorrow. It is a rush thing, and I am preparing for it right now. Flying out tonight, and returning Saturday evening. 
I gave a presentation last week to a business group on what to expect geopolitically in the spring of 2023 and beyond. Apparently I freaked-out a lot of people who were there on what I see is trending, especially on the war, and after the Nord Stream pipeline attacks this week they now want me to present it to a larger audience tomorrow.
Needless to say blogging will be light until then, but I have time posted a number of interesting stories for Friday and Saturday that I know will be of interest to the followers of this blog.]]></summary>
