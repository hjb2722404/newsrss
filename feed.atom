        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former DFAT Australia-China Council scholar Andrew Phelan says the US sanctions recently imposed on the export of high-end computer chips to China have had a “dramatic” and immediate effect on manufacturing in the country. 

The Biden administration recently announced a set of controls that restrict the export of advanced chips, chipmaking equipment and design software created with technology from the United States. 

“Every American engineering executive involved in the chip manufacturing, chip industry in China has resigned, effectively immediately,” Mr Phelan told Sky News Australia. 

“And ASML, the Dutch supplier of the capital equipment that is used in making high-end chips has ceased servicing its Chinese customers. 

“So … I think the Americans anticipated the third term, they were worried about China’s advances in chips, in artificial intelligence, in weaponizing these things, so they have stepped in, in what is the biggest I think US move against China in the last several years.”]]></summary>

Sitharaman has already called for global collaboration to decide the future of crypto and has been cautious against mainstream crypto adoption citing financial stability risks.  However, speaking to local Indian journalists on October 15, she confirmed, “This (crypto) will also be part of India’s business (agenda during the G20 presidency).
The G20, or Group of Twenty, is a global forum for addressing major issues related to the global economy.  According to Sitharaman, no country alone can effectively manage or regulate crypto, adding that:

“But if it’s platforms, asset exchanges that have been created, buying and selling making profits and most importantly, these countries are able to understand the trade of money, are we able to establish for what purpose it is used?

Sitharaman further pointed to the use of crypto assets in money laundering, detected by India’s law enforcement agency, the Enforcement Directorate. 
She added that G20 members have also acknowledged the same concerns while reiterating the need for all countries to participate when it comes to effectively regulating crypto assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis said the need to reform the United Nations was "more than obvious" after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war exposed its limits, in an extract of his new book published Sunday.
The Argentine pontiff said Russia's February invasion of Ukraine highlighted the need to ensure the current multilateral structure -- especially the UN Security Council -- finds "more agile and effective ways of resolving conflicts".
"In wartime, it is essential to affirm that we need more multilateralism and a better multilateralism," but the UN is no longer fit for "new realities", he added in an extract published by La Stampa daily.
The organization was founded to prevent the horrors of two World Wars from happening again, but although the threat represented by those conflicts was still alive, "today's world is no longer the same", said Francis.
"The necessity of these reforms became more than obvious after the pandemic" when the current multilateral system "showed all its limits", he added.
Francis denounced the unequal distribution of vaccines as a "glaring example" of the law of the strongest prevailing over solidarity.
The 85-year-old advocated "organic reforms" aimed at allowing international organizations to rediscover their essential purpose of "serving the human family" and said international institutions must be the result of the "widest possible consensus".
The pope also proposed guaranteeing food, health, economic and social rights on which international institutions would base their decisions.
Francis's new book, "I ask you in the name of God: Ten prayers for a future of hope", is due to come out in Italy Tuesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two people were killed after torrential rain brought major flooding to the Greek island of Crete, firefighters said on Sunday.
Rain started to fall on Saturday morning in the southern Greek island, a popular holiday destination, hitting the Heraklion region particularly hard.
Greek firefighters said the body of a 49-year-old woman was found in the sea on Sunday, raising the death toll to two from the floods.
On Saturday, a man in his 50s was found dead after he was trapped in his car as torrential rains began.
The two individuals were going to Heraklion for work, Greek public television ERT reported.
A second missing individual was found alive on Saturday evening.
The rains forced the evacuation of several homes and unleashed extensive damage in seaside villages, where streets became rivers carrying away everything in their path, local media reported.
The flash floods pushed several cars into the sea along the beach of the seaside resort of Agia Pelagia, with some almost completely submerged in the water surrounded by debris.
The beach was covered in scrap including plastic bottles and toys, next to straw umbrellas.
The flooding also damaged more than 15 shops, mainly fine restaurants, in Agia Pelagia, popular with wealthy diners.
The Civil Defence department said it was mobilised and asked all citizens to be vigilant on Sunday in Crete and the surrounding islands of Rhodes, Karpathos, Kastellorizo and Kasos.

Should everything go to plan for Xi, the 69-year-old will be reconfirmed as the party's general secretary after the week-long meeting, cementing his position as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.
A heavy police presence was in place around Beijing early Sunday as authorities prepared for the twice-a-decade Congress -- set to open at 10 am (0200 GMT) at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square.
A fleet of buses whisked journalists and other attendees to a virtually empty square rimmed by fluttering red flags and bathed in autumn sunshine.

The 38-year-old Chilean American now crosses over to work in San Diego as an English teacher during the day and returns home in the evening to Mexico.
"One of the biggest reasons is the cost of living in Tijuana. It's significantly cheaper than in California," Zarate said.
Also, he added: "I love Mexican people and food."
His neighbor and fellow English teacher Mike Rachfal also made the move from San Diego, where he used to pay $1,275 a month to rent a studio.
"Here it's about half that," the 36-year-old said.
The cheaper rents can be a sensitive subject in Mexico, where wages are much lower than in the United States …]]></summary>

“He was in one of the last meetings Kwasi Kwarteng had as UK Chancellor of the Exchequer before Kwarteng was sacked by Prime Minister Liz Truss in Britain,” Mr Clennell said. 

“Kwarteng appeared agitated and distracted during the meetings apparently - and some of the speeches at the G20 finance ministers forum must have been uncomfortable for him - given they all stressed having your budget in line with central bank policy, and the UK Chancellor, then UK Chancellor, had gone for some big unscheduled tax cuts.

“Our Treasurer met with the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell just hours after a surprise high annual inflation figure of 8.2 per cent was recorded in the US.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the largest individual donors in the 2022 midterm elections is seeking to obtain citizenship in Malta, The New York Times reported on Saturday.
The newspaper based its report on documents it had viewed and "three people with knowledge of the matter."
"Mr. Thiel, 55, is in the process of acquiring at least his third passport even as he expands his financial influence over American politics," the newspaper reported. "Since backing Donald J. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the technology investor has become one of the largest individual donors in the midterm elections next month, spending more than $30 million on more than a dozen right-wing Congressional candidates who have decried globalization and pledged to put America first."
Thiel also has a New Zealand passport.
"There is no obvious tax benefit to Mr. Thiel to gaining Maltese citizenship, lawyers and immigration experts said, though wealthy Saudi, Russian and Chinese citizens sometimes seek a passport from the island nation for European Union access and to hedge against social or political turmoil at home," The Times reported. "What is clear is that a Maltese passport would give Mr. Thiel an escape hatch from the United States if his spending doesn’t change the country to his liking."
Thiel has been a major backer of the U.S. Senate campaigns of Blake Masters in Arizona and J.D. Vance in Ohio.
"Both candidates have espoused a form of nationalism that, in part, blames globalization and leaders’ involvement in international affairs for American stagnation," the newspaper reported. "Mr. Thiel has endorsed that worldview with his money and in speeches, including one at the National Conservatism Conference last year where he called nationalism 'a corrective' to the 'brain-dead, one-world state' of globalism."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starlink, a constellation of more than 3,000 small satellites in low Earth orbit, has been vital to Ukraine's communications as it battles Russia.
	

		But Musk has found himself embroiled of late in public spats with Ukrainian leaders who were angered by his controversial proposals for de-escalating the conflict, which included acknowledging Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
	

		"The hell with it," Musk, the world's richest man, wrote on Twitter.
	

		"Even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free."
	

		In a series of tweets Friday, Musk had detailed the logistics of the operation and said it was costing SpaceX nearly $20 million per month, and suggested the company could not fund it indefini…]]></summary>

		Although Ukrainian troops have recaptured thousands of square kilometres (miles) of land in recent offensives in the east and south, officials say progress is likely to slow once Kyiv's forces meet more determined resistance.
	

		Fighting is particularly intense in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk provinces bordering Russia. Together they make up the larger industrial Donbas, which Moscow has yet to fully capture.
	

		Russian forces have repeatedly tried to seize Bakhmut, which sits on a main road leading to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Both are situated in the Donetsk region.

Fox News’ highest rated host and mercurial the rapper, producer and fashion impresario enjoyed mutually beneficial media attention — which included relentless post-game coverage on Fox News — after their long encounter.
West, or Ye as he prefers to be called now, sat down with Carlson after making headlines at a fashion show in Paris where he proudly wore a “White Lives Matter” shirt.  The ensuing outrage aligned nicely with Carlson’s quest to prove that white people are under attack, so Carlson invited West on his show to continue that mission.

“People can finally start to get out of this mountain of debt to pay rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a house, starting a family or starting a business,” Biden said    at the White House in remarks detailing the plan.  “And by the way, when that happens, the whole economy gets better.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For high school teacher and mother Jennifer Shaffer, time and sleep are two precious assets.  So with the end of DST    approaching, the busy mother says she fears changing the clock. 
“It’s definitely going to mess us up and mess us up over the next few days, even a week,” Shaffer told CBS News. 
She is not alone.  according to one vote conducted by Monmouth University, six out of 10 Americans said they would rather make daylight saving time permanent — abandoning the practice of changing the clock twice a year created during World War I to save energy.

Turning our clocks back and forth may soon be a thing of the past – if a few lawmakers get their way.
This year, Congress brought the issue into the spotlight when the House energy committee heard testimony at a formal hearing about how changing the clock is linked to increased risk of depression, stroke and sleep disorders.  According to National Children’s Hospital sleep specialist Dr.  Tyish Hall Brown, changing watches can have an impact on the body.
“We have a kind of internal rhythm to our bodies and our health,” Brown said.  “And every time we move forward or backward, that too has to adjust.”
In March, the US Senate unanimously legislation passed    without warning to make DST permanent starting in 2023, if the US House and President agree.
Michigan Congressman Fred Upton said the effort will likely fall short in the House, in part because some people in the western section of the time zones say they are concerned that permanent daylight saving time could make mornings too dark and late. 
“Not only would [school buses] running in the dark, the kids would probably be in the second or third hour while it was still dark,” he said. 
Nearly 15 years ago, Upton championed an energy-saving law that extended DST    even later in November. 
“Particularly with global warming, climate change is real,” he said.  “Why not take advantage of this extra hour of sunlight?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At a time when Republicans across the country are trying to downplay or flee Trump, Eric Trump went on TV to announce that the Republican Party is now Trump’s party.
video:

Eric Trump on Newsmax:
When we’re on that stage, we know you’re going to find out who your true friends are. My father was the first thing he said to our family, you know? I love fighting for this country. We use a surprising number of arrows, but we love red, white and blue. Well, I sure hope my dad does it again. 
I think he is the best president this country has ever had. He is willing to fight. No other Republican is willing to fight and I think he fundamentally changed the party. Republicans are no longer Republicans. This is the Trump Party.
Republicans are in a tight House race across the country. Swing district candidates are trying to pretend Donald Trump doesn’t exist, and here’s Eric Trump reminding America that voting for any Republican on the 2022 ballot is as good as voting for Donald Trump.
Republicans likely won’t win control of the Senate, as Trump’s Senate roster is a massive failure.
The GOP needs Donald Trump to leave on Election Day. His presence in the midterms hurt Republican voters. Instead, Eric Trump is touching his father’s ego and reminding every voter in America that the Republican Party that was once the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan now belongs to Donald Trump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. students are struggling even as the government provides school districts with billions of dollars in COVID-19 relief to offset learning losses, according to a study released Tuesday. The study said federal generosity was insufficient, failed to target schools most in need, and was not associated with policy outcomes.
Analysts at the American Educational Research Association said schools may need $700 billion to address learning losses, mainly from remote instruction, but received about $189 billion in emergency relief funds for elementary and secondary schools in 2020 and 2021.
The funds, including the roughly $120 billion invested last year in President Biden’s massive pandemic relief bill, are aimed at measures such as increasing tutoring, offering extracurricular activities and buy…]]></summary>

Harvard Law's Laurence Tribe, who has argued three-dozen cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, penned the analysis with Dennis Aftergut, a fellow high court litigator.
"In the annals of successful political extortions, few rival the one that took place in Munich more than 80 years ago," Tribe and Aftergut wrote for The Bulwark. "On September 29, 1938, two days before a deadline that Hitler had announced for invading Czechoslovakia, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain yielded and agreed to meet with the German chancellor. In the Bavarian capital, they signed a 'nonaggression' pact that ceded the territory to Hitler wit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An oil depot in Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine is on fire after being shelled on Saturday, the governor said, as strikes increase against the area.
"We're getting bombed again. One of the shells hit the oil depot in the Belgorod region," regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
He said emergency services were already on site, adding there was "no risk" of the fire spreading.
Gladkov posted a photo showing flames and plumes of black smoke rising above a building.
State-run news agency TASS cited a source in the emergency services saying the burning depot was located in the village of Razumnoye-71, near the city of Belgorod.
Last week Russia complained of an increase in artillery and missile strikes on its territory bordering Ukraine.
The Belgorod region has regularly come under fire.
The capital of the region, also called Belgorod, had been hit more rarely.
But on Friday a power station in the city was set on fire by a Ukrainian strike, causing electricity cuts.
This came a day after a rocket gutted the top floor of an apartment building in the city of Belgorod, without causing injuries.
A munition depot in the region was also destroyed on Thursday.
Earlier in the week, Ukrainian strikes knocked out power in the town of Shebekino, in the same region. A 74-year-old woman died and several others were wounded in the town.

What Xi learned from the Soviet Union, the US, and the Arab Spring.
 When Xi Jinping was elected general secretary of the Chinese Community Party in 2012, one of the first things he did was take his senior colleagues to the National Museum in Tiananmen Square. 
The seven new top leaders of China walked through the “Road to Revival” exhibition, a fairly straightforward nationalist history of the country, from the first Opium War in 1840 through the present. 
There, Xi delivered a speech about the Chinese dream in which he set forward the goal of “achieving the great revival of the Chinese nation.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's new finance minister warned Saturday of tax hikes to come as he admitted to "mistakes" made by his short-lived predecessor in a disastrous budget.
Jeremy Hunt was making his first comments to media following his appointment as chancellor of the exchequer by Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose own future is in doubt mere weeks after she took office.
"We will have some very difficult decisions ahead," Hunt told Sky News, warning that "all government departments" face spending restraint. 
"And some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want. Some taxes will go up," he added.
Tax cuts were the centrepiece of the budget announced by Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng on September 23. But they were financed through billions in more borrowing, causing panic on financial markets which has fed into higher costs for British households.
Truss fired Kwarteng on Friday and rowed back further on the planned tax cuts, but is facing threats of being toppled by senior Conservative MPs aghast at the party's collapse in opinion polls since she replaced Boris Johnson on September 6.
"There were mistakes," acknowledged Hunt, a former health and foreign secretary who is seen as a centrist Tory brought in by Truss to steady her listing ship.
Kwarteng and Truss had initially wanted to cut taxes for the highest earners, and had presented their budget without independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, Hunt noted in summarizing two key mistakes.
"The prime minister's recognized that, that's why I'm here."

A trove of sensitive information was stolen from the Mexican defense ministry by the collective called Guacamaya, which has also claimed cyberattacks in Chile, Colombia and Peru.
"Their objectives are more political than economic," said Diego Macor, a cyber-security expert at US technology giant IBM in Chile, who describes members of the network as "hacker-activists."
The leaks revealed that the Mexican army continued to use Pegasus spyware developed by Israeli firm NSO Group after President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in 2018, according to an investigation by the Network in Defense of Digit…]]></summary>

Russia’s barbaric missile attack on civilians was doomed to backfire. Here’s why Putin did it anyway.
 Less than 48 hours after the Kerch Bridge connecting Crimea with Russia proper was damaged by a powerful blast, Vladimir Putin retaliated against Ukraine. Russia fired close to a hundred missiles at a variety of Ukrainian cities this past Monday and Tuesday. The rockets hit an array of buildings, including residences and schools, killing at least 19 civilians and injuring more than 100. 
While the missile attacks knocked out power and water to Ukraine’s largest cities, the value of the attacks was dubious at best. No mil…]]></summary>

The yen struck a new three-decade dollar low as a rise in US inflation expectations cemented expectations of more hefty Federal Reserve rate hikes.
Truss sacked finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng as pressure mounted on her government following last month's big-spending, tax-slashing mini-budget, which spooked markets.
The September 23 budget sent the pound tumbling to a record dollar low, near parity with the greenback, and bond yields surged before stabilizing thanks to interventions by the Bank of England. 
Sterling sank more than one percent to under $1.12 after Truss dismissed Kwarteng.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A penthouse in Florida Rob Gronkowski praised during his time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he netted $5.4 million, The Post has learned. 
The former NFL party block sets a record as the building’s all-time most expensive listing, known as the Towers of Channelside in Tampa. 
Comprised of four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms, the luxury residence boasts 180-degree views of the bay and the Tampa skyline — stretching all the way to downtown St. Pete, according to the listing. 
Built in 2011, this is the first time this unit has come to market since it was built. 
Features include a private lobby and elevator entrance, plus your own private pool cabana. 
The unit features 10-foot floor-to-ceiling windows, a gourmet kitchen, and a 1,100-square-foot wraparound deck. 
The property includes a 24-hour concierge, clubhouse, and resort-style pool with heated spa and rock waterfall. 
The unit is in the luxurious Towers of Channelside building.

“An opulent oasis, each element has been designed to enhance its breathtaking views and provide functionality for every lifestyle.”  Listing agent Nick Janovsky, of Premier Sotheby’s International Realty, told the Post.  “It also presents a rare opportunity to own a penthouse in Tampa’s original luxury skyscraper.”
In the three years Gronk lived in the luxury unit, the team won the Super Bowl and qualified for the playoffs. 
Meanwhile, he still owns a five-bedroom, six-bathroom unit in Miami that spans over 3,770 square feet. He bought the 39th floor residence in 2019 for $1.7 million. 
Considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time, Gronk, 33, announced his retirement for the second time on June 21, 2022.

The Hidalgo County GOP headquarters was busy in mid-September when CBS News knocked on its doors in McAllen, Texas.  The lobby was filled with candidate plaques and stickers of a list of Republican candidates.  Inside, Hidalgo County GOP Chair Adrienne Pena-Garza ran a phone bank for GOP candidates — something she says was unheard of for just a few election cycles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BARTIN, Turkey (Reuters) - An explosion in a coal mine in Turkey's northern Bartin province on Friday killed 28 people, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said, as rescue teams continued to search for people trapped underground.
Eleven of the 58 rescued miners were still getting treatment in hospitals, Koca also said on Twitter, but it was not clear how many people were still trapped due to the blast that occurred as 110 people were working.
Authorities said initial indications were that the blast was caused by firedamp, a term referring to methane in coal mines.
Colleagues and families of the miners were waiting at the sidelines of the scene and at hospitals where the wounded are being treated, Reuters and local media footage showed.
In 2014, 301 workers were killed in Turkey 's worst ever mining disaster in the western town of Soma, 350 kms (217 miles) south of Istanbul.

video:

Walker: You don’t need insulin if you don’t eat well, so food prices are more important (??????) #GASen Debate pic.twitter.com/LesqASABk7
— Pat Dennis (@patdennis) October 14, 2022

Walker said: “I believe in reducing insulin, but at the same time, you have to eat well because he may not know and I know a lot of people who are using insulin and unless you are eating well, insulin is not good for you. So you have to reduce food price.”
This is not how insulin works. People with diabetes cannot make their diabetes go away just by eating right.
Herschel Walker is a disaster in this debate. He’s not a good debater, but Walker has the standard Fox News talking points on these issues.  Herschel Walker thinks he won the debate by interrupting and yelling.
Walker’s actions came straight out of Donald Trump’s playbook in 2016.
Herschel Walker may be the country’s most extreme Senate candidate this year, and blaming insulin prices on diabetics is a new low.

Thompson assured critics on Thursday that the committee’s findings were not part of a broad liberal conspiracy portrayed in conservative media.

“The Court shall… reverse the district court’s injunction and terminate the special master’s review,” the prosecutors wrote.
The Justice Department’s request came in its appeal to the 11th Circuit to reverse the decision of a lower court that appointed a special master, or independent arbitrator, to review the thousands of documents seized at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in August.

Herschel Walker was asked to come up with a concrete idea to reduce inflation, so he blamed Joe Biden and Senator Warnock. Walker struggled immediately when it came to the first question. His answer is energy independence. Asked if he would cut military spending or social services spending, Walker said he would not cut energy bills.
Warnock was asked if he was responsible for the economic hardship facing Georgians, and Senator Warnock noted that businesses were making record profits and touted the biggest tax cut for working and middle-class families. Warnock then told Walker he needed to explain why he wanted the higher price.  Herschel Walker says diab…]]></summary>

Areas of three southeastern states - Victoria, New South Wales and the island state of Tasmania - are under emergency flood warnings after an intense weather system this week brought more than a month's worth of rain to the southeast.

Reuters: Turkey backs Putin gas plan as Nord Stream faces long outage 
LONDON (Reuters) - Large sections of the damaged Nord Stream pipelines built to supply gas to Europe might need to be replaced, the head of Gazprom said, while Turkey on Friday backed Russian proposals to build a gas hub there as an alternative supply route. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin this week proposed Turkey as a base for gas supplies after the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged last month by blasts. 
The European Union, which previously turned to Russia for about 40% of its gas needs, is however seeking to wean itself off Russian energy following the invasion of Ukraine in February.

        <updated>2022-10-14T19:42:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Ukrainian investigators have completed the exhumation of soldiers in one of two mass graves discovered after Russian troops retreated from the town of Lyman in eastern Donetsk region, police said on Friday.
"Police have removed the bodies of 34 Ukrainian defenders from the mass grave," Donetsk regional police said in a statement. "Work continues at a second location where more than 120 civilians are buried. The fate of each person who died will be determined."
The soldiers' bodies have all been transferred to a morgue and will be returned to their relatives for burial once identification has taken place and the cause of death is determined, the police said.
Since Sept. 29, Donetsk police said they had found the bodies of 144 people, 85 of them civilians, with 108 exhumed from makeshift graves, and the rest found in buildings or on the streets.
"Most of the dead -- 85 -- are civilians," they said. "Some of them have signs of violent death, in particular shrapnel injuries.
Ukraine's top prosecutor told a joint news conference with International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan in The Hague on Thursday that Ukraine had 28 investigative teams on the ground in areas recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces.
Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said retreating Russian troops had left evidence of illegal detention and torture of civilians and deportations. Khan, who opened an ICC investigation in March, would not be drawn on when his office might file its first case, saying he would move forward "when the evidence is sufficient".
In Lyman, graves marked as holding the bodies of people killed in May, when Russians were battling to seize Lyman, include those for children as young as one, Reuters reported this week. Reuters could not independently determine the causes or timing of the deaths.
Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly accused Russian troops of committing atrocities in occupied territories, a charge Moscow denies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked Ukraine's Defenders Day holiday on Friday by promising victory over Russia and freedom for Ukraine.
In a video address delivered on hills outside the capital Kyiv, Zelenskiy thanked Ukraine's armed forces for defending their country. He said everything that had been taken away from Ukraine would be returned, and no soldier left in captivity.
"It seems that the current enemy in its evil unites all the enemies of our statehood that we faced before," Zelenskiy said on the wooded hills outside the village of Vitachyv, site of an historic military outpost overlooking the Dnipro River.
"By defeating this enemy, we will respond to all enemies who encroached on Ukraine - on those who lived, who live and who will live on our land. This will be a victory for all our people. This will be a victory for the Armed Forces of Ukraine."
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, launched on Feb. 24, has killed thousands, displaced millions, pulverised cities and damaged the global economy.
Ukrainian forces have made advances in recent weeks, but Russia has carried out heavy air strikes that hit energy facilities as well as apartment blocks this week.
"The world sees that Ukrainians do not lose their humanity under any circumstances. The enemy can strike at our cities, but never at our dignity," Zelenskiy, who was dressed in khaki, said in his video address marking the Oct. 14 public holiday.

The select committee is investigating the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021 and its causes, with the aim of determining who was responsible for the chaos and preventing it from happening again.
Trump did not mention the subpoena and instead criticized the committee;  he said he was writing “to express our anger, disappointment and grievance at all the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on what many consider a hoax and witch hunt”.  He also attacked the committee for failing to investigate voter fraud and appeared to defend the committee’s targets, who he said were merely acting “as con…]]></summary>

The Washington Post reported:
U.S. Chief District Judge Beryl A. Howell has ruled in a sealed decision that could clear the way for other top Trump White House officials to answer questions before a grand jury that Pence’s former chief of staff Mark Short may have had the Information important to criminals The investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol was not available from other sources, one of the people said.
Trump appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined to delay Short’s appearance while the lawsuit continued, a sign that Trump’s attempts to invoke executive privilege to protect the confidentiality of the president’s decisions are not likely to be accounted for, people familiar with the matter said. upper hand.

On Wednesday, a Connecticut jury did its best to force the Infowars host and owner to face the consequences of the harm his lies caused others, ordering Jones to pay $965 million to relatives of the victims of a mass shooting in 2012 and to an FBI agent whom he accused of being all actors.

In a interview with “PBS NewsHour”, litigator Jesse Gessin describe    the nearly billion-dollar judgment as “probably one of the largest libel verdicts in United States history.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newly released documentary footage appears to show Roger Stone losing it and calling Ivanka Trump an abortion because her father refused to pardon him again.
Stone video:

Unreleased subpoena footage: Stone, angry at Trump for not granting him a second pardon, calls Ivanka Trump the daughter of an abortion bitch. pic.twitter.com/aAAOZLC5fu
— Christopher Gould Branson (@cguld) October 14, 2022

Stone said in the clip: “Jared Kushner has an IQ of 70. He’s going to come to Miami. We’re going to kick him out of Miami very quickly. He’s going to leave soon, very soon. He’s got a hundred guards. I’m going to have 5,000 security guards. Do you want to fight? Let’s fight. Fuck you. Fuck you, and your aborted bitch daughter.”
The Jan. 6 attacks, Trump’s coup plot, and narcissism fueled the perpetrators’ decision-making process, and a documentary film crew followed them, giving us an insight into how Trump and those around him operate.
Roger Stone was upset that Donald Trump refused to grant him a second pardon, ostensibly to cover up his activities in the 1/6 attack.
Here’s the Stone video from the documentary filmmaker who posted the above footage, released by the committee on Thursday, Jan. 6:

Recently, the select committee obtained footage of Roger Stone before and after the election. pic.twitter.com/6mRdWwMSmE
— January 6 Committee (@January6thCmte) October 13, 2022

Even before yesterday’s hearing, Zachary Petrizzo was the daily beast Stone ‘threatened to file a $25 million lawsuit against Danish filmmakers – Frederick Mabel and Christopher Gould Branson – who took his picture in November, saying’ Fuck the vote and let’s face violence.'”
Stone may return to the prison where he belongs. Trump’s longtime adviser is a go-between for the Trump campaign and Russia, and has performed the same functions for Trump on 1/6 with the militia.
The failed former president was surrounded by criminal associates like Roger Stone who were only interested in himself.

At the same time, U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen said he would continue to bar the federal government from approving new DACA applications, a block he first issued in July 2021when he agreed with arguments put forward by Republican-led states and declared the program illegal.

The Russian president stressed that at the moment no direct talks with any of the leaders of the other states participating in the G20 summit were on the agenda

"He should be asked whether he is ready to hold such negotiations with me or not. To be honest, I don’t see any need by and large. There is no platform for any negotiations for the time being," Putin told the media on Friday, when asked about the possibility of a meeting with Biden at the G20 summit in Indonesia.

"I want to make it clear: what is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly. But we would have had the same thing a little bit later, only in different conditions, far worse for us," the Russian leader stressed 
ASTANA, October 14. /TASS/. Russia is acting correctly and in a timely manner in the current situation involving Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin told the media on Friday. 
"No," Putin replied when asked, if he had any regrets.

Update: Putin Says He Has No Regrets About Ukraine Invasion After Reverses (Bloomberg)   
WNU Editor: His body language when asked that question was very clear. With his shrug, especially when he said that he does not want to destroy Ukraine, tells me that as far as he is concerned he had no choice. 
Here is an easy prediction. Years and decades from now historians are going to be debating if Putin did have a choice, and how different everything would have been if a different choice was available and taken.]]></summary>

The move comes as Musk has been embroiled in public spats with Ukranian leaders who were angered by his controversial proposals for de-escalating the conflict, which included acknowledging Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
Starlink, a constellation of over 3,000 small satellites in low Earth orbit, has been vital to Ukraine's war effort against Russia, with SpaceX donating some 25,000 ground terminals, according to an updated figure given by Musk last week.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Friday that no one should dare think they can uproot the Islamic Republic, in his toughest warning to protesters since Mahsa Amini's death in police custody ignited nationwide unrest now in its fourth week.
Demonstrations by people from all walks of life, after the Iranian Kurdish woman's death following her arrest for "inappropriate attire", have evolved into widespread calls for the downfall of Khamenei and "Death to the Islamic Republic".
The protests mark one of the boldest challenges to clerical rule since the 1979 revolution, even if the unrest does not seem close to toppling the system.
Khamenei compared the Islamic Republic to an unshakeable tree. "That seedling is a mighty tree now and no one sh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow was conducting its nearly eight-month invasion of Ukraine correctly, despite his forces' early failure to topple Kyiv and a string of recent embarrassing battlefield defeats.
But his comments came hours after Kremlin-installed officials in Ukraine's southern region of Kherson urged residents to leave, pointing to nearing Ukrainian artillery and as Kyiv announced its forces were pushing closer towards the region's main city.
And on Thursday Moscow also hinted at the potentially wide extent of the damage dealt to the Crimea bridge, saying it could take many months to complete repairs after a recent blast rocked the key supply link between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula.

‘Nothing further is being planned’ after draft of 300,000 is complete, Russian president claims. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday claimed his country’s so-called partial mobilization of reservists to fight in the Ukraine war, announced last month, will end in around two weeks. 
“This work is already coming to an end,” Putin said at a press conference in Astana, where he traveled to participate in a conference. 
“There are now 222,000 people mobilized in the troop formations, out of 300,000. I think that within about two weeks all mobilization activities will be completed.”  Putin also said that “nothing further is being planned … within the foreseeable future,” as his defense ministry had not requested further troops.
