Russia plans to launch a new large-scale offensive within the next 10 days.   
Source: Financial Times with reference to an unnamed adviser to the Armed Forces of Ukraine   
Details: The Financial Times writes that Kyiv has obtained "very solid intelligence of intent" by Russia to launch a new attack. 
The Russian offensive will likely aim to capture the entire Donbas region and may begin in the west of Luhansk Oblast, near the cities of Kreminna and Lyman, where Russia has been assembling forces for several weeks. 
The Financial Times also notes that Russia is building up its troops in the south of Donetsk Oblast, with additional forces being deployed to villages around occupied Mariupol. 
According to the Financial Times, Russia’s goal is to launch the offensive before Ukraine receives Western tanks and weapons.

Deadly earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria, where war and economic crises already loomed. Here’s the latest news.
 Thousands of people were killed after a pair of powerful earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria in the early morning hours of February 6. The first quake — a 7.8 magnitude temblor, equal to the strongest quake ever recorded in Turkey — was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake and scores of powerful aftershocks. 
These earthquakes come on top of a more than 10-year civil war in Syria, which has destabilized the region for years. The country is still suffering from an ongoing — and chronically underfunded — humanitarian emergency. Millions are displaced within Syria or have fled to Turkey, which is contending with high inflation and a deepening economic crisis. The earthquake unleashed widespread damage and destruction in some of the most at-risk areas in the region.
Thousands are injured, and the death toll continues to rise as search-and-rescue operations continue in difficult, cold, and stormy conditions. Freezing weather is hampering some of the recovery efforts, as the window to find survivors gets narrower and narrower.
This is a developing story. Follow along for the latest news, updates, and how to help.]]></summary>

EurAsian Times: Taiwan Is Deploying ‘Cheap’ Minelayers & Their Mines With US Help To Target ‘Expensive’ Chinese Warships 
Many in Taiwan and their supporters in the strategic community in the United States seem to favor applying one lesson learned from the ongoing war in Ukraine against China to thwart its aggressive designs on the island nation.

Insider: Losses in Ukraine are 'out of proportion' to what NATO has been planning for, the alliance's top general says 
* NATO leaders have been worried by the heavy casualties and massive ammunition usage in Ukraine. 
* "The scale of this war is out of proportion with all of our recent thinking," NATO's top general said in January. 
The heavy casualties and massive ammunition consumption seen during the war in Ukraine has top NATO commanders worried. 
NATO was created in 1949 to stop a massive Soviet invasion of Western Europe, and it has added new members since the end of the Cold War, but many of its militaries shrank in the decades after the Soviet threat disappeared. Now the scale and intensity of the fighting in Ukraine has raised questions about the alliance's ability to fight a big-unit war against Russia. 
"Scale, scale, scale," US Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told a Swedish defense conference in January. "The magnitude of this war is incredible. The Ukrainians have 37 frontline brigades, plus dozens more territorial brigades. The Russians have lost almost 2,000 tanks. If we average out since the beginning of the war, the slow days and fast days, the Russians have expended on average well over 20,000 artillery rounds per day."

   Polskie Radio: Polish PM calls on West to step up support for Ukraine  
Poland’s prime minister has said that Ukraine needs hope and more support from the West to repel the Russian invasion, adding that victory would mean “a renaissance of the Western civilization.” 
Mateusz Morawiecki made the statement at a conference on support for Ukraine, which is being held in the Polish capital Warsaw on Monday, Polish state news agency PAP reported.   The PM told the audience: “Europe’s cooperation with Russia seemed cheap and efficient, until Vladimir Putin asked Europe to foot the bill. 
These seemingly normal contracts for the purchase of gas turned out to be a chirograph in which Europe sold its soul.”

The head of the Russian Movement for Navy Support, Vladimir Maltsev, told TASS, “The Dmitry Donskoy submarine cruiser has been decommissioned from the Russian Navy. It will await utilization at a naval base in Severodvinsk with two other units of this project.”

Bloomberg: Germany Studies Tapping Coal-Exit Funds for Defense Projects 
Germany is considering re-routing existing subsidies for eliminating coal-fired power plants to help defense manufacturers build new production facilities, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The discussions between Germany’s federal government and regional states are aimed at providing the country’s armed forces with more weapons and ammunition and creating jobs in regions that are affected by the shift away from coal, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are confidential. 
Germany’s Bundeswehr has been suffering from outdated and partly dysfunctional equipment for years. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the German government last year earmarked 100 billion euros ($109 billion) in defense spending to expand and modernize its armed forces. 
A spokeswoman for the Economy Ministry did not have an immediate comment.

 It’s a particularly dangerous moment for Israel and Palestine.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the Middle East last week on a previously scheduled trip after 48 hours of violence: a terrorist attack in East Jerusalem killed seven Israelis and an Israeli raid on the refugee camp of Jenin killed nine Palestinians, culminating a month in which Palestinians experienced the highest level of killings at the hands of Israeli forces and Israeli settlers i…]]></summary>

Insider: Israel is considering sending its Iron Dome air defense system to Ukraine, Netanyahu says 
* Israel is looking into sending its Iron Dome system to Ukraine, Prime Minister Netanyahu said. 
* Israel has a complex relationship with Russia and has so far held off aiding Ukraine militarily. 
* But Netanyahu now says he is open to considering Ukraine's request. 
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government is considering sending its Iron Dome to Ukraine. 
The Iron Dome is arguably the world's most advanced missile defense system, designed to intercept barrages of rockets and artillery shells. 
In an interview with French TV outlets TF1 and LCI broadcast on Sunday, Netanyahu was asked about sending the missile defense system to Ukraine, in response to the country's continuing appeals for military support. 
He told the interviewer: "I'm looking into it. I said I'm looking into it and I'm doing just that," echoing a statement he made to CNN last week.

The requests, which also include an expression of support for the country’s territorial integrity, medical treatment in Israel and the development of anti-missile technology, fall short of previous asks Kyiv has made for defensive weaponry, but may still force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government into an uncomfortable stance as it seeks to navigate between the warring allies.

Defense One:  Some Ospreys on Flight Restrictions Pending Part Replacement 
U.S. military limiting the lifespan of a gearbox part to address V-22 hard clutch incidents. 
The Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force will implement a time limit on a gearbox part in the V-22 Osprey as part of the military’s efforts to resolve the aircraft’s hard clutch problem. 
Air Force Special Operations Command grounded their Ospreys in August because of concerns with the hard clutch, though the Marines and Navy continued flying the tiltrotor aircraft. AFSOC returned their Ospreys to the air in September. 
The flight hour limit comes from the V-22 Joint Program Office’s 24 initiatives to find solutions to the problem, the official said.  “This recommendation was based on a progressive increase in these hard clutch engagement events. And from that, and looking at the totality of the data, we in recent weeks have been able to determine that this time limit was an appropriate step for us to take,” the defense official said.

Daily Mail: China FIRES its weather service chief as it doubles down on claim spy balloon seen over Montana nuclear base was blown off course monitoring the weather - as American recovery efforts for wreckage begin off South Carolina coast 
* Zhuang Guotai, the head of the China Meteorological Administration, was fired on Sunday, according to reports 
* The Chinese foreign ministry said that shooting the balloon down on Saturday was 'clearly an overreaction that seriously violates international practice' 
* The United States is now attempting to recover the debris from the balloon from off the coast of South Carolina 
China fired its top meteorologist on Sunday, as the fallout from the spy balloon saga continues, and efforts to recover the downed balloon were ongoing off the coast of South Carolina. 
Joe Biden on Saturday ordered that F22 fighters shoot the balloon out of the sky, as soon as it passed the coast and headed out to see. 
Pentagon chiefs warned Biden against shooting it down over land, arguing that the debris could cause damage to property and risk lives.

Chinese authorities have confirmed that an “unmanned aircraft” flying over Latin America originated in China, even as Beijing stepped up its protests against the U.S. military’s decision to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that traversed the United States last week. 
At a regular news briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that the second balloon came also from China but claimed that it was used for civilian flight tests. “Due to the impact of weather and limited self-steering ability, this aircraft seriously deviated from its scheduled course,” Mao said. 
The Pentagon had identified the vehicle as another suspected Chinese surveillance device, similar to the huge white globe spotted by civilians Wednesday as it hung over the U.S. state of Montana. Beijing said that one was a weather balloon blown off-course.

On Tuesday, President Joe Biden will deliver his second State of the Union address, making the case that the economy has done well under his leadership. That will be a hard sell to most Americans because, as the latest I&I/TIPP Poll shows, a solid majority say they are worse off financially than they were two years ago. 
The online I&I/TIPP Poll asked 1,358 Americans a simple question: “Are you better off today than you were two years ago, or not?” Possible responses were “Yes, better off,” “No, not better off,” and “Not sure.” The poll, which was taken from Feb. 1-3, has a margin of error of +/-2.8 percentage points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OilPrice.com: Goldman Sachs Warns Of An Imminent Oil Supply Shortage 
Crude oil could soon swing into a deficit that will make next year a difficult one, Goldman Sachs said, as spare production capacity dwindles and underinvestment threatens future supply.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event in Saudi Arabia, Goldman’s top commodity analyst Jeffrey Currie said, as quoted by Bloomberg, that the industry is not spending enough to secure future production and that spare capacity globally is declining. 
This could tip the oil market into a serious supply problem next year, but the price for a barrel of Brent could top $100 before then. 
According to Currie, rising demand from China and sanctions on Russian oil will contribute to the deficit, which he expects to manifest in the second quarter of this year. In response, producers will tap their spare capacity, leaving it lower than it was before. Eventually, this will lead to a serious imbalance between supply and demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breitbart: Report: Biden Administration Tried to Hide Chinese Spy Balloon from American Public 
The Biden administration was aware of the Chinese spy balloon entering United States airspace on January 28 but tried to hide its existence from the American people until being forced to go public, according to a report on Saturday.
Bloomberg News reported that the Biden administration was “well aware” that the balloon had entered U.S. airspace on Saturday, January 28, but decided to keep quiet about it so as not to ruin a planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China. 
The outlet reported:     
As it turns out, US authorities were well aware of the unidentified object that had entered American airspace on Jan. 28, that had then left and re-entered over North Idaho on Tuesday. But with such a high-profile trip at stake, keeping it on the down-low was key. 
However, on Wednesday, February 1, a Billings, Montana, resident spotted the balloon around 5:30 p.m. local time, and the next day, a local Montana paper published a report about it. Later that day, late Thursday afternoon, the Pentagon finally confirmed the existence of the balloon. 
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: It was only when the local public media started to report on the balloon that the Pentagon was finally forced to respond. So yes. It does look like this was a situation where some, at least in the Pentagon, wanted this story to not be made public for as long as possible.   
Update: This is a must read post from Bloomberg on the White House's response to this Chinese "spy" balloon .... From China to Big Sky: The Balloon That Unnerved the White House (Bloomberg).   
Update #2: Michael Ramirez is brutal (see below).]]></summary>

    EurAsian Times: Israel Identifies ‘3000 Targets’ Inside Iran To Strike Its Critical Military Infra – French Media Report 
Iran recently accused its fiercest rival and adversary in the region, Israel, of a drone attack on its military facility and vowed retaliation for the incident. In contrast, Israel is allegedly planning to stitch an anti-Iran military coalition to wipe our Iranian nukes. 
Corresponding with Iran’s ferocious warning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began his first visit to France after he returned to power. As speculated, the interaction between the two countries leaders was dominated by the Iranian question. 
French President Emmanuel Macron denounced Iran’s “headlong race” to build its nuclear program following a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu at the Élysée Palace. This is significant as recent local French media reports have claimed that Israeli outreach to France is part of a plot to stitch an anti-Iran military coalition.

WNU Editor: I am skeptical that such an anti-Iran military coalition would form let alone strike Iran. 
Such a conflict will result in the immediate closure of the Straits of Hormuz to oil traffic, and a loss of almost a quarter of the world's oil production.
$300/barrel for oil and the economic shock-waves that such a war would unleash is something that the West is unprepared for. I also sense that there is no Western public appetite to get involved in such a conflict, nor any real political will.]]></summary>

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Former army chief and high NATO official Petr Pavel won the Czech Republic's presidential election on Saturday with a pledge to keep the country firmly anchored in the West and bridge society's political differences.
Pavel, a 61-year-old retired general running for office for the first time, won 58.3% of the vote with all voting districts reporting final results, defeating billionaire ex-premier Andrej Babis, a dominant but polarising force in Czech politics for a decade.
Pavel, a social liberal who had campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, conveyed a message of unity when addressing his supporters and journalists at a Prague concert venue on Saturday as results showed he had won.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.
Offensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.
Thierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.
"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination," Murangira said.
"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB."
"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime."
Rwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.
Under Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.
Anyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.
Mukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
It was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.
The 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's Congress rejected on Saturday a request by embattled President Dina Boluarte to bring forward elections to December 2023, as protests that have killed dozens rage on against her leadership.
The South American country has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections, Castillo supporters have erected roadblocks on highways, causing shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.
Lawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.

Cases of malnutrition and malaria in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, prompting the new leftist government of President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva to declare a health emergency.
Of the nearly 60 Indigenous children being treated at the San Antonio children's hospital in Boa Vista, in the northern state of Roraima, three-quarters of them are Yanomami, and eight of those are in intensive care, according to official data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis has clarified his recent comments about homosexuality and sin, saying he was merely referring to official Catholic moral teaching that teaches that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.
And in a note Friday, Francis recalled that even black-and-white teaching is subject to circumstances that might eliminate the sin altogether.
Francis first made the comments in an interview Jan. 24 with The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws criminalizing homosexuality were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.”
As he often does, Francis then imagined a conversation with someone who raised the matter of the church’s official teaching, which states that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scottish actor Alan Cumming said on Friday he had returned a UK state honor in protest at the "toxicity" of the British Empire, 14 years after receiving the award.
Cumming, who is largely US-based, was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2009 in recognition of his acting and his work for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States.
But he said he had reflected further on the role of the monarchy after the death last year of Queen Elizabeth II.
That refection, "and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes", Cumming said in an Instagram post marking his 58th birthday.
Gay rights had advanced meanwhile in the United States, and any benefit from the award was "now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire", Cumming said.
"So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!"
The queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.
Further back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.

Police said they were called at around 1310 GMT to a seriously injured man at Cambridge Circus, in the heart of London's West End, the city's theatre district.
The man is believed to have been working on a "telescopic urinal" when he became trapped, police said.
"We're sorry to have to update that, despite the efforts of emergency services, the man who was critically injured in Cambridge Circus was pronounced dead at the scene," Metropolitan Police tweeted.
Telescopic urinals are pop-up facilities that remain underground during the day, but rise to street level at night to cater for those out in the city.
London Fire Brigade said firefighters had been called to a person trapped below street level underneath a hydraulic urinal.
"Firefighters worked with partner agencies and used a winch to free him. He was left in the care of London Ambulance Service and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene."
Four fire engines and around 25 firefighters attended the scene.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.
Peru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.
His supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.
Boluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.
"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration," said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.
Congress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.
"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence," added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a "quagmire."
But protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.
In seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.
Some of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.
Those southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.
As well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.
That resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged three members of an Eastern European criminal organization with ties to Iran's government with conspiring to assassinate a journalist and activist who is an American citizen, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Rafat Amirov, Polad Omarov and Khalid Mehdiyev were charged with murder-for-hire and money laundering for their role in the thwarted Tehran-backed plot, the Department of Justice said in a statement.
"The victim publicized (the) Iranian government's human rights abuses, discriminatory treatment of women, suppression of democratic participation and expression and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and execution," Garland said.
Garland did not name the alleged victim, but Mehdiyev was arrested last year in New York for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist Masih Alinejad, a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws who has promoted videos of women violating those laws on social media.
Amirov was arrested on Thursday and will have a pretrial hearing in federal court in Manhattan later on Friday. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic earlier this month.

Judge Patrick Field called Daniel Harris, 19, "highly dangerous" and a "propagandist for an extremist right-wing ideology".
"You were in close touch with other right-wing extremists online and there can be little doubt that you shared ideas between you," Field told Harris in court.
Harris was found guilty in December of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one count of possession of material for terrorist purposes, for trying to make a gun with a 3D printer.
The judge at Manchester Crown Court in northern England sentenced Harris to 11 and a half years, with a further three years under supervised probation.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.
"IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS," he wrote. "SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!"
Earlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.

"FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES," Trump said. "Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!"
During his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.
Trump also called Putin a "genius" at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.]]></summary>

The space rock known as 2023 BU is expected to pass about 2,200 miles over the southern tip of South America at 7:27 p.m. EST on Friday, and was only detected last weekend by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, reported BBC.
"Before encountering Earth, the asteroid's orbit around the Sun was roughly circular, approximating Earth's orbit, taking 359 days to complete its orbit about the Sun," NASA said in a statement. "After its encounter, the asteroid's orbit will be more elongated, moving it out to about halfway between Earth's and Mars' orbits at its farthest point from the sun. The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days."
The asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.

The rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.]]></summary>
