        <updated>2022-05-12T23:15:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, TechCrunch reported that Congress is asking major social media platforms to archive content showing evidence of Russian war crimes in the invasion of Ukraine.
Four representatives sent letters making the request to Meta (the parent company of Facebook), Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok.
"As TikTok booms in popularity and surpasses 1 billion users, the rise of short-form video has offered unprecedented access to live footage from war zones — not to mention that Meta, YouTube and Twitter continue to capture our attention, too," reported Amanda Silberling. "These members of congress — Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and William Keating (D-MA) — think that social media uploads can be instrumental in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations accountable."

"In particular, the four representatives are calling on these platforms to preserve and archive potentially useful content for an extended period of time; coordinate with international human rights organizations to develop a legal, established way to share such content; increase transparency around AI-based content moderation systems and how they interface with war content; and, creating a way for users to flag content that they think might contain evidence of war crimes," said the report.
The Russian army has been accused of repeated war crimes as part of the Ukraine invasion, from the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol to the butchering of unarmed civilians in Bucha.
Russia has denied all accusations, claiming that they are only going after military targets and sticking to their discredited story they are trying to "denazify" the country.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During a segment on CNN this Thursday, the panel discussed the day's news regarding the Jan. 6 committee's subpoenas of five House Republicans. According to CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger, one of the lawmakers subpoenaed, Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, "might actually be willing to testify." 
According to Borger, Brooks spoke at the infamous "Stop the Steal" rally on Jan. 6 that preceded the riot, only to later be passed over by former President Donald Trump for an endorsement in his reelection race. 
Borger also pointed out that Brooks has already publicly revealed that Trump asked him to help "rescind" the 2020 election. 
"If he's already said it publicly, why not say it to the committee?" Borger said.

"The IEA, after warning on March 16 that 3 million barrels per day could be shut in from April, lowered that figure for a second time as it noted only 1 million barrels per day had gone offline. Production ramping up elsewhere and slower demand growth due to China's lockdowns will forestall a big deficit, the Paris-based IEA said," said the report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia is paying a heavy price for its invasion of Ukraine, but Ret. Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson warned on CNN Thursday that the conflict is far from over.
While discussing Russia's stalled efforts to take over the eastern part of Ukraine, Anderson also touched on Finland's decision to apply for NATO membership, which he said showed that the military alliance of Western powers is growing stronger in the face of Russian aggression.
"I would submit to you, we're heading back to a Cold War, I think," he said. "I think there will be a stalemate in the Ukraine. Get ready for Cold War II."
Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, did not join NATO during the first Cold War, although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dramatically changed the calculus in Helsinki, as Finland's president and prime minister both came out in favor of joining on Thursday.
RELATED: More 'blowback' for Putin as Finland applies for NATO membership
Addressing the conflict in Ukraine, Anderson said that it appeared Russia's strategic options in eastern Ukraine appear limited even though they have a significantly larger military than the Ukrainians do.
"They're using artillery to blow the hell out of everything in their way, that's their only play," he said of the Russian military. "But they're really failing... their strategy is flawed in that they're devoting too many resources to smaller salients and they're not concentrated in one area. And we already have seen significant counterattacks up here by the Ukrainians."

The metaverse refers to virtual worlds in which internet users can interact through avatars to play, shop and work. The enforcement actions accuse Flamingo Casino Club of scamming people through fraudulently selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that purport to convey ownership of a virtual casino and give investors a right to share in the profits of the casino when other users play virtual games such as craps, blackjack or roulette. NFTs are digital items in which their ownership is permanently stored on the blockch…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activists from the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) unfurled two large banners on the Acropolis in Athens on Thursday in protest at Greece's indirect participation in the war in Ukraine through its membership of NATO.
The banners in both Greek and English read: "No to War - No Involvement - No to the Bases of Death" in large letters visible from a considerable distance.
The protest came ahead of a vote in parliament on Thursday evening on extending for a further five years an agreement on military cooperation with the United States. At the end of the period, the agreement is set to become permanent, if neither party withdraws.
Ratification is seen as a formality, as Greece's conservative government has the necessary majority. The government sees the agreement as enhancing stability and Greece's role in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The US already has a large naval and air base at Souda on Crete, from where its planes can cover the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The US also operates two military bases in central Greece and a naval base in the port of Alexandroupolis in the north-east of the country.
The KKE, which holds 15 seats in the 300-seat parliament, has for decades demanded that Greece should withdraw from both NATO and the European Union.]]></summary>

The first public admission of COVID infections highlights the potential for a major crisis in a country that has refused international help with vaccinations and kept its borders shut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The arrest of a 90-year-old Catholic cardinal under Hong Kong's national security law has triggered international outrage and deepened concerns over China's crackdown on freedoms in the financial hub.
Retired cardinal Joseph Zen, one of the most senior Catholic clerics in Asia, was among a group of veteran democracy advocates arrested Wednesday on a charge of "colluding with foreign forces".
Cantonese pop singer Denise Ho, veteran barrister Margaret Ng and prominent cultural studies scholar Hui Po-keung were also arrested, the latter at the airport as he attempted to travel to Europe to take up an academic post.
The four were detained for their involvement in a now-disbanded defense fund that helped pay legal and medical costs for those arrested in the huge and sometimes violent democracy …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rock, the biggest white diamond ever auctioned, sold for 21.7 million Swiss francs ($21.9 million) on Wednesday, far short of the record for such a jewel.
The 228.31-carat stone, larger than a golf ball, was sold in Geneva by Christie's auction house.
There had been high hopes that The Rock would smash the world record for a white diamond, which stands at $33.7 million, a sum fetched in Geneva in 2017 for a 163.41-carat gem.
But the bidding, which started at 14 million Swiss francs, ground to a halt after two minutes at 18.6 million, with the price rising to 21.7 million once the buyer's premium was added on.
The pre-sale estimate had been 19-30 million Swiss francs.
The Rock, a perfectly symmetrical pear-shaped diamond, was sold by an unnamed owner from North America. It was bought by…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With their infectious musical fusion of roots and rhythm, Ukrainian folk hiphop band Kalush Orchestra is riding a wave of goodwill at the Eurovision Song Contest this year -- while eyeing the contest's top prize.
Tapping traditional Ukrainian folk music but mashing up an invigorating hiphop beat with a haunting, lullaby refrain, "Stefania" was written last year by the band's frontman, 27-year-old rapper Oleh Psiuk, as a tribute to his mother.
But the song selected to represent Ukraine at Eurovision -- just days before Russia's invasion -- has taken on outsized meaning for a country nearing its third month of war. It contains nostalgic lyrics such as "I'll always find my way home even if all the roads are destroyed" and celebrates cultural identity and the motherland.

International tourist arrivals worldwide have more than doubled, up 130 percent in January 2022 on the same period last year, according to the latest UN World Tourism Organization figures.
Travelers are regaining confidence, and Europe and the Americas are leading the resurgence.
Worldwide, there have been 18 million additional visitors, the UNWTO said, "equivalent to the total increase recorded over the whole of 2021".
In 2019, global tourism revenues reached $1.48 trillion. That figure dropped by almost two thirds due to the pandemic the following year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thing Australia needs is for both government and opposition to be "closing down options" with China rather than keeping them open, says University of Melbourne’s Professor Michael Wesley.

"Both sides are now sort of burnishing their national security credentials, burnishing their toughness – and what that does is remove creative possibilities for taking the relationship forward pragmatically," Prof Wesley told Sky News Australia.

He said he was not optimistic about the trajectory of Australia's relationship with China.

"We've needlessly blown out of proportion the significance of the China-Solomon Islands agreement – it's very hard to walk back from that now.

"I do worry that if not locked into this level of antagonism, there will certainly be a sort of a cold relationship between Australia and its major trading partner for awhile yet."]]></summary>

"As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance," they wrote. "Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days."
Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, has traditionally stayed away from NATO membership in the interest of maintaining a diplomatic balance between Russia and other Western European nations.

Financial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon comments that the decision by Finland to apply for NATO membership now can only be seen as "yet more blowback from Moscow’s war in Ukraine," which has also resulted in an unprecedented number of crippling sanctions that internal Kremlin forecasts show could led to a 12 percent contraction of gross domestic product this year alone.
Now that Finland is applying for NATO membership, the next question will be whether Sweden, which has also traditionally tried to remain militarily neutral between Russia and Western Europe, will follow suit.]]></summary>

Lufthansa's boss apologized on Wednesday for an incident in which a group of Jews was removed from a plane because of a dispute with a few individuals who failed to follow rules about wearing masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.
The apology relates to a May 4 incident. After a flight from New York to Frankfurt, during which some individuals did not comply with rules regarding masks, the airline had all members of a tour group of Orthodox Jews removed from a continuing flight to Budapest.
The airline had already issued a statement of apology on Tuesday, noting it was unfortunate that the entire group was removed when the dispute had only been with certain individuals.
"We apologize to all guests, not just because they couldn't travel further, but because their personal feelings were hurt," read the Tuesday statement.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr on Wednesday apologized to a representative of the Jewish community in Berlin, according to Lufthansa. That followed a company meeting in which Spohr told employees that such incidents cannot happen.
"Anti-Semitism has no place at Lufthansa. The incidences of last Wednesday should never have happened and have to be cleared up comprehensively."]]></summary>

Research shared exclusively with The Guardian ahead of its formal publication identifies at least 195 "carbon bombs" that are either in the process of being built or already in place across the globe as scientists warn that fossil fuel use must be quickly phased out to prevent catastrophic climate outcomes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Newsweek reported that billionaire investor Bill Ackman is urging U.S. companies to hire Ukrainians to engineering jobs, because Americans lack the same level of "work ethic".
"In a Tuesday tweet, the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management said he had dinner with a number of startup CEOs who had complained about the work ethic of young American engineers," reported Khaleda Rahman. "He suggested that employers should instead look to hiring people from Ukraine as Russia's invasion of the country continues."
But — Ackman was careful to note — companies shouldn't go through all the trouble of bringing Ukrainians out of their war-torn country to come to the U.S. to take those jobs, but simply have them work remotely.

To be clear, I recommend hiring Ukrainian engineers virtually, not recruiting them to the US, which takes time and will drain talent from @Ukraine. We should find Ukrainians work and dignity now so they can provide for their families and country.https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1523852028241457152\u00a0\u2026

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has devastated huge sections of the country and created a massive refugee crisis, as Russian forces commit horrifying war crimes in occupied territory.

The Biden administration has committed to admitting in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, with 6,000 already approved for entry into the U.S.
Ackman's comments also come as U.S. businesses are facing a sharp uptick in workers resigning to pursue other job opportunities, a trend known as the "Great Resignation" as a labor shortage causes workers to start questioning the value of working lower-pay, less-secure jobs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The unprecedented economic sanctions leveled against Russia haven't stopped the country from continuing its war in Ukraine -- but they have succeeded in crushing its economy.
Bloomberg reports that leaked economic forecasts from Russia's Finance Ministry project that the Russian economy will shrink by as much as 12 percent this year as crippling economic sanctions wipe out roughly an entire decade's worth of economic growth.
This would also mark the worst economic crisis for Russia since the 1990s when the collapse of the Soviet Union sent the country's economy spiraling downward.
Natalia Lavrova, chief economist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, tells Bloomberg that there is no easy fix for Russia going forward.

“The main negatives are the oil embargo, the EU giving up Russian gas, along with more departures among foreign companies,” she explained. “All that will probably expand gradually, with a lot of negative carrying over in to 2023.”
Major Western nations launched sanctions against Russia earlier this year after the country launched an unprovoked war against neighboring Ukraine.
Although many intelligence experts believed Russia would be able to quickly overrun Ukraine militarily, Russia has failed to achieve its objective of taking over the capital of Kyiv and has also faced significant setbacks in its efforts to take over the eastern region of the country.

The Qatar-based TV channel said Israeli forces shot Abu Akleh, 51, deliberately and "in cold blood" while she was covering unrest in the Jenin refugee camp. 
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett however said it was "likely" that Palestinian gunfire killed her. 
Another Al Jazeera journalist, producer Ali al-Samudi, was wounded in the incident, the broadcaster added.
An AFP photographer said Abu Akleh was wearing a press flak jacket when she was shot. The photographer reported that Israeli forces were firing in the area and then saw Abu Akleh's body lying on the ground.

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/tokyo-to-recognize-same-partnerships-from-november/"/>
        <updated>2022-05-11T11:01:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokyo will begin recognizing same-sex partnerships from November after revising current rules, officials said Wednesday, becoming the largest city in Japan to do so.
Japan is the only nation of the Group of Seven countries that does not recognize same-sex unions, and its constitution stipulates that "marriage shall be only with the mutual consent of both sexes".

But in recent years, local authorities across the country have made moves to recognize same-sex partnerships, although such recognition does not carry the same rights as marriage under the law.
"We collected opinions from the public for the past two months and we heard opinions (from same-sex couples) who said they want to be recognized as partners," a Tokyo government spokesman told AFP.
The metropolitan government plans to ask legislators to approve revising a local ordinance next month, and will then begin accepting applications for the certificates in October and issuing them in November.
The city is considering offering various services currently only available to married couples to those with the partnership certificate, including applying for city-administered apartments, the spokesman said.
Tokyo's Shibuya district in 2015 became the first place in Japan to begin issuing symbolic "partnership" certificates to same-sex couples.
Many areas have followed suit, with activists saying more than 200 municipalities now recognize same-sex partnerships, granting couples rights including the ability to visit a partner in hospital and rent property together.
In a landmark ruling last year, a court in northern Sapporo said Japan's failure to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, a verdict hailed by campaigners as a major victory.
But Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been cautious on the possibility of any legislative changes at the national level to recognize same-sex unions.
Taiwan is currently the only place in Asia with marriage equality, having taken the unprecedented step of legalizing same-sex unions in 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paraguayan anti-drug prosecutor Marcelo Pecci was shot dead execution-style Tuesday while honeymooning on a Colombian Caribbean island by attackers who fled by sea, police and his widow said.
Paraguay's president denounced the crime as a "cowardly murder" and a fellow prosecutor said the modus operandi was reminiscent of "the mafia."
Pecci, 45, was felled by two shots while relaxing on a beach on the idyllic tourist island of Baru, according to his wife, Paraguayan journalist Claudia Aguilera.
The couple got married on April 30 in the nearby city of Cartagena.
"Two men attacked Marcelo. They came (by sea) in a small boat, or on a jet ski, the truth is I did not see well," Aguilera told the El Tiempo newspaper.
One of the assailants got out and "without a word he shot Marcelo twice, one (bu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Hong Kong court ruled on Wednesday that prosecutors could label organizers of the city's annual Tiananmen vigil "foreign agents" without having to reveal who the group is accused of working for.
The decision was made on national security grounds but those being prosecuted argue that the precedent-setting ruling makes it harder to prepare their defense ahead of trial.
For three decades, the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance held vigils commemorating victims of China's deadly 1989 crackdown on democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
Those commemorations have been driven underground since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong following democracy protests three years ago.
Authorities charged the alliance with "incitement to subversion", a national security …]]></summary>

Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian entry for this year's Eurovision Song Contest, has made it into Saturday's grand final in Turin.
Kalush Orchestra advanced in the first semi-final late Tuesday along with nine other countries.
The musicians from western Ukraine and their song "Stefania" are the favourites for overall victory at this year's Grand Prix in the northern Italian city.
Artists from a total of 17 countries took part in the first semi- final on Tuesday.
The band has been vocal in expressing its support for Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion on social media since the armed conflict began.
Russia has been excluded from this year's Eurovision, as has its neighbour and close ally Belarus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his new tell-all book, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper criticized Ric Grenell, who became Donald Trump's acting director of national intelligence (DNI) for a few months in 2020. 
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told members of the House Intelligence Committee Russia was already trying to interfere with the 2020 election. Trump swiftly fired Maguire and replaced him with Grenell. 
According to Esper, "there were a number of people in the administration who would willingly do Trump’s bidding, and probably even his more extreme dictates, and it deeply concerned me." Grenell, he explained, was one of them. 
Trump would brag about Grenell like it was a grand strategy to force the hand of the Senate Republicans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended his invasion of Ukraine, saying it was a necessary blow against NATO. His remarks came during Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations on May 9 marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, are increasingly describing the fighting in Ukraine as a proxy war between the U.S. and Russia. We speak with the Quincy Institute’s Anatol Lieven, who says the war can only end through negotiations, and aggressive U.S. rhetoric risks prolonging the fighting. “That is a recipe for this war going on essentially forever, with colossal suffering for Ukraine,” says Lieven.

According to the British Foreign Office, UK, US and EU cyber security experts have met to assess new intelligence linking the February attack directly to the Russian state.
"This is clear and shocking evidence of a deliberate and malicious attack by Russia against Ukraine which had significant consequences on ordinary people and businesses in Ukraine and across Europe," UK foreign minister Liz Truss said.

US intelligence says there are “indications” that Russia wants to build a land bridge through Ukraine to Transnistria, a strip of land in Moldova. 
 Over the weekend, pro-Russian separatists claimed that Ukrainian drones dropped explosives on an airfield in Transnistria, a pro-Russia breakaway region of Moldova bordering Ukraine. Western analysts have cast a lot of doubt on those drone claims, but they came two weeks after a series of explosions were reported in the region. No one was injured in either event, but they were a reminder of the risks if the Ukraine wa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to invade Ukraine more than two months ago, he no doubt expected an easy victory from a lightning-fast assault intended to crush the smaller opposing force. This spectacular victory was meant to advance the Russian president's vision of a new manifest destiny, bringing his country closer to re-establishing itself as an imperial power on the global stage. But Putin's gambit failed in grand fashion. Instead of celebrating a victory on May 9 — the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II — the Russian military is trying to reorganize itself after a series of stunning defeats and great losses in both materiel and personnel.
Speed was the key element in the Russian plan, but surprisingly strong and effective resistance …]]></summary>

In an attack on Esper in a letter to CBS News, Trump said that Esper was so weak that he personally had to run the military to defeat ISIS. But the book describes the defense team being forced to create a chart to explain to Trump how an attack on Iran would work. 
Trump met with congressional leaders on the afternoon of June 20, telling them he was about to bomb Iran after they shot down a U.S. surveillance drone. But by the end of the day, "with ships readying missiles and airplanes already in the skies, told the Pentagon to call off the airstrikes with only …]]></summary>

VISBY, Sweden (Reuters) - The crack of gunshots splits the silence in a sleepy forest as Camilla Selander, a deli-counter worker, squeezes off shots from her Glock 9 millimetre pistol during target practice with Sweden's Home Guard on the island of Gotland.
The 34-year-old is one of the volunteers practising at a military firing range on the island, likely to be on the front line of any future confrontation between Russia and Sweden.
The island lies just 300 km (186 miles) from the home of Russia's Baltic Fleet in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland.

The music and dance ritual known as "zar", with centuries-old roots in Ethiopia and Sudan, is traditionally performed to ward off or exorcise jinn or evil spirits.
"We're not quacks or witches," said Umm Sameh, aged in her 70s, with kohl-lined eyes, large hoops swaying in her ears and gold bracelets tinkling on her arms.
"The singing is spiritual and brings out negative energies," said the lead singer of the Mazaher ensemble, adding that they also perform prayers from Islam's mystic Sufi practices.
