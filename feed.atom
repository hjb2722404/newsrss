        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Johnny Depp has issued a statement saying he is "truly humbled" to have won his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard as she revealed her shock to the verdict.

The jury found Ms Heard defamed him in her 2018 Washington Post article, alleging she was domestically abused by him. 

The jury of five men and two women reached the verdict unanimously – saying Depp had proven all elements of defamation.

The jury also found the majority of Ms Heard's allegations to be false and conveyed a defamatory implication.

She was awarded $US2 million for one of her claims, but Johnny Depp is to receive $US15 million in total damages.

Depp said the jury’s decision gave him his life back and that he was “truly humbled” by the outcome.

"Speaking the truth was something that I owed to my children and to all those who have remained steadfast in their support of me,” he said in a statement.

“I feel at peace knowing I have finally accomplished that."

Ms Heard also issued a statement saying she was disappointed she had lost the right “to speak freely and openly”.

"The disappointment I feel today is beyond words," Heard said.

"I'm heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence and sway of my ex-husband.

"I'm even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nick Coyle, partner of Chinese-Australian journalist Cheng Lei who was formally arrested in China in February 2021, has spoken out for the first time in an exclusive interview with Sky News Australia – raising his concerns on the issue. 

Ms Lei, 46, who worked for Chinese state broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN) as an anchor, was detained in August 2020 before being formally arrested in February 2021 on suspicion of “illegally supplying state records overseas”. 

Mr Coyle raised concerns about the suspension of consular visits and the decline of her health in detention. 

He said regular consular visits have been suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions in Beijing, which he finds “totally unacceptable” as it’s the one of things that has kept his partner going for 20 months. 

“I mean, she’s been able to make no phone calls with anybody, she’s had what? Maybe three visits from her lawyer just to prepare for the trial, she’s not had one phone call with family, with children, nothing,” he said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Benedicts still find happy moments in their home.  Sometimes they play Uno together.  Sabrina is brimming with excitement when she shows off her mom’s ballet moves or talks about upcoming vacations, her favorite meals or her day at school.  Or they flip through photo albums, remembering vacations on Assateague Island.
One afternoon last year, Sabrina sat at the kitchen counter, drawing an intricate plan of a house where she imagined one of her teachers lived.  When Crystol arrived home, Sabrina ran to greet her.  Then she collapsed on the sofa in anticipation of a massage.  Her mother knelt beside her.  Crystol pretended to make pizza on his daughter’s back – kneading the dough, spreading the sauce and sprinkling the cheese.
But within an hour, Sabrina would be overwhelmed with disappointment, frustration, or some emotion she couldn’t name.  She stamped her foot, hard.  And start moaning.
“Do you need help?”  her father asked, his voice even, his eyes averted.
Between moans, Sabrina announced, “I’m crazy.”  But she stopped her parents’ efforts to talk to her.  “I hate you,” she said.  “Leave!”
At times like this, her mother encourages her to breathe in and out.  “Smell the roses and blow out the candles,” she says.  And his parents are there, frozen, waiting for the continuation.
When Crystol first saw Sabrina, asleep in a crib in the hospital, she cried with happiness.  It was July 2008. Unable to have a baby on their own, she and Jeremy had become foster parents, planning to adopt.  They brought Sabrina home when she was only a day and a half old.
They weren’t intimidated by what the fostering agency told them: Sabrina’s biological mother and father both had developmental disabilities and the father had been arrested for sexual assault.

The US' decision to redeploy 500 troops to Somalia to help in the fight against militant Islamists is a clear sign of its support for new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.
The redeployment came after former US President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of the troops in December 2020 following years of strained relations with his predecessor Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed "Farmajo", who was voted out of office by Somalia's lawmakers. 
The US considered him to be a failure both in terms of governance and the campaign against Islamist militant groups al-Shabab and the much smaller Somali branch of the Islamic State (IS) group.

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin claimed that up to 70% of tickets presented at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis were fake.  He said at a press conference on Monday that the “root cause” chaos was about 30,000–40,000 English fans carrying counterfeit tickets – or no tickets – that blocked entrances.
But according to official figures reviewed by The New York Times, the exact number of counterfeit tickets intercepted by gate stewards was much lower: 2,589, to be exact.

The machinations in the Lehigh County case have been watched intensely by Mr. McCormick and Dr. Oz, who are separated by less than 1,000 votes with a statewide recount underway in their race, which could ultimately determine control of the divided Senate.

As Russian troops capture territory, a Pentagon official said their “laborious and incremental” pace is wearing them down and the army’s overall combat strength has been reduced by about 20%.  And since the war began, Russia has lost 1,000 tanks, a senior Pentagon official said last week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s on the ballot?
There is a wide range of races for positions statewide, as well as many local competitions.  You’ll be asked to make your choice for Governor (Governor Gavin Newsom is up for re-election), Lieutenant Governor, Treasurer, Attorney General and more.
You will be asked to vote for a representative of the House.  And you’ll be asked to vote for the US senator – twice: once to fill out the rest of Vice President Kamala Harris’ term, which ends in January, and once for the full six-year term that begins after that. .
Then, depending on where you live, you’ll have local elections for your city council, district attorney, mayor, state legislators and more.  (In San Francisco, for example, voters will be asked if they should recall Chesa Boudin, the district attorney.)
How does the California primary system work?
Since 2011, California has had what’s called a first-two primary system, which means the top two candidates will advance in the November general election, regardless of their political party.  The November races could be matchups between two Democrats or two Republicans, rather than between the top Democrat and the top Republican.
In almost all statewide elections, there will be a runoff, even if a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.  The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is a notable exception.
In local races, a candidate can win with the majority of votes.  The most publicized example is the race for mayor of Los Angeles.  (If a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote this month, they will become mayor without facing a runoff in November.)
Who should I vote for?
Of course, we cannot answer that.  But you may want to read your local newspaper’s recommendations, as they will have interviewed candidates.  here are the candidates endorsed by the Los Angeles Times in state and local elections in Southern California.  The Sacramento Bee has compiled its endorsements here.  And here’s the San Francisco Chronicle list of endorsements for national and local elections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: Biden says the US will give Ukraine more advanced rocket systems but won't enable the country to 'strike beyond its borders' 
* President Joe Biden says the US will provide more advanced rocket systems to Ukraine. 
* Ukraine has been asking the US for long-range artillery, which it says is needed for its defense. 
* These systems have double the range of the M777 howitzers that the US previously sent to Ukraine. 
The US will be providing Ukraine with more advanced rocket systems and munitions to allow Ukrainian forces to "more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield," President Joe Biden wrote in a Tuesday op-ed for The New York Times. 
However, these weapons are only meant for Kyiv's forces to inflict casualties within Ukraine, and the US isn't "encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders," Biden added. 
"We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia," he wrote, per The Times.

Reuters: Russia and Saudi Foreign Ministers Praise OPEC+, Says Moscow 
(Reuters) -Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud in Riyadh on Tuesday and both men praised the level of cooperation inside OPEC+, the Russian foreign ministry said. 
The comments were issued amid Western media reports that some members of OPEC+, an alliance of OPEC members and their allies, were considering removing Russia from the group. 
"They noted the stabilising effect that the tight cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia has on world markets for hydrocarbons in this strategically important sector," the ministry said in a statement on its website.  There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia outside of business hours.

But the best-of-five-set format remains a different kind of challenge than the best-of-three-set variety played on the regular tour.  For now, Alcaraz’s best results in major tournaments are the quarter-finals at the US Open last year and now in Paris.
“I didn’t start well, and at this level, quarter-final of a Grand Slam, you are playing against the best players in the world, so you have to start the game better than I did today” , said Alcaraz.  “I have to follow the lesson.  I mean, I have to improve for the next Grand Slam or the next games.  But I would say that I am not far from reaching a semi-final or winning a Grand Slam.
Zverev, a semi-finalist at Roland Garros last year, clearly felt the odds were stacked against him on Tuesday in light of recent results at Alcaraz.  Alcaraz had won the Barcelona and Madrid titles back-to-back on red clay and were on their way back to Roland Garros after saving a match point against fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos-Viñolas in the second round.
“I knew I had to play my best tennis today from the start, and I’m glad I did,” Zverev said.  “Obviously he kept coming back. He’s an amazing player. I told him at the net, he’s going to win this tournament many times, not just once, and I just hope I can win it before it starts. fight all of us, and we won’t stand a chance.
Zverev, despite his strong performance (and obvious relief) on Tuesday, is still a long way from winning his first Grand Slam singles title.  In the semi-finals he will face the winner of Tuesday’s second match: a night session between Djokovic and fifth seed Rafael Nadal, who has won the French Open a record 13 times.
“It’s not really easier from here,” said Zverev, still elated.  “But I’ve often said, I’m no longer 20 or 21;  I am 25.  I’m at the stage where I want to win, I’m also at the stage where I’m supposed to win.

As major league games become longer and slower, frustrating even dedicated fans – Miami Marlins manager Don Mattingly recently said that the sport “is sometimes unwatchable” – the Bananas focus squarely on pleasure.  For viewers like me, it’s the most watchable team in baseball.

Just like that, you weren’t in Cooperstown.  New York, more.  You were somewhere with the Royals in the early 1980s and you could be in serious trouble.
“He’s bringing my name, he’s bringing Jamie Quirk’s name – and he’s bringing your name,” Brett said, pointing to his former teammate, Willie Mays Aikens, across the table.
“And he brings up the name Vida Blue, and the name Jerry Martin, and the name Willie Wilson.  And he said, ‘You know, we had a meeting earlier to call bookmakers and betting games. Let’s just say George and Jamie call a guy we’ve been bugged on…’”

Daily Mail: Russia cuts off Denmark's gas – the 5th European country Moscow has refused to supply- amid fears heating prices will soar even FURTHER 
* Danish firm Orsted said Gazprom would cut supplies to Denmark on June 1 
* Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and The Netherlands have also seen supplies cut 
* Russia is turning off the taps in response to Western sanctions over Ukraine war 
* Orsted had anticipated Moscow's move by filling up its storage facilities 
* The announcements follow Monday's agreement by European Union leaders to cut the European Union's imports of Russian oil by 90 percent by year-end 
Danish energy company Orsted said Tuesday that Russian gas company Gazprom Export would cut gas supplies to Denmark on June 1 after the Danish company refused to pay in rubles. 
Orsted, formerly DONG Energy, said Gazprom Export had informed it that its gas supply would be halted at 6:00 am (0400 GMT).  Russia has said it will only accept payment for natural gas deliveries in its national currency, with buyers required to set up ruble accounts or have their taps turned off.

But a few days spent reading the Israeli press and engaging in political conversations dispels that illusion.  There are too many similarities between Israeli and American politics.

In Israel as in the United States, the opposing forces are deeply divided and the majority of the current government is hanging by a thread.  In both countries, various coalitions are held together by mistrust and hatred on the other side.  Right-wing forces are campaigning tirelessly against the threat of an undifferentiated “left” while the center and the far left fear the return to …]]></summary>

    The Friends of the Easthampton Dog Park Board of Directors would like to thank everyone who stopped by to show their support earlier this month for our first dog park fundraiser here in Easthampton. 
The sun stayed behind the clouds, keeping it comfortable for all.  The dogs were all well behaved and especially appreciated the free treats and fresh water provided.  We raised $285 with additional funds that Furs a Flying will generously donate to us for all the nail clippings they did last week. 
Twenty-seven people also join our mailing list of more than 80 people to receive updates on our progress in securing a site for the park.  For more information, please email: easthamptondogpark@gmail.com.  Hope to see you at our next event.

Admiral Fagan, who was previously the service’s second-in-command, graduated from the Coast Guard Academy in 1985, in only the sixth class that included women.  She steadily rose through the ranks, serving at sea on an icebreaker and ashore as a Marine Safety Officer.
It wasn’t until much later in her career that she thought becoming a commander might even be possible.
“A lot of people were like, ‘Oh yeah, I knew she was going to be Admiral,’ but I didn’t think about it,” Admiral Fagan recalled.  “Even when I was first selected as Admiral, you don’t think about it, and…]]></summary>

It was the product of delicate coalition politics — more than 120 meetings over more than 100 hours, according to the White House.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Guardian: What’s next for Ukraine after Russia’s Donbas offensive?  
Analysis: Indiscriminate tactics of Russia’s grinding progress in east could characterise next phase of war 
The recent Russian advances in the Donbas lead to an inevitable question: whether the indiscriminate tactics the Kremlin deployed there will be a template for future offensives. 
With reports of large numbers of troops, artillery and rocket launchers mustering across the border near the Russian city of Kursk – in an area that borders Ukraine’s Sumy province – it is an urgent issue. 
While much has been made of the painfully slow and grinding pace of Russia’s recent offensive in the Donbas, the speed of territorial gains is not the only metric.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Ukraine's options are limited, and the reports that I am hearing from Ukrainians that know on what is happening in this war are distressing. 
So what is next for Ukraine? 
There is going to be no let-up in the war. After Donbas Russian forces will be focused on the city of Zaporizhhia (see the above map),  and after that the city of Dnipro. 
This is open country, and ideal terrain for Russian forces to do what they have always been trained to do. Conduct operations that isolate enemy units, and then destroy them with artillery. 
On another sad note. This region and the Donbas has always been the industrial heartland of Ukraine. Its loss will be incalculable for Ukraine, and the Kremlin knows it.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-05-31T23:00:00.062Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: General Milley tries to give the impression in this interview that the U.S. is not really involved in the Russia - Ukraine war. That the U.S. is an outside power observing the situation. A neutral party. Even saying that this conflict may end up as a stalemate, and if not, be ready to step up to make sure it does not escalate. 
I am not buying anything that the General is trying to sell. 
General Milley knows exactly what is going on in Ukraine right now. After receiving billions in US arms  the Donbas is turning into a disaster for the Ukraine military, and the only thing that the Pentagon can advise right now is to send even more arms into that conflict, thereby escalating it even further.
 Update: A regular clock is right two times a day .... With food crisis looming, Milley says using military to end Russian blockade would be ‘high risk’ (Defense News).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Russia hits back at the EU’s partial oil embargo, says it will find other importers for its crude 
* The European Union on Monday agreed to ban most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of new measures designed to punish the Kremlin over its invasion of Ukraine. 
* Responding to the measures, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, said the oil ban reflects negatively on the bloc. 
* “As she rightly said yesterday, #Russia will find other importers,” Ulyanov said via Twitter, referring specifically to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 
Moscow has pledged to find other importers for its oil shortly after the world’s largest trading bloc agreed to impose a partial embargo on Russian crude. 
The European Union on Monday decided to ban most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of new measures designed to punish the Kremlin over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. 
The move was hailed by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as a “landmark decision to cripple [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s war machine.”

Update: Moscow Shrugs Off EU Oil Ban: 'Russia Will Find Other Importers' (Zero Hedge/Epoch Times) 
WNU Editor: Russia will find other customers for its oil. The commodity is vital to the global economy, and there are shortages. 
The problem for Russia is that it will take time to find new customers for its oil, and Russian oil companies will then need to make arrangements with other customers on how to be paid. 
But as difficult as this will be for Russia, the EU will be impacted even more. They will need to find new suppliers, and it will definitely be more costlier because this new oil will need to be delivered by tanker rather than a pipeline. And even that is not a guarantee. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are saying very bluntly that their production capacity is almost at its limit .... Oil Prices Tumble On OPEC-Russia Reports (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>

The Taliban's control of Afghanistan is guaranteeing the "continued personal survival" of Al Qaeda, an expert has claimed, with a United Nations report supporting the claims.

The UN says Al Qaeda is using the takeover to increase their numbers and funding, as well as to "inspire Al Qaeda affiliates globally."

Crazy, exuberant and rightly angry, Vélez Meléndez’s play borrows from European absurd theatre, like the plays of Jarry and Genet, as well as from a tradition of Latin American surrealism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]     The big day is fast approaching for a 16-strong team of students taking the MBA programme at City University of Hong Kong’s College of Business.   On May 30 from 7-9pm, after close to eight months planning and preparation, they will be hosting a high-profile online event featuring senior figures connected to the world of fashion.   Fellow CityU students, along with design professionals, environmentalists and interested members of the public will be able to sign in free on various social media channels to hear invited speakers discuss the topic “From Fashion Conscious to Fashion Conscience”, focusing on what the industry must do to build a more sustainable future.   Pulling everything together has been a major organisational challenge, which was exactly the intention.     That’s because this SHARP Forum, as it’s billed, is one of a series of four, with each overseen by a different group within the MBA class. The other three are focusing on sustainable finance, green building and artificial meats. And, as the key element in a compulsory credit-bearing course, each event is specifically intended to provide practical, experiential learning by exposing the students to wide range of issues - some foreseeable, others unexpected - for which solutions must be found.       The two MCs on Monday night will be Mirjam Wong, otherwise a regional IT project manager with a leading global cosmetics company, and Adrian Chong, who since last September has been policy manager for an international accountancy association.     Understandably at this stage, both are feeling a few butterflies. But those should be calmed after the last few rehearsals and technical run-throughs and by knowing they have a strong line-up of speakers, a topical subject, and back-ups just in case of the odd glitch.   “Even when you plan as well as possible, something will go wrong on the day, especially when technology is involved,” says Wong, who also served as the research coordinator. “But you have to be ready…]]></summary>

Reuters: EU fails to agree Russian oil ban despite onslaught on outskirts of Sievierodonetsk 
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian and Russian forces battled on Monday on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, the last city still held by Kyiv in Ukraine's Luhansk province and the focus of Moscow's offensive in the country's east. 
But even as the Russian onslaught raged, EU leaders made clear they would fail to agree on a Russian oil import ban at a summit in Brussels, prompting swift criticism from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy who said they were too soft on Moscow. 
Russian shelling has reduced much of Sievierodonetsk to ruins, but the Ukrainian defence has slowed the wider Russian campaign across the Donbas region.

   Zero Hedge: Greece Alerts Its Tankers In Gulf After Iran Threatens More 'Retaliation' Seizures 
The government of Greece has issued an alert warning all Greek ships currently sailing in Persian Gulf waters to adapt and remain aware of heightened threats against them following last week's seizure of two Greek oil tankers by Iran's military.

TAIPEI, May 30 (Reuters) - Taiwan on Monday reported the largest incursion since January by China's air force in its air defence zone, with the island's defence ministry saying Taiwanese fighters scrambled to warn away 30 aircraft in the latest uptick in tensions. 
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained for the past two years or so of repeated missions by China's air force near the democratically governed island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone, or ADIZ, close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. 
Taiwan calls China's repeated nearby military activities "grey zone" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwan's forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test Taiwan's responses. 
The latest Chinese mission included 22 fighters, as well as electronic warfare, early warning and antisubmarine aircraft, the Taiwan ministry said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What seemed like an easy and sure win turned into one of the most spectacular finishes in recent memory, as Marcus Ericsson held on after a late restart to win the 106th Indianapolis 500.
With five laps to go, Ericsson, a 31-year-old Swedish driver, held a nearly three-second lead over Pato O’Ward, the 23-year-old Mexican driver for Arrow McLaren SP.  But a late crash by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion competing in his first Indianapolis 500, brought out a red flag that stopped the race with four laps remaining.
In a two-lap shootout after the restart, Ericsson veered left and right to disrupt the slipstream and repel an intense charge from O’Ward to take the checkered flag.
“I knew the car was pretty fast, but it was still tough,” Ericsson told NBC after the race…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple (XRP) has announced a $100 million investment in the carbon trading segment, CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Cointelegraph’s Joseph Hall in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting, which ended Thursday. 
Garlinghouse noted the growing profile of the cryptocurrency at the international summit, comparing his experiences over the past few years.  “As leaders around the world learn how these technologies can really benefit their constituents, benefit their economies, they are going to use them. […] I think we see that happening every day,” Garlinghouse said.
He went on to say that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are “underappreciated, despite the fact that there is obviously a lot of hype in some parts of the NFT market.”  Specifically:

“The tokenization of various assets is underestimated.” 

Garlinghouse cited the trade in carbon credits, which is often “challenged” by fraudulent activities, such as a use case for tokenization thanks to its transparency and traceability.  “It could really revolutionize carbon credit markets, the efficiency of carbon credit markets,” Garlinghouse said.  Ripple is investing $100 million in the segment, he added.

Cryptocurrency will have real-world use cases in 2022, Garlinghouse continued.  Cross-border transactions are an example that Ripple is working on.  Currently, cross-border transactions are “generally quite slow, quite expensive, and frankly very error-prone,” while the XRP blockchain has been “a very efficient and inexpensive bridge,” he said.
“I don’t think we live in a one-channel world,” Garlinghouse said.  “It’s a multi-channel world, there will be a lot of different utility use cases.”  Ripple will continue to focus on businesses, but other cryptocurrency foundations are also looking at consumer use cases, he explained.

Modified: 05/27/2022 11:56:58 AM



I am appalled at MaskChoice Northampton’s continued disrespect for the health and safety of our community.  The recent guest column in the Gazette (“A Call for Optional Masking in Schools,” May 21) is another ill-informed screed against masking that could have kept our students safe had the mask mandate remained in place. square.
Scores of Northampton students, staff and families have fallen ill after the mask mandate was removed.  That’s why the warrant was returned.  You had your say and the masks were removed to the detriment of more than a hundred high school students alone.
MaskChoice Northampton is not a choice.  This reflects a common care deficit for your wider community, those who are vulnerable and those who are not.  A speech-language pathologist is not a pediatric care provider or medical professional.  Few of our city’s pediatricians or public health providers agree with your short-sighted desire to rekindle the outbreak of disease that always follows mandatory mask removal. 
I can only hope you don’t succeed in your quest to put children and families at risk, including my own student who ultimately experienced a case of COVID after being exposed by an official count more than 20 times at the high school despite wearing his mask.
I wish you and your families good health and safety at school.  The safety that is in place for the rest of us finally due to the renewal of the mask mandate in place at Northampton Public Schools.

After anxiously waiting for six years, they decided to file a complaint.

Ukrainian soldiers yesterday launched a counteroffensive in Kherson, the key city that Russia has used as a staging base for its operations in southern Ukraine.  Ukrainian forces attempted to delay Russian efforts to conquer and cut off a strategic swath of eastern Ukraine. Follow the latest war updates.
The announcement of the Ukrainian counter-offensive – “Wait, Kherson, we are coming!”  the military said yesterday morning on Twitter – signaled what could turn out to be a new chapter in a war that has geopolitical, economic and humanitarian significance.

The break between hauntings might not give our heroes much time to catch their collective breath, but three years is a generally long interval between seasons, especially for a serialized show as dense with supernatural mythology, set relationships, and open-ended questions as “Stranger Things.”  If you don’t have 449 minutes to sp…]]></summary>

Dr. Subhash Kapila, Eurasian Review: Pakistan On Brink Of Civil War As Ousted PM Khan Weaponizes ‘Street Power’ – OpEd 
 Pakistan today in May 2022 tethers on the brink of a Civil War being generated by Constitutionally ousted former PM Iman Khan whose megalomaniacal impulses prompt him to challenge both the Constitution of Pakistan and the Pakistan Army by weaponizing “Street Power” in a bid to return to power in Islamabad – and raising grave implications for Pakistan and South Asia. 
Pakistan today is witnessing a clash of narratives wherein saner voices within Pakistan are voicing alarm on the irreparable damage that can be inflicted by ousted PM Imran Khan with his ‘Disruptive Strategy’ of weaponising ‘street power’ and Pakistan’s politically immature younger generation mesmerised by Imran Khan’s flamboyance providing the huge turnouts at Imran Khan’s ‘Jalsas’ and now the Long March already in Islamabad precincts.

Bogota (CNN)Colombia's presidential election appears destined for a runoff, after preliminary results on Sunday showed no candidate had garnered over 50% of the votes. 
With 98% of the votes counted, early results showed left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro with just over 40% of the votes, the populist former mayor of Bucaramanga Rodolfo Hernandez with 28%, and right-wing candidate Federico "Fico" Gutierrez with 23%. 
Petro and Hernandez are now expected to face each other during a second round of voting on June 19th.

WNU editor: My friend who follows Colombian politics very closely tells me that the second round of voting is going to be close, but the odds favour left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro to win with about 51% - 52% of the vote. My gut tells me that it is 50 - 50 right now.
