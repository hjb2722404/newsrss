        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: US Navy’s Newest Submarine Leaves Pentagon Baffled on When It Will Be Ready 
Officials overseeing development of the US Navy’s next-generation submarine to carry nuclear missiles don’t have the information they need to know whether the first vessel in the $132 billion Columbia program can deploy on time in 2031, an unreleased congressional audit found. 
Navy and Pentagon officials “have not obtained the schedule data and statistical information needed to confidently determine the likelihood that the shipbuilders can accomplish it as planned,” the Government Accountability Office said in the report, which was delivered in September but hasn’t been made public. 
The 12-ship Columbia class is set to replace the current fleet of 14 Ohio class ballistic-missile submarines. It’s envisioned as a key component of the US nuclear deterrence strategy into the late 21st century, complementing intercontinental ballistic missiles and air-launched weapons in the nation’s nuclear triad. 
The first ship is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost $15 billion in 2022 dollars, one of the costliest US weapons systems ever.

EU Observer: Germany 'shocks' allies by withholding Ukraine tanks 
Accusations of Russia appeasement have redoubled following Germany's decision to continue withholding tanks from Ukraine. 
German defence minister Boris Pistorius defended Berlin's decision following a Western arms-pledging meeting by 54 countries at the Rammstein military base in Germany on Friday (20 January). 
"There was no unified opinion on this," he told press, referring to Kyiv's call for Germany to deliver Leopard 2-class tanks to the battlefields of Ukraine. 
"The impression that sometimes arises that there is a united coalition and Germany is standing in the way is wrong," he added. 
"There are many allies who say: 'We share the view you've set out here. There are good reasons for delivering [the Leopards] and good reasons against it'," Pistorius said.

Reuters: Colombia, ELN Rebels to Resume Peace Talks in Mexico in February 
CARACAS (Reuters) - Colombia and the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group said on Saturday they will resume peace talks in Mexico next month, overcoming a recent impasse after the government recently declared and then called off a bilateral ceasefire. 
There was a first cycle of talks last year in Caracas to end the guerrillas' part in nearly six decades of war.  The about-face on the ceasefire came after ELN said it had not agreed to it. The government blamed a misunderstanding of the ELN's position. 
Both sides held an emergency meeting in Caracas this week and agreed to hold the second round of negotiations on Feb. 13 in Mexico, one of the guarantor nations for the talks along with Norway, Venezuela, Cuba and Chile.

A multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract has been awarded by the US Department of Defense to IAI to develop and deliver the new hybrid electro-optically-guided missile 
IAI has unveiled its POINT BLANK electro-optically guided missile, that can be carried in a soldier’s backpack. The system answers the battlefield requirement to provide tactical units ranging in size from small tactical teams to battalion level, with an independent and organic capability to increase their lethality. 
POINT BLANK allows these units to attack a variety of targets in real time with great precision and high lethality, without the need for support. The missile is hand-launched, operated by a single soldier, and can take off from and land vertically back to, the soldier’s hand.

Politico:  Time to join NATO? Moldova eyes joining ‘a larger alliance’  
President Maia Sandu tells POLITICO a ‘serious discussion’ is taking place about locking into a broader military alliance. 
DAVOS, Switzerland — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is prompting soul-searching in neighboring Moldova about whether the country needs to shift away from its constitutionally-enshrined neutrality and lock itself into a “larger alliance.”

“Now, there is a serious discussion … about our capacity to defend ourselves, whether we can do it ourselves, or whether we should be part of a larger alliance,” she said. “And if we come, at some point, to the conclusion as a nation that we need to change neutrality, this should happen through a democratic process.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moon of Alabama: Ukraine - Russian Army Activates Southern Front 
The long expected Russian offensive in Ukraine has begun. 
The Ukrainian army, egged on by its U.S. controllers, had put most of its resource into the static defense of the Bakhmut (Artyomovsk) - Soledar sector of the eastern front. An insane number of Ukrainian brigades, though many partially depleted, were concentrated on that 50 kilometer long front. This left other sectors nearly empty of Ukrainian troops.       
I count the equivalent of some 27 brigade size formations in that area. The usual size of a brigade is some 3,000 to 4,000 men with hundreds of all kinds of vehicles. If all brigades had their full strength that force would count as 97,500 men. In a recent interview the Ukrainian military commander Zaluzhny said that his army has 200,000 men trained to fight with 500,000 more having other functions or currently being trained. The forces which are currently getting mauled in the Bakhmut area constitute 50% of Ukraine's battle ready forces. 
On the southern and northern sectors of the battle-line the Ukrainian forces have been thinned out and are only able to defend against minor forces.

Update: Fighting on Ukraine southern front 'sharply' increases (AFP).   
WNU Editor: I expect Ukraine will be launching a counter offensive in the next day or two. But if not, it will be a signal to the Russian military, and to those who are watching the war very closely, that reports that Ukraine's military is severely depleted are true.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: US intelligence claims Russia has suffered a staggering 188,000 casualties in Ukraine and lost more than 2,000 tanks since Putin's bloody invasion began less than a year ago 
* Ukraine is bracing for a three-pronged attack from Russia within weeks 
* This is a significant increase to the estimated figure of 100,000 soldiers 
* Russia last week took Soledar, a mining town in the Donbas, in a bitter campaign 
American intelligence sources have claimed Russian casualties in Ukraine have reached a staggering 188,000 as Vladimir Putin's bloody invasion continues to backfire. 
The figure is a significant increase to the estimation of 100,000 Russian soldiers who were wounded, deserted and killed when outlined by UK’s Defence Secretary Ben Wallace at the end of 2022. 
It is also thought that the Ukrainians have captured or destroyed approximately 2,000 Russian tanks since the invasion, which happened less than a year ago.

The massive losses the Ukrainian army is incurring against Russia in Bakhmut has alarmed Germany’s foreign intelligence service (BND), according to the German newspaper Der Spiegel. 
For months, the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has been the site of fierce conflict. The fighting has intensified recently, but Ukraine claims its forces are holding out against the Russians, who recently said they had taken control of the nearby salt mining town of Soledar. 
In a closed-door meeting this week, the BND informed the members of the Bundestag (German federal parliament) that the Ukrainian army is currently losing a “three-digit number of soldiers” daily in combat with the Russian invaders. 
“The Ukrainians are currently suffering huge losses near Bakhmut. The BND briefing informs about “three-digit numbers of casualties per day,” the report said.

Bloomberg: Germany Allows Ukraine ‘Preparatory’ Training on Leopard Tanks 
Germany hasn’t made a decision to allow the sending of Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine, but will allow other countries to train Ukrainian soldiers on the vehicles.
“Germany won’t stand in the way if other states act like us, especially with regard to the possible preparatory training on these tanks,” new defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said Friday after a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at the US airbase in Ramstein. 
The step to allow training doesn’t “pre-conclude” any possible decision on provision of the German-made tanks, Pistorius said. 
“But we are preparing ourselves for every possible case.”  At the same time, he stressed that a request by some countries to send Leopards to Ukraine wasn’t discussed at the Ramstein meeting.

WNU Editor: The pressure is being put on Germany to deliver their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. But this is probably the reason why Germany is reluctant to send their tanks (see tweet below).

The Bundeswehr is actually naked! We are expected to have a severe shortage of weapons by 2025 due to the energy crisis. It is simply unprofitable for factories to sell weapons at the same prices!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First Post: Stryker combat vehicles, Patriot missiles, Challenger 2 tanks and more: A breakdown of military aid promised to Ukraine 
It’s almost a year since the Russia-Ukraine war began and Kyiv has been provided with military equipment by more than 30 countries. The US has announced a new package that includes armoured vehicles such as the Stryker and Bradley, and others too have also made valuable contributions 
It’s Day 331 of the Russia-Ukraine war (yes, it started back in February 2022) and the United States on Friday announced a military package valued at $2.5 billion for Kyiv. The military aid includes 90 Stryker combat vehicles and an additional 59 Bradley fighting vehicles to Ukraine, in addition to hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, the Pentagon said. 
Interestingly, the aid has been announced just hours before a critical meeting will be held at the Ramstein military base in Germany this evening to discuss the next steps in the defence of Ukraine and ways to fend off Russian aggression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: All eyes are on the borderlands of Russia and Ukraine... but life hasn't stopped elsewhere with global powers circling over civil wars still raging in the Middle East, writes author and producer ERBIL GUNASTI 
 * Middle-ranking powers such as India and Turkey have not taken sides in Ukraine 
* Battles elsewhere will not remain frozen just because America is preoccupied 
All eyes are on the borderlands of Russia and Ukraine. All Western eyes, that is.  And understandably so. The consequences of the Russian invasion have been huge, not least when it comes to energy prices. 
If the West is preoccupied, however, that doesn’t mean the rest of the world has ground to a halt. 
Life hasn’t stopped just because NATO and Moscow are locked in conflict.  Other countries have their own problems to face – pressing ones. And it should be no surprise that a range of middle-ranking powers, including India, Turkey and South Africa have refused to take sides. 
The vicious civil war in the Yemen, the fighting in the Horn of Africa, the perpetual conflicts in the Middle East – all these are continuing, even if the Western media has turned its gaze elsewhere. 
These battles will not remain frozen just because America is preoccupied. And it is a mistake to ignore them because the various outcomes will help shape the future for all of us.

CNN: Taiwan to allow women into military reserve force training as China fears grow 
Hong Kong CNN  — Taiwan’s military on Tuesday rolled out plans to allow women to volunteer for reserve force training for the first time, as China continues to ramp up military pressure on the democratic self-ruled island. 
The Taiwanese Defense Ministry said it will allow 220 discharged female soldiers to enroll in the training starting from the second quarter of this year. 
Maj. Gen. Yu Wen-cheng, from the ministry’s All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency, said the move would be on a trial basis for this year.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry has previously said it only trained male reservists because it did not have sufficient capacity to accommodate both sexes.

WASHINGTON — Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff who has steered President Biden’s administration through two years of triumphs and setbacks, is expected to step down in coming weeks in the most significant changing of the guard since Mr. Biden took office two years ago. 
Mr. Klain has been telling colleagues privately since the November midterm elections that after a grueling, nonstop stretch at Mr. Biden’s side going back to the 2020 campaign, he is ready to move on, according to senior administration officials, and a search for a replacement has been underway.

WASHINGTON — The billions of dollars in new arms for Ukraine announced this month — including British tanks, American fighting vehicles and howitzers from Denmark and Sweden — are testament to President Vladimir V.

        <updated>2023-01-21T13:00:00.052Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gen. Mark Milley during a press conference at the US Air Base in Ramstein, Germany, on January 20, 2023.Andre Pain   
Business Insider: Top US general says Ukraine war has become an 'absolute catastrophe' for Russia, estimating it's suffered 'significantly well over' 100,000 casualties 
* Milley on Friday said Russia has suffered "significantly well over" 100,000 casualties in Ukraine. 
* This marked a slight update from a figure Milley offered in November. 
* Milley urged Putin to end the war, saying it had become an "absolute catastrophe" for Moscow. 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley on Friday said that Russia has "really suffered a lot" in Ukraine and urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war. 
"The Russian casualties — last time I reported out on it publicly, I said it was well over 100,000. I would say it's significantly well over 100,000 now," Milley said at a news conference alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Germany, providing a slight update on a figure the top US general offered in November. 
Milley said that the "tremendous amount of casualties" suffered by Russia included "regular military, and also their mercenaries in the Wagner Group and other type forces that are fighting with the Russians."   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: Gen. Mark Milley has been saying the same thing since the start of the war last year. That Russia was going to run out of missiles and ammo. That Russia could not sustain the war. That Russia's military has in essence been gutted. And here we are right now seeing him and other NATO Generals and Defense officials gathering together to scramble ammo and equipment for Ukraine to replace what has been lost and to get Ukraine ready to face what is expected to be a massive Russian offensive in the coming weeks. 
Needless to say. This is same General who admitted publicly that he was clueless on Afghanistan .... ‘Nothing I saw indicated a collapse of this government in 11 days’: Milley on Afghanistan (NYPost).]]></summary>

No Leopard tanks will be given to Ukraine by Germany at this time, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark A. Milley said on Friday, at a briefing at Germany's U.S. Ramstein Air Base following an international conference on Ukraine support. 
The international meeting comes amid Kyiv's frustration with the dissent over sending tanks to Ukraine as the full-scale invasion reaches the 11-month mark. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made direct pleas for tanks at the meeting. 
Later Friday, in his evening address, Zelenskyy said Ukraine will have to fight to secure a supply of modern heavy armor.  "Every day we make it more obvious that there is no alternative to taking a decision about tanks," he said.

CNN: US to designate Russia’s Wagner mercenary group as a ‘transnational criminal organization’ 
The US Treasury Department will designate the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group as a “transnational criminal organization” and will impose additional sanctions next week against the group and its support network across the world, the White House said on Friday.
“These actions recognize the transcontinental threat that Wagner poses, including through its ongoing pattern of serious criminal activity,” National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told reporters on Friday, ahead of the Treasury Department announcement. 
Along with the new sanctions, the US has released newly declassified photos of Russian railcars traveling from Russia to North Korea and back in November, in what the US believes was the initial delivery of infantry rockets and missiles for use by the mercenary organization Wagner Group in Ukraine.

Military.com: The Army Forced to Change the Name of Its New Rifle 
The Army is changing the name of its new rifle after accidentally taking a name from an unrelated existing weapon, the service announced Wednesday. 
The service's upcoming M5 from Sig Sauer will now be called the M7 after it was discovered Colt Industries also makes a weapon called the M5. The light machine gun set to replace the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, or SAW, the M250, will not change. 
"The Army originally chose the designation XM5 as the name of the new rifle in March," a service spokesperson said in a statement. "Since then, the service learned that the M5 name is used by Colt Industries for one of its 5.56mm carbines."

Update: New name selected for Army’s Next Generation Squad Weapon (Army Times)   
WNU Editor: This is something that I did not know. This new rifle is currently called the XM7. The “X” used in the weapon nomenclature is to distinguish it as a weapon not yet fielded. Once fielded the firearm will drop the “X.”]]></summary>

Tank space in the city state is being snapped up due to a rise in interest and profits from mixing cheap fuel supplies from Russia with shipments from other sources, according to an executive from a tank operator and a consultant who advises traders on the matter. That process can help to obscure the cargoes’ origins, they said. 
Singapore hasn’t banned the import of Russian oil or petroleum products, although financial institutions based in the island state are prohibited from financing or dealing with Russian goods and companies. Singapore government agencies referred to past statements on the ban and price cap policy, without additional comments.

Daily Dot: EXCLUSIVE: U.S. airline accidentally exposes ‘No Fly List’ on unsecured server 
One of the most sensitive U.S. government documents was left online. 
An unsecured server discovered by a security researcher last week contained the identities of hundreds of thousands of individuals from the U.S. government’s Terrorist Screening Database and “No Fly List.” 
Located by the Swiss hacker known as maia arson crimew, the server, run by the U.S. national airline CommuteAir, was left exposed on the public internet. It revealed a vast amount of company data, including private information on almost 1,000 CommuteAir employees. 
Analysis of the server resulted in the discovery of a text file named “NoFly.csv,” a reference to the subset of individuals in the Terrorist Screening Database who have been barred from air travel due to having suspected or known ties to terrorist organizations. 
The list, according to crimew, appeared to have more than 1.5 million entries in total. The data included names as well as birth dates. It also included multiple aliases, placing the number of unique individuals at far less than 1.5 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The streets of France filled with outraged workers on Thursday as rail employees, teachers, and others walked off the job to protest President Emmanuel Macron's deeply unpopular plan to overhaul the nation's pension system by raising the official retirement age from 62 to 64.
The union-led demonstrations—which ground significant portions of the country, including many schools and transportation systems, to a halt—come as Macron is attempting to steamroll far-reaching opposition to his pension overhaul, declaring that "we must work longer."
Macron's government formally presented its draft law last week, the first step in the process of enacting a reform that would force French citizens to work longer to qualify for a full pension.

"I had no food. There was only a bottle of ketchup that was on the boat, garlic powder and (bouillon cubes) Maggi. So I mixed it up with some water for me to survive 24 days in the sea," Elvis Francois, 47, said in English in a video released by the Colombian Navy.
The islander had the word "help" carved on the hull of the boat when he was found 120 nautical miles northwest of Puerto Bolivar in the northern department of La Guajira.
Francois said he saw other boats pass by and tried to flag them down, even lighting a fire on his vessel, but they did not see him.

The Dutch National Archive unveiled the hand-drawn map in early January, featuring a tell-tale red 'X' believed to mark the spot where German soldiers stashed their hoard.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Thursday's shock resignation of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who altered the face of global politics when she was elected the world's youngest female head of state, throws a spotlight on the punishing demands faced by women in power.
Holding back tears as she made her declaration, the 42-year-old politician said she had next to nothing left "in the tank" and it was time to step aside after a challenging 5-1/2 years in office.
"Politicians are human," she said. "We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it's time. And for me, it's time."
But the remarks that followed were more revealing, said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of politics at New Zealand's University of Canterbury.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday made a shock announcement she had "no more in the tank" to continue leading the country and would step down no later than early February and not seek re-election.
Ardern, holding back tears, said that it had been a tough five and a half years as prime minister and that she was only human and needed to step aside.
"This summer, I had hoped to find a way to prepare for not just another year, but another term - because that is what this year requires. I have not been able to do that," Ardern, 42, told a news conference.
"I know there will be much discussion in the aftermath of this decision as to what the so called 'real' reason was... The only interesting angle you will find is that after going on si…]]></summary>

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Messina Denaro, a brutal Sicilian Mafia boss who was Italy's most wanted criminal before his capture on Monday, had been on the run for 30 years. Here are some key facts about his arrest and what it means:
WHY IS THE ARREST SO IMPORTANT?
Messina Denaro, 60, was the last runaway member of a generation of mobsters who masterminded a string of bombings and murders that terrorised Italy in the early 1990s.
His arrest finally brings closure to that dark era, shatters a symbol of resistance to the Italian state and could reveal Mafia secrets in the unlikely event that Messina Denaro agrees to talk to investigators.
He was involved in dozens of killings, including of top prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the adolescent son of a Mafia…]]></summary>

Ukraine has repeatedly pushed for modern Western tanks to help battle Russia's invasion, and Germany has reportedly linked its decision on whether to do so to Washington's willingness to provide Abrams.
"I just don't think we're there yet," US Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told journalists when asked about providing Abrams to Ukraine, though he did not completely close the door on a shift in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.
Just days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.
He ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was "convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors."
In a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil's presidents live.
Leftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.
As he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.

The president said last week that any "radical bolsonarista" found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.
"How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?" asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.
Bolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula's inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.
He has denied any link to the riots.
In a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed "regret" over the events, which he described as "unbelievable".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notorious drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman has appealed to Mexico's president for help due to alleged "psychological torment" he is suffering in a US prison, his lawyer said Tuesday.
"In the six years that Joaquin has been in the United States, he has not seen the sun," said Jose Refugio Rodriguez, a Mexico-based legal representative of the Sinaloa cartel founder.
The message, described as "an SOS," was transmitted via one of Guzman's lawyers in the United States as well as his family, Rodriguez said.
Guzman is only allowed outside three times a week to a small area where he "doesn't get the sun," and has fewer visits or phone calls than other inmates, the lawyer said in an interview with Radio Formula.
"He is suffering psychological torment," he said, adding that the lack of sunshine was also bad for the convicted drug trafficker's physical health.
Guzman wants President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to address alleged procedural violations during his extradition in 2017 under the former government, Rodriguez added.
The Mexican embassy in Washington confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday that it received an email from Rodríguez on January 10. 
Without referring to the content of the email, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard downplayed the chance of any government intercession in favor of the notorious drug trafficker. 
"He is serving a sentence there, he has a sentence," he told journalists. "So, frankly I don't see any possibilities for him, but I'm going to review it with the prosecutor's office." 
El Chapo is serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted in 2019 of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and weapons-related offenses.
One of his sons, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested by Mexican security forces this month in an operation that left 29 people dead and sparked a dramatic shootout at an airport in the city of Culiacan.

Thunberg has been in Germany for several days to support protests against the demolition of Luetzerath, which have become a symbol of resistance against fossil fuels.
Images showed the activist, dressed in black, being picked up by police officers wearing helmets and then escorted to a waiting bus.
A police spokeswoman said a group of activists were in custody after having "broken away from the demonstration", and run towards the edge of an open pit.
Officials were working to identify the protesters in custody, and a decision would be made later about what further action to take, she said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France is to face severe public transport disruptions on Thursday, operators have warned, as workers join a nationwide strike against a widely unpopular pension reform plan.
The suggested changes, still to be debated in parliament, would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increase contributions required for a full pension.
The industrial action across different sectors on Thursday will be the first time in 12 years -- since that age was increased from 60 to 62 -- that all of France's unions are united.
"It'll be a hellish Thursday," Transport Minister Clement Beaune told broadcaster France 2 on Tuesday, urging all those who could to work from home.
Paris public transport operator RATP warned services would be diminished, with three metro lines out of service, and ten others only operating partially.
Services would continue as normal on just two automated lines, though they risked being overcrowded, it said.
Elsewhere in the country, national train operator SNCF said many high-speed trains would be out of action, with just one in five maintaining their journeys in some areas.
Most slow trains between cities would be halted.
Up to 70 percent of nursery and primary school teachers are also expected to refuse to work, the education ministry has said.
Opinion polls show that around two-thirds of French people oppose raising the retirement age, a move that comes amid high inflation and with the country still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
President Emmanuel Macron's last attempt at pension reform in 2019, aborted a year later when Covid-19 hit Europe, prompted the longest strike on the Paris transport network in three decades.
The 45-year-old centrist put the issue at the heart of his successful re-election campaign last year, pointing to forecasts that the system would fall into heavy deficit at the end of the decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world's population may have shot up beyond eight billion for the first time recently, but some countries including the most populous, China, are seeing their populations shrink.
And the decline is set to continue as factors including rising living costs, more women entering the workforce and having children later mean people in some countries are having fewer babies.
China's population shrank last year for the first time in more than six decades, official data showed Tuesday, and it is expected to be overtaken by India this year as the most populous nation.
Other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, can expect a demographic slump over the coming decades, according to UN figures published last July which forecast how the world's population will develop between now and 2100.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italy's National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault.
Accepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum "for having had 'le palle' (the balls) to invite me tonight", according to Deadline and Variety reports.
The museum, which also organized a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as "unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation".
Its "Stella della Mole" award was given to Spacey -- the star of Oscar-winning film "American Beauty" and drama series "House of Cards" -- for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi.
Spacey on Friday appeared via videolink in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offenses against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.
His stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offenses although he has not been convicted.
The actor was slapped with the fresh charges involving one man in November, taking the total number of charges he faces in the UK to 12.
Last summer he appeared at London's Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five charges of similar sexual offenses against three other men.
Now on unconditional bail, Spacey will face a four-week trial in London, starting June 6, which will consider all the charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, "deepfake" video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.
Cave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.
The chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.
The Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave's website, asked the tool to produce a song "in the style of Nick Cave".
One of the AI-created verses runs: "I'm the king of the abyss, I'm the ruler of the dark / I'm the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark."
"This song sucks," wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT's work "replication as travesty".
He followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn't, describing the process of writing as "an act of self-murder".
"Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don't feel," he wrote.
He added: "Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit."
Cave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- "I've got the fire of hell in my eyes."
"I have got the fire of hell in my eyes -- and it's ChatGPT," he concluded.
