These people sheltering within the hospital and its garden were heard as far away as Afghanistan yet totally ignored where it counted most- with the men in Israel's war cabinet and Washington; they were busy executing and aiding an illegal war of choice on an unarmed, defenseless hospital and one of the poorest and densely populated places in the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/11/22/35364">Read the full story, “The Cries of Gaza Reach Afghanistan”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance -- the largest crypto exchange in the world -- after he and the company pleaded guilty on Tuesday to sweeping US money laundering violations and agreed to fines of more than $4 billion.
Here are three of the highest-profile crypto executives who have fallen foul of the law since last year:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American cluster munitions 
Business Insider: The US says the cluster bombs it's giving Ukraine fail less than 3% of the time. Experience suggests the real number is far higher. 
* The United States is providing Ukraine with cluster bombs it says have a failure rate of 2.35%. 
* But past use suggests "failure rates of 10% to 30%," according to a report prepared for Congress. 
* Cluster bombs that fail to explode can pose a risk to civilians for decades to come. 
The US claim that the cluster bombs it's sending to Ukraine have a failure rate of less than 3% is unlikely to hold up under real-world conditions, with past use of the widely-banned weapon suggesting as many as 3 in 10 fail to explode. 
At a press conference on Friday announcing the transfer, Colin Kahl, US undersecretary of defense for policy, said that the "dud" rate for US-provided 155-millimeter DPICMs, or dual-purpose improved conventional munitions, is just 2.35%. He compared it to the alleged failure rate for Russian cluster munitions of 30-40%.

Opinion polls suggest the result is far too close to predict, with any of four candidates -- including one from the far-right -- within striking distance of power in the EU's fifth-largest economy.
The vote is being closely watched across Europe and further afield: the Netherlands tends to punch above its weight in the EU and on the world stage, with steadfast support for Ukraine and eurozone fiscal discipline.
Polls suggested huge numbers were undecided going into election day, making the result a literal coin-toss for one voter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chinese government has expanded its campaign of closing mosques to regions other than Xinjiang, where for years it has been blamed for persecuting Muslim minorities, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Wednesday.
Authorities have closed mosques in the northern Ningxia region as well as Gansu province, which are home to large populations of Hui Muslims, as part of a process known officially as “consolidation,” according to the report, which draws on public documents, satellite images and witness testimonies.
Local authorities also have been removing architectural features of mosques to make them look more “Chinese," part of a campaign by the ruling Communist Party to tighten control over religion and reduce the risk of possible challenges to its rule.
President Xi Jinping in 2016 called for the “Sinicization” of religions, initiating a crackdown that has largely concentrated on the western region of Xinjiang, home to more than 11 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.
Chinese authorities have decommissioned, closed down, demolished or converted mosques for secular use in regions outside Xinjiang as part of a campaign aimed at cracking down on religious expression, according to Human Rights Watch.
Additionally, the ablution hall of one mosque was damaged inside, according to videos obtained by the group.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World leaders on Wednesday welcomed a truce deal between Israel and Hamas that agreed a four-day halt to the devastating war in Gaza, accompanied by the release of dozens of hostages held by the militant group in return for Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The agreement marks the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since Hamas’s bloody cross-border October 7 attack on southern Israel that prompted Israel to launch a bombing campaign and ground offensive in Hamas-ruled Gaza.
Israel’s government and Hamas agreed to a four-day pause in fighting to allow the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The deal, which was brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US, came after five weeks of negotiations, according to a US official.
US President Joe Biden said late Tuesday he was deeply relieved that some hostages taken when Hamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7 will soon go free.
Qatar on Wednesday provided more details on the deal.]]></summary>

Several U.S. service members were injured in a ballistic missile attack by Iranian-backed militias on Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq, Pentagon officials said Tuesday. The attack Monday night on U.S. and coalition forces involved a close-range ballistic missile and resulted in eight injuries and minor infrastructural damage, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement. 
U.S. military responded with a retaliatory strike, which was not pre-planned, killing several Iranian-backed militia personnel, CBS News learned. 
"Immediately following the attack, a U.S. military AC-130 aircraft in the area conducted a self-defense strike against an Iranian-backed militia vehicle and a number of Iranian-backed militia personnel involved in this attack," Ryder said in his statement.

RT: Russian actress killed in Ukrainian rocket strike 
Kiev used US-supplied HIMARS to attack a concert in Donetsk, authorities have said 

Actor, choreographer, and director Polina Menshikh was mortally wounded in a Ukrainian rocket attack during a performance in Donetsk, her colleagues revealed on Tuesday. 
The strike reportedly used HIMARS systems supplied by the US to first bomb a charity concert Menshikh wa participating in and then target the first responders who came to help.

Menshikh, 40, was the head of the Lege Artis studio. 
She was in the town of Kumachovo, in the Starobeshevo district of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) on Sunday to perform at a concert for Russian troops. The performance was cut short, however, when a volley of HIMARS missiles struck the concert hall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Axios: Israel and Hamas agree to hostage deal, four-day pause in fighting in Gaza 
The Israeli government and Hamas announced separately on Tuesday they have agreed to a Qatar-mediated deal in which the militant group will free dozens of Israeli hostages in exchange for a four-day pause in fighting in Gaza and the release of dozens of Palestinians held in prisons in Israel.

 
Why it matters: The deal, once implemented, will be the biggest diplomatic breakthrough and the first major pause in fighting since the war began. 
Details: In the first phase of the two-phase deal, Hamas is expected to free at least 50 Israeli women and children held in Gaza, while Israel is expected to release about 150 Palestinian prisoners, mostly women and children over the four-day pause.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man who was convicted in the beating of a Jewish man in New York City back in 2021 yelled out "Free Palestine" inside a courtroom during his sentencing hearing, The New York Post reported. 
Mahmoud Musa, 23, was sentenced to seven years in prison in connection to the attack on Joseph Borgen which took place during a confrontation between supporters of Israel and Palestinian. 
ALSO READ: These 10 legislators have also broken a federal disclosure law, just like George Santos
As he was being led away in handcuffs, he yelled "Free Palestine," which sparked an uproar in the court room from his supporters, with some of them calling the judge a "racist." Musa's supporters were then escorted out of the courtroom by security, according to reports.
From The New York Post: "Borgen, who was wearing a yarmulke, was pepper-sprayed by a pack of men as they hurled antisemitic slurs at him while beating him in an attack captured on video that later went viral. He said he still suffers from post-traumatic-stress-disorder and wrist pain as a result of the attack, which left him with a concussion and other injuries."

A US military aircraft fired on a vehicle and killed hostile forces following an attack on US and coalition forces at Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq on Monday evening, a US official told CNN on Tuesday. 
It’s unclear how many hostiles were killed and whether US personnel were injured in the attack on Al-Asad. 
Two US officials said the US AC-130 gunship, which is capable of firing artillery at ground-based targets, was acting in defense. 
As of Monday afternoon, there had been at least 64 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, including several on forces at Al-Asad.

Beirut (AFP) – Lebanon's Hezbollah movement said it targeted troops in northern Israel with drones, artillery and missiles on Monday, claiming a string of new attacks. 
The Israel-Lebanon border has seen daily exchanges of fire since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7. 
Hezbollah fighters targeted soldiers west of Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel "with three attack drones", the Iran-backed group said in a statement, adding shortly after that it had also targeted troops in the area with artillery fire. 
Both statements claimed the attacks were "direct hits". 
Earlier Monday, Hezbollah said it had fired "Burkan missiles" at an Israeli barracks, and also claimed a number of other attacks on Israeli positions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare nugget of information about the famously enigmatic street art superstar Banksy emerged Tuesday when he gave his first name as "Robbie" in an unearthed 2003 BBC interview.
In the interview, one of the few known to exist with the global art phenomenon, he is asked if his name "Robert Banks", to which he replies: "It's Robbie."
His identity has long been the source of speculation, with some claiming his name was Robin or Robert Banks.
Banksy talks about his distinctive stencilling style in the interview, a podcast bonus part of a series called "The Banksy Story".
"It's quick... I want to get it done and dusted," he is heard to say of his work.
The artist was in his 20s at the time, and was promoting the opening of his "Turf War" show in east London.
The series also contains a 2005 interview the artist purportedly gave with US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR).
In it, the host asks: "We assume that you are who you say you are, but how can we be sure?" The interviewee responds: "Oh, you have no guarantee of that at all."
Banksy, known to hail from Bristol in southwest England, boasts an A-list client list and has sold his works for tens of millions of pounds at auction since achieving notoriety in the early 2000s.]]></summary>

The 16-year-old high school student, identified only as Thomas, was stabbed at the weekend when a group of outsiders descended on a festive crowd of around 400 people gathered in Crepol, in the southwestern Drome region, for a dance party in the village hall.
He died on his way to hospital. Eight others were injured, two of them seriously.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told parliament that seven people had been arrested and investigators would now ascertain if they were behind "this odious crime".

Politico.eu:  German defense minister announces €1.3B weapons package during visit to Kyiv

 
Germany said it will continue to stand with Ukraine, but still won’t provide Taurus missiles. 
KYIV — German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday bearing a much-needed gift: more military aid for Ukraine. 
"I have the honor to announce a new package," Pistorius said during a press conference in Kyiv. It includes another four systems of IRIS-T medium-range missiles, 155-millimeter ammunition, and Panzer anti-tank defense mines, he clarified. 
"Altogether it is a package worth €1.3 billion euros, and I am quite sure this will help you and your fight against Russian aggression. We stand with Ukraine reliably," Pistorius said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former South African Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius, who was convicted of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp a decade ago, is unlikely to be released immediately if he is granted parole on Friday, the victim's family lawyer said.
The country's parole board on Monday said it would be "considering the profile of Oscar Pistorius on Friday, 24 November 2023".
But even if Pistorius's application was to be successful the ex-athlete might have to wait for weeks before being let out of prison pending an "internal process" by the Department of Correctional Services (DCS), according to the Steenkamp family lawyer, Tania Koen.
If "parole is granted, DCS follows an internal process, which is usually within a month", Koen told AFP.
Several legal experts questioned by AFP said the time betwee…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korea has fired what it claims is a military spy satellite, the South's armed forces said Tuesday, hours after Japan confirmed that Pyongyang had warned it of an imminent launch.
North Korea's previous efforts to put a spy satellite into orbit in May and August both failed, and Seoul, Tokyo and Washington had repeatedly warned Pyongyang not to proceed with another launch, which would violate successive rounds of UN resolutions.
Seoul's military "detected at 10:43 pm (1343 GMT) one alleged military surveillance satellite launched from the Tongchang-ri area in North Pyongan province," South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
The rocket and its purported satellite payload "flew to the west of Baengnyeong island", it said, referring to an island near the maritime border between the two …]]></summary>

If Congress fails to move before the end of the year, Senate sources say, the chances of getting the entire plan over the finish line reduce dramatically. 
WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders are hoping to muster a supplemental package to aid the war efforts in Ukraine and Israel, as well as make improvements to the U.S. immigration system, by the end of the year, according to multiple people involved in discussions.

The U.S. on Monday released a new $100 million aid package for Ukraine, announcing more artillery rounds and anti-aircraft munitions as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made a surprise visit to Kyiv. 
The package includes 155 millimeter artillery shells, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, small arms ammunition and Javelin and AT-4 launchers. 
Austin said at a Monday press conference in Kyiv that the package will help Ukrainian troops in the coming months “have the means that they’ll need to be successful fighting in the wintertime.”

WNU Editor: This announcement is a joke. The war is costing Ukraine anywhere from $100 million to $200 million a day. So what US Secretary of Defense Austin is committing to is basically a promise to finance the war for about a day.

One of the proposed routes is nearly half a kilometer (over a quarter of a mile) long.
Still wearing their helmets, the men could be seen peering at the endoscopic camera sent by rescuers down a thin pipe through which air, food and water are being sent.
"We will bring you out safely, do not worry," rescuers were heard telling the trapped men as they gathered near the camera, in video released by state authorities.

MANILA: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos insisted his country would not give up "a single square inch of our territory", as Manila seeks to counter Beijing's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. 
The remarks were made at a forum in Hawaii on Sunday (Nov 19), and came days after Marcos met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in San Francisco where the pair discussed their countries' maritime territorial disputes. 
Marcos said the situation in the South China Sea had become "more dire than it was before", warning that China's military had "started to show interest" in building bases on reefs that were "closer and closer to the Philippine coastline".

"Today I toured the main quarters. It was a spectacular city; I say 'was' because today more than half has been consumed by fire," the French emperor wrote.
In the missive, on sale for $58,300, he also remarked on the city's inventory of alcohol.

SEOUL — North Korea launched a rocket on Tuesday in what South Korea said was an attempt to put its first military reconnaissance satellite in orbit, this time with technological help from Russia.
The rocket flew to the south over the sea between the Korean Peninsula and China, the South Korean military said in a brief statement. 
The United States, South Korea and Japan have all placed their militaries on alert to guard against such a launch, concerned that debris from the North’s rocket might fall on the Asian allies’ territories. They also want to collect intelligence on the rocket to determine the implications its satellite program may have on regional stability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus says the weapons found inside Al-Shifa Hospital prove Hamas uses hospitals for non-hospital purposes.

“We are going to prove by exposing the underground tunnels that we have started tapping into and by exploring the perimeter of the area and really getting into the deep underground of the hospital,” he told Sky News Australia.

“Then we will be able to prove that Hamas really uses this hospital as a command-and-control position.”

Lt Conricus forecasts the IDF will soon prove more as he claimed Hamas used the Al-Shifa Hospital on October 7 when they carried out terror attacks.

“We know the area is rife with Hamas operatives carrying weapons and patrolling the hospital.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 32 babies inside Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza were safely evacuated to southern Gaza as the medical centre was captured without a single Palestinian being wounded, says IDF Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus.

“They were evacuated through incubators which we, the IDF, provided – I know so because I was on the ground,” he told Sky News Australia. 

Lt Conricus also denied reports babies died from lack of oxygen due to electricity supplies being turned off. 

“There was a convoy of Red Crescent ambulances that made its way through a humanitarian corridor that we facilitated from Shifa in northern Gaza towards southern Gaza.

“And the report that I have, which was confirmed also with the Egyptians, is they have arrived safely at the hospital in southern Gaza – all the babies that left the Shifa Hospital.”]]></summary>

China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning has defended its ship which essentially emitted a sonar ping that injured an Australian navy diver last week.

Ms Ning has also accused the Albanese government of causing trouble over the incident following the Prime Minister's comments to Sky News Australia on Monday.

During the interview, Mr Albanese condemned the ship for acting dangerously or unprofessionally.

The Chinese newspaper the Global Times has also tried to muddy the waters by suggesting the HMAS Toowoomba had been sailing through disputed waters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who infamously peddled conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that were concocted by a woman who believes she can talk with the wind, is now floating wild conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19.
While there is still some debate over whether COVID-19 may have originated from a viral research lab in the city of Wuhan, Bartiromo on Monday took things several steps farther — and suggested that the virus was part of a deliberate plot to bring down former President Donald Trump.
During an interview with Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Bartiromo openly asked, "Is there a chance that China released this virus on America intentionally?"
In fact, there is no evidence of a Chinese plot to deliberately release a virus that spread all across the globe, not just in the United States, and that wound up killing millions of people, including an unquantified number of Chinese citizens.
ALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.
Regardless, Bartiromo went on to say that the goal of the Chinese government may have been to "disrupt" America to "get Donald Trump out, get your man in there, Joe Biden."
Wenstrup didn't explicitly endorse Bartiromo's theory, although he did leave open the possibility that the virus was released "accidentally."

The 30-year-old "jumped out of bed, and after a minute or two already he was wearing his uniform", Ohana said.
"I made him a coffee to take with him, and we kissed," Ohana said. "I told him not to be a hero."

Sputnik: US Troops Dispatched to Secure Israel's Top Secret Nuclear Facilities: Report 
 US officials have vacillated between denying the presence of American boots on the ground in Israel, and admitting that small numbers of commandos have been deployed to help search for hostages and advise their Israeli counterparts. 
US troops have reportedly been dispatched to help secure Israel’s highly sensitive nuclear facilities, including the top secret site at Dimona – the alleged birthplace of the Israeli’s suspected nuclear arsenal. 
Sources speaking to an independent online Arabic-language newspaper indicated that the US told a Lebanese intelligence intermediary that American troops “would not participate” in field operations in the Gaza Strip “under any circumstances,” but rather be deployed to “secure and protect” two Israeli research reactors, the Negev Nuclear Research Center near the city of Dimona, and a second facility in the desert near the locality of Yavne in central Israel.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
