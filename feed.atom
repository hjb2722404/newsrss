Insider: Greece warns another European war could be on the horizon as Turkey hints at the possibility of an invasion 
* Greece is calling on the EU, NATO, and the UN to condemn Turkey over recent threats. 
* Turkey's Erdogan has made veiled threats of an attack against Greece. 
* "When the time comes, we can come suddenly one night," Erdogan said on Tuesday. 
Greece is calling on its allies to condemn Turkey over recent aggressive rhetoric from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has hinted at the possibility of open conflict as tensions rise between the two countries. 
In letters dated Monday and Tuesday to NATO, the EU, and the UN that were reported on by the Associated Press, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias called for all three institutions to rebuke Ankara over Erdogan's comments. 
Dendias said that allowing Turkey to continue threatening Greece would run the risk of yet another conflict in Europe, in an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine.

DW: Ukraine reconstruction may cost $349 billion 
As the war in Ukraine goes on, the cost of rebuilding the country and its economy mounts up dramatically. A detailed new report puts a figure on the damage: more than one-third of a trillion US dollars. 
The cost of rebuilding Ukraine and its economy has already reached at least $349 billion (€346 billion), according to a new report jointly compiled by the World Bank, the European Commission and the Ukrainian government. 
In the more than six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the country has suffered widespread destruction. 
"The impact of the invasion will be felt for generations, with families displaced and separated, disruptions to human development, destruction of intrinsic cultural heritage and reversal of a positive economic and poverty trajectory," the report states.

Newsweek: U.S. Preparing for Russia to Bring War to NATO Countries 
The U.S. State Department announced Thursday that it wants the U.S. lawmakers to approve funds for countries that neighbor Ukraine and "are potentially at risk of future Russian aggression." 
The funds would be part of a new $2 billion-plus aid package to Ukraine and its allies that has been proposed by U.S. officials. 
In a statement on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the funds would be provided to 18 nations that neighbor Ukraine. 
The $2.2 billion package, which would need to be approved by Congress, would provide roughly $1 billion to Ukraine, and the rest would be split among countries including the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia and Lithuania, the Associated Press reported, while Slovakia, Poland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Moldova and Slovenia would also receive funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hill: Milley: Russian strategic objectives in Ukraine ‘have been defeated’  
Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday said Russia’s strategic objectives in its attack on Ukraine have “been defeated.” 
“The war is not over, but so far the Russian strategic objectives have been defeated,” Milley said at a news conference alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.     
Read more ....   
Update #1: Milley’s assessment: Russia’s war in Ukraine ‘minor tactical success,’ but ‘strategic defeat’ (Washington Examiner) 
Update #2: Gen. Milley Says Russia Has Failed To Meet Strategic Objectives But War Isn't Over (Huffington Post)   
WNU editor: The video where General Milley made these remarks is above, and the transcript is here .... Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army General Mark A. Milley Hold a Press Conference Following the Ukraine Defense Contact Group Meeting, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. 
As to what is my take. I do not share General Milley's assessment. 
At the start of the war President Putin stated what was Russia's goals (link here). I see no evidence that these goals have changed, but I do see evidence that Russia has expanded its strategic objectives to include Ukrainian territories that have large Russian-Ukrainian populations. 
The narrative from the Kremlin and Russian media have also been very clear this summer. This is going to be a long war, lasting into 2023 and maybe into 2024. 
Will Russia succeed? I do not know. 
But I think it is too early for General Milley to claim Russia's strategic objectives have been defeated in Ukraine.]]></summary>

KYIV, Ukraine — Russian state television broadcast an interview Friday acknowledging that Kyiv had achieved a “substantial victory” after Ukrainian forces burst through the front line in a lightning advance. 
The Ukrainian breakthrough near Kharkiv was the fastest advance reported by either side for months, and one of the biggest shifts in the war’s momentum since Russian forces abandoned a disastrous assault on Kyiv, the capital, in March.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had “liberated dozens of settlements” and reclaimed more than 1,000 square km (385 square miles) of territory in the Kharkiv region in the east as well as Kherson in the south in the past week.

Update #2: Ukrainian soldiers advance 30 miles in 3 days in Kharkiv amid major counter-offensive (FOX News)  
Update #3: Checkpoints in Kharkov region clotted with people fleeing Ukraine’s military shelling (TASS)   
WNU Editor: Reports are that Russian forces are being rushed in .... Russia Reinforces Kharkiv in Bid to Counter Ukraine Push (Moscow Times/AFP). More here .... Russia sends reinforcements to Kharkiv to repel Ukraine counterattack (The Guardian). 
The above video from the Military Summary channel provides a good analysis on the Kharkiv front. As to what is my take. Along the entire front the Russian military is holding its own, but it is a disaster on the Kharkiv front that the Russian Ministry of Defense will need to address ASAP.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: What about inflation and the recession, Joe? Biden takes lap of honor as he releases report praising HIMSELF for 'strongest economic recovery in recent history'... despite cost of living crisis and tanking economy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Kim Jong Un declares he is ready to launch 'preventative' NUCLEAR strikes and North Korea's position as a nuclear state is 'irreversible' 
* A new law says North Korea can carry out a preventive nuclear strike 'automatically' and 'immediately to destroy the hostile forces' 
* Announcement comes at a time of heightened tensions with South Korea 
* Pyongyang blames Seoul for the outbreak of Covid-19 in its territory and has worryingly conducted a record number of weapons tests this year 
Kim Jong Un had declared he is ready to launch preventive nuclear strikes in a new law passed this week, state media said on Friday. 
Such 'preventative' strikes could be made even in the face of conventional attacks against the isolated country, the law states. 
The move effectively eliminates the possibility of denuclearisation talks, with the dictator saying the country's status as a nuclear state was now 'irreversible'.

* “The German economy is facing a difficult time ahead of us due to the Ukraine conflict, China, supply chain problems and the energy crisis,” Commerzbank CEO Manfred Knof told CNBC on Thursday. 
* “Probably the German economy is going into a downward [trajectory] and maybe into a recession but the good news is there no reason to panic,” he added. 
* Fears of a recession have been exacerbated amid the possibility of a winter gas shortage in Europe. 
The chief executive of one of Germany’s biggest banks, Commerzbank, sought to reassure investors Thursday about the prospect of non-performing loans this winter, saying banks are far better placed to cope compared to previous crises.

NEW DELHI — Indian and Chinese troops are pulling back from one of the several disputed border areas in the Himalayan mountains where they have been locked in a standoff for over two years. 
The Indian Defense Ministry said in a statement Thursday evening that troops had begun to disengage from the area of Gogra-Hotsprings “in a coordinated and planned way, which is conducive to peace and tranquility in the border areas.” 
The announcement marks a step forward in resolving a military standoff that began after a June 2020 clash in Ladakh in the western Himalayas killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.

But their discussion reflected a sea change in social attitudes: They were considering joining the military.

Its defense ministry says a stable Taiwan situation is critical for Japan's Security. 
Japan plans to beef up defenses on its remote islands in the East China Sea in preparation for a Taiwan Strait crisis, a move reflecting official strategic thinking but one likely to annoy China. 
The Japanese defense ministry wants to expand fuel and ammunition storage facilities on the Nansei (Ryukyu) island chain, the westernmost tip of which lies just 110 kilometers (68 miles) from Taiwan, Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada was quoted as saying by Nikkei Asia on Tuesday.

"We are not just losing the person - we are losing a sense of stability and … a sense of duty that a lot of people indistinctively fear is missing," Mr Bolt said.

"It's almost like a generational challenge. 

"Can we actually have someone who replicates what a Queen really does … symbolising continuity, stability in such challenging, ever-changing, fast-changing, disconcerting times that people really … look for."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: German Diplomat Who Mocked Trump At UN Suddenly Silent As President's 'Russian Energy' Warning Comes True 
One of the German diplomats who snickered when then-President Donald Trump said Germany would “become totally dependent on Russian energy” didn’t respond to a question on whether his views have changed as rising energy costs amidst the war in Ukraine seem to prove Trump right. 
Trump made the remarks during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in Sept. 2018. Trump said during the same speech: “Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation.”   
Read more ....   
WNU editor: The whole German delegation was launging at Trump, but it was Heiko Maas, was then serving as the country’s foreign minister under then-prime minister Angela Merkel, who led the laughter. He later told reporters that Trump’s claim regarding the pipeline “does not correspond to reality,” saying that “Germany is not dependent on Russia, especially not on energy issues.”
So where is Heiko Maas right now? 
Not surprising. He is still in the government as a member of the Bundestag.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Energy bills will be frozen at £2,500 for TWO YEARS: Liz Truss unveils 'extraordinary' £150bn plan to counter Putin and subsidise household costs while businesses get 'equivalent' support for six months - as she backs fracking and using North Sea reserves 
* Liz Truss is set to ease the pain of energy bills for households by freezing them at a typical level of £2,500 
* New PM insisted that failing to take action on the scale of the Covid response would damage the economy 
* But Ms Truss also warned that major changes are needed to shore up Britain's long-term energy supplies 
Liz Truss rolled the dice on her premiership today unveiling a £150billion plan to freeze energy bills for two years and counter Vladimir Putin's blackmail. 
Admitting her action is 'extraordinary', the PM told MPs the government is committed to keeping costs for households at £2,500 a year until October 2024 - less than half the level many feared they would hit. 
Including a £400 handout most people should see little change from existing bills this year.

WNU Editor: This is not going to solve the UK's energy crisis. And who wants to invest or be in the energy business if you are forced to sell your product below your costs? My guess is that the UK government is going to bail out the utilities to keep this "House of Cards" from collapsing. And as for the future in UK ....  expect more inflation and the energy crisis continuing.

European Central Bank sets aside recession fears to increase rates by 0.75 of a percentage point to 1.25% 
The European Central Bank has raised interest rates across the eurozone by a record margin to combat soaring inflation that has reached double figures in some of the currency bloc’s 19 member countries. 
Setting aside concerns that higher rates would add to the current squeeze on consumers’ disposable incomes and increase the depth of a looming recession, the central bank’s 25-member governing council raised its key benchmarks by an unprecedented 0.75 of a percentage point to 1.25%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Biden national security advisor Jake Sullivan warns China invading Taiwan is still a 'distinct threat' - as yet ANOTHER delegation of US lawmakers visits Taipei 
* White House national security advisor told Bloomberg TV that there were no current plans for President Biden and President Xi to meet at the G20 summit 
* Sullivan accused China of being inconsistent in its position on Taiwan 
* 'The American position has remained steadfast and consistent,' he said 
* Meanwhile a bipartisan delegation of members of the House of Representatives is arrived in Taiwan Wednesday and is leaving on Friday 
* That group is being led by Florida Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy 
The possibility of China invading Taiwan continues to be a 'distinct threat' to the global order, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday. 
His warning comes just a day after a top Beijing official issued a blunt warning discouraging 'stubborn' calls for the island's independence. 
 Sullivan told Bloomberg TV that the United States would 'push back' against any efforts to topple the existing world order while also reaffirming the nation's longstanding support for the One China Policy.

Times of Israel: Nuclear deal with Iran off the table for time being, US has indicated to Israel  
Message conveyed to PM Lapid in recent conversations with Biden and other US officials; Iranian demands to halt IAEA probes appear to have derailed talks 
A new nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is off the table and will not be signed in the foreseeable future, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister site Zman Yisrael has learned. 
This is the message that was conveyed to Prime Minister Yair Lapid in his recent conversations with US President Joe Biden and other administration officials. 
This emerging outcome of the nuclear negotiations, which would have major international implications, is likely to be touted by Lapid in the coming election campaign, particularly against opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly attacked the premier on the issue.

The F-35 program office “temporarily paused the acceptance of new F-35 aircraft to ensure the F-35 program’s compliance” with defense regulations “pertaining to specialty metals,” Defense Department spokesman Russell Goemaere said in an email. 
He said the pause won’t interfere with operations of F-35s already delivered to the US military and partners abroad because “the magnet does not transmit information or harm the integrity of the aircraft and there are no performance, quality, safety or security risks associated with this issue.”

The Ukrainian 'counteroffensive' in the southern Kherson region has made little progress and binds a lot of Ukrainian resources and available units.

WNU Editor: I am skeptical of the above report. The U.S. is the country that is supplying the most weapons, actionable intelligence, and funds to Ukraine. Not the U.K. or anyone else. I am sure the U.S. has a lot of strings to this aid, and taking their advice and recommendations is one of them. 
So is the Pentagon against this second counter-offensive? Maybe. But in this case my gut is telling me that it is the US State Department and the White House that is pushing this new front, and they outrank the Pentagon.]]></summary>

Risky assets have come under selling pressure in recent days as investors fear the Federal Reserve will continue its aggressive tightening policy. 
FedWatch CME Tool shows that the probability of a 75 basis point rate hike at the September meeting has risen to 80% from 69% a week ago.  This prolonged the rise of the US dollar index (DXY), which closed above 110 on September 6. 
US stock markets and cryptocurrency markets attempt a relief rally on September 7, but the recovery is only expected to continue after the DXY shows signs of bottoming out.

It’s not easy to persuade this column to watch tennis, but the task becomes easier when the US Open features classic American history.  As I write, Frances Tiafoe of the United States is about to start her quarter-final match against Russia’s Andrey Rublev.  Whatever the turn of the day, Mr. Tiafoe provided a refreshing example of courage in a country still teeming with opportunity.

Modified: 06/09/2022 19:52:11



In recent Gazette coverage of the annual Town/Robe Breakfast, the Chancellor was quoted, comparing UMass Amherst to other college towns, in terms of the number of students each school provides housing for, for show that UMass has a large percentage of students on campus, and therefore they are not responsible for the imbalances this causes in Amherst, with outside investors buying several houses, which then prevents families from moving here.
Amherst has a population of 40,000, more than half of whom are students.  That means we’re a city of 20,000 year-round residents.
And half of the homes in Amherst are rentals, most of which are student rentals, many of which are overcrowded, overpriced and poorly maintained.  I recently received another call from a telemarketer, hoping to persuade me to sell my house to a certain investment company.
Chancellor compared Amherst to the college towns of Bloomington, Indiana (population 84,691), College Station, Texas (population 115,802) and St Paul/Minneapolis (population 730,413).
    This is clearly a false equivalence.  We are the second smallest city in the nation to house a flagship state university.  That’s great for the city in many ways, but there are other repercussions that UMass shouldn’t sweep under the rug.
I urge the leaders of city and university government to have the robust and urgent conversations needed to resolve the issue fairly and effectively.  It’s one of those “if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem” thing.

A medieval-inspired luxury home in New York’s Tony Hamptons – one that looks like it’s straight out of the HBO animated series”Dragon House— caught the attention of deep-pocketed show fans wanting to make it their own, according to Jam Press.
The outlet notes that they believe they have made offers to buy it, but the owner won’t budge.
That owner is Sir Ivan Wilzig – the music producer, reality TV star, banking heir and philanthropist – who moved into “the Castle” in 1997. (Wilzig and his brother, Alan, created the broadcast after buying 5 acres of land from Water Mill for less than $1 million in 1995.)

Bill Clinton promised to close the base in 1996. But plans for more construction and a heightened focus on the Pacific put the islands and their unique biodiversity at risk indefinitely. 
One April afternoon in Tokyo, the U.S. president made a welcome promise to reduce his military’s presence in Okinawa. Three U.S. service members had raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl the previous September, and enraged locals had spent months protesting the Japanese prefecture’s dense network of U.S. bases. 
“When the Prime Minister asked us to consider the concerns of the people of Okinawa and I became acquainted with them, as a result of some of the unfortunate incidents that you know well about,” said President Bill Clinton, standing side by side with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in the April 1996 speech, “it bothered me that these matters had not been resolved before now, before this time.” His administration agreed to close the Futenma Air Station, a major Marine Corps base in the populous Okinawan city of Ginowan, within five to seven years.
