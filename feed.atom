        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Biden Will Speak With Xi on Thursday as US-China Ties Worsen 
(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday amid fresh tensions over Taiwan, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The first conversation between the two presidents since March will take place at a particularly difficult juncture for US-China ties: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s staff and security officials aren’t ruling out plans for her to visit Taiwan in early August.

WNU Editor: What caught my attention about this report is that it is the first time in four months that both leaders will be talking to each other.   I am old enough to remember when Presidents Obama and Trump talked with the Chinese leader on a regular basis. One or two times a month. 
No more now under President Biden. 

As for this call tomorrow. I have zero expectations that anything significant will be decided upon. This is a call that is being initiated by the White House to discuss trade and tariffs. 
The problem is that President Xi has already made it known publicly that he does not trust President Biden. His beef is that President Biden says he will do one thing, but the opposite happens from the White House a few days or weeks later.

Euractiv/Reuters: Ukraine's Naftogaz stumbles into default amid new debt overhaul push 
Ukraine’s Naftogaz has become the first Ukrainian government entity to default since the start of the Russian invasion, after the state energy firm said it would not make payments on international bonds before the Tuesday (26 July) expiry of a grace period. 
The default may accelerate repayments on the two other Naftogaz bonds, but does not trigger a sovereign cross-default. 
The energy company said in a statement that it had failed to get creditors’ support on a proposal to freeze payments on some of its bonds for two years, which it launched on 12 July saying Russia’s invasion meant many of its customers were now unable to pay their bills.

Daily Beast: Secret Briefing Zeroes in on Suspected Russian Spy Station in New York 
The State Department is so worried that a Russian diplomatic compound in the Bronx is serving as a Russian spy hub that it held a classified briefing about the compound on Friday. 
The previously unreported briefing touched on concerns about the compound and its potential ties to Russian espionage operations—concerns which Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) raised in March of this year when he sent a letter to the Directors of the FBI, CIA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. 
Torres, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, requested that the Biden Administration consider opening an investigation into the compound in order to protect the country against Russian espionage. 
It’s not clear what the outcome of the meeting was. Torres declined to comment on what was discussed in the meeting, citing the classified nature of the gathering. Due to security reasons, the State Department also declined to share details about the meeting.

Many settlements close to the front lines in Donetsk have come under fire in the past 24 hours as Russian forces try to break down Ukrainian defenses, according to the head of the region’s military administration. 
He added that “the front is approaching the city of Bakhmut, where there were systematic artillery fire and air strikes” on Monday.

Russian forces are estimated to be about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) southeast of the town.

Update: Enemy Preparing For Offensive On Siversk And Soledar In Donetsk Region - General Staff (Ukrainian News).

A social media post today from a senior separatist Donetsk official gave a timeline on how long he thinks it will take before the entire region of the Donbas has been cleared of Ukrainian forces. He gives it to the end of August.]]></summary>

Update: I give it 2 to 3 more years before this milestone is reached .... Coming Soon: A $1 Trillion U.S. Defense Budget? (19FortyFive).]]></summary>

   Anthony Furey, Toronto Sun: Here's why we might soon see more farmer protests across Canada 
Last week, Canadian news reports told of farm-related protests erupting across the country — including one that saw a slow roll convoy head through downtown Ottawa.

* Republicans have thrown their support behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reported upcoming trip to Taiwan 
* Newt Gingrich said Pelosi should go and she 'sought to tell the Pentagon and the State Department to shut up' about it 
* Gingrich was last speaker to visit Taiwan 
* Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also encouraged Pelosi to go 
* Pelosi has not publicly confirmed the trip 
* China has made it clear they do not want her to go 
* U.S. officials worried China could take action against island nation soon 
Republicans have thrown their support behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reported upcoming trip to Taiwan despite China warning of consequences if she visits. 
Newt Gingrich, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska are among those encouraging Pelosi to visit the island - a proposed trip that is causing a rift between the speaker and President Joe Biden's administration. 
It's unusual show of support from Republicans for the Democratic speaker and comes as amid concern China could move against the island nation soon.

Daily Mail: Germany on the brink: EU's economic powerhouse is heading for recession and energy rationing – with bills tripling – after Merkel ignored warnings Putin could cripple Europe by choking gas supplies 
* Russia is slowly choking off gas supplies to Germany, which are now down to just 20 per cent of normal level 
* Country is now facing an acute shortage over winter, amid warnings whole industries may have to shut down 
* £240billion could be wiped off the economy, experts warn, which could plunge into a recession until 2024 
* Household bills could triple, with street lights dimmed and swimming pools already shut to make savings 
* Pain is a legacy of Angela Merkel, who ignored 15 years of warnings about over-reliance on Russian energy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: EU split over standing up to Putin: Bloc agrees 'voluntary' 15% cut in fuel use to tackle Russian gas squeeze… but with loopholes for most countries, including GERMANY 
* EU agrees 15% 'voluntary' gas use reduction as Putin squeezes Europe's supply 
* However some countries opposed the move as an unfair burden on them 
* Russia recently reduced gas supply through Nord Stream 1 pipe to just 20% 
European Union countries have come together to agree a controversial 'voluntary' cut to its overall gas consumption by 15 per cent in the face of a Russian supply squeeze. 
But loopholes in the agreement will ease the pain for many countries and industries, including Germany, after some EU governments resisted the original proposal to impose binding cuts on every country. 
Europe faces an increased gas squeeze from Wednesday, when Russia's Gazprom has said it would cut flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany from 40 per cent to just a fifth of capacity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: IMF lowers growth forecast, warns of global 'recession' 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its global growth forecast to 3.2% amid high inflation and the war in Ukraine, and warned the world could be "teetering on the edge of global recession." 
In an update to its global growth forecast Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of risks to the global economy, which if left unchecked, could push the world into a recession. 
High inflation and the risks posed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine are responsible for placing the global economy in peril, the IMF said, adding that "worst case" scenarios are possible. 
In a statement, IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said, "the world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one." 
Gourinchas added that the the current environment suggests that the "likelihood that the US economy can avoid a recession" is "quite narrow."

Daniel Davis, 19FortyFive: The Dark Scenario: Ukraine’s Military Can’t Beat Russia and Collapses 
The War in Ukraine Could End Quite Badly for Kyiv: Last Wednesday, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Brown said the United States was now considering sending American fighter planes to Ukraine to join its war against Russia. The CIA Director estimated as many as 60,000 Russians had been killed or wounded since February. Though many things seem to be trending against Moscow, for very practical reasons – of which few Westerners are aware – Russia has a plausible chance of winning its war against Ukraine, while Kyiv has virtually no such path. 
This is the second in a series of three assessments of the possible outcomes of the Russia/Ukraine war between now and the end of 2022. In the first installment, we looked at the chances of a stalemate and a partial Russian victory. In this latest analysis, we look at the possibilities of either a total Russian victory or a total Ukrainian victory. Between the two prospects, this analysis reveals that Moscow has a chance of defeating Ukraine while Kyiv has virtually no chance of defeating Russia.

WNU Editor: What is note-worthy in the above post is the admission that Ukraine is losing 1,000 soldiers a day (killed and wounded), and that most of its best fighters have now been eliminated. It also admits that Ukraine needs massive quantities of weapons and military vehicles to replace what has already lost. And while I do not see the Ukraine army collapsing anytime soon, as an effective fighting force I do see them becoming inconsequential if the war continues into next year and if Western economic and military support is not significantly increased.]]></summary>

Naval News:  U.S. Navy, China And France’s Future Aircraft Carriers Compared 
The future of aircraft carriers is assured. Tomorrow's oceans will be more complex and contested, with new threats emerging. Yet the carrier will continue to provide unrivaled conventional superiority to the few navies which can operate them. Only the United States, China and France are building the largest and most capable category of carriers, the Super Carrier. 
Warfare is constantly evolving. New technologies are reshaping the way wars are fought and opening up new opportunities for the future. At the same time, existing unit types are proving their worth. This is most visible because of the war in Ukraine. In the court of popular opinion, the effectiveness of anti-tank weapons has caused many to question the future of the tank. Yet on the ground, tanks are still desperately sought by both sides. Similar debates are happening in the naval world.

Christian Orr, 19FortyFive: Why France's only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is no joke 
* The only two countries that have nuclear-powers carriers are both Western powers and NATO members. 
* The US Navy has 11 such flattops while the French Navy has one, the Charles de Gaulle. 
* Here's a detailed look at Charles de Gaulle. 
 In recent weeks, we at 19FortyFive have published several articles on how Russia's repeated attempts to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier have ended in miserable and ignominious failure.  It is no small source of embarrassment for Vladimir Putin and his Russian Navy admirals that the only two countries who have successfully launched and deployed nuke carriers are both Western powers and NATO members to boot: the United States and France.  The US Navy has 11 such mighty warships while the French Navy (Marine Natiionale) has one, the Charles de Gaulle.
Let's take a more detailed look at France's supercarrier.

I never met him, but I remember my grandmother telling how he sometimes took trips across the country.  On many of these trips, he might find himself in a city he didn’t know, and he had to find accommodation before dark, because… well, he might find himself in a city when the sun was setting.

“I humbly ask forgiveness for the wrong done by so many Christians against Indigenous peoples,” Francis told a large crowd of Indigenous people, some wearing traditional clothing and headdresses, in Maskwacis, Alberta,  the site of a former boarding school.   
The pope delivered his apology in a powwow circle, a covered ring surrounding an open space used for traditional dancing and drumming circles.  Around it were teepees, campfires and kiosks labeled “Mental Health and Cultural…]]></summary>

19Fortyfive: Is America Now Winning the Hypersonic Missile Arms Race? 
While not all has gone according to plan, it seems the U.S. military is moving forward quickly on its plan to build and deploy hypersonic missiles and weapons: On Monday, the United States announced yet another successful test of its scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile known as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC. This news comes directly on the heels of last week’s announcement of successful tests of two different kinds of hypersonic boost-glide missiles; Lockheed Martin’s AGM-183A ARRW and DARPA’s OpFires missile. 
It would seem America’s hypersonic efforts are beginning to hit their stride.   
"The test demonstrated how we’ve rapidly matured affordable scramjet technology, which is the basis for air-breathing weapons,” said Colin Whelan, president of Advanced Technology for Raytheon Missiles & Defense in a press release. 
“Our second HAWC flight test success is an important milestone for our nation as we advance hypersonic systems.”

WNU Editor: It is still too early to say who is "winning". The U.S., Russia, and China are developing hypersonic missiles for different reasons, and the technologies that they are using are different.]]></summary>

It sounded so tit for tat that many Californians wondered if he was just trying to ramp up one of his favorite foils, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas.  Others doubted he was serious because it would have meant adopting a bounty enforcement system he considered legally dubious.
Seven months later, Mr. Newsom not only signed the bill on Friday, he leaned into his anti-Republican rhetoric more than ever.  He ran ads in Florida and Texas attacking Republican state governors Ron DeSantis and Mr. Ab…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for Memphis on Saturday that will continue through Sunday evening, with temperatures expected to reach near 100 degrees with high humidity.
Sunday morning at the Memphis Pizza Cafe, Jesse Williams, 40, was preparing for a long shift in front of a 600 degree oven.
“It’s about 95 degrees here,” he said of the kitchen.  “If I didn’t have this little shop fan blowing on me, I’d probably have heatstroke.”


Mr Williams said he and other kitchen staff had to find ways to stay cool without overloading the air conditioner.


“We do things in the morning, like instead of turning on both ovens, just turn on one and wait until we’re almost open to turn on the other one,” Williams said.  “Take a break. Go stand in the walk-in for a little while and try to cool off,” he added, referring to the kitchen cooler.
After 10 years working at the cafe, Mr Williams said, he is used to working in the summer heat.
“It makes that late afternoon beer that much cooler,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A number of other organizations on either side of the issue have separately campaigned and raised funds on the amendment.
After the Supreme Court’s decision, many more people suddenly took notice of the amendment, said Melinda Lavon, a midwife who helped organize a campaign to vote against it, including text messaging blitzes and events in rural areas.  “People had a lot of emotions about it and they put it to good use.”
John Markert, who supports the amendment, said he was happy with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision but wasn’t sure it would help his side in the vote.  Along the route where he rides his bike several times a week in Lenexa, another Kansas City suburb, more and more road signs have appeared on either side of the issue.
“It brought everything to the fore,” said Markert, who was retired from the mortgage industry and who said his opposition to abortion in almost all cases was motivated by his Christian faith.  “If Roe vs. Wade wouldn’t have been upset, I think ‘Vote Yes’ would have been ‘more likely to win.  He added: “I don’t know if it’s now.”
As Election Day approached, the rhetoric heated up.  Campaign placards on both sides have been stolen or destroyed, according to police and organizers.  In the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, vandals target a Catholic church this month, splashing buildings and a statue of Mary with red paint, an episode that police have linked to the abortion debate.
Twice in the past few weeks someone tore down signs supporting the amendment at Faith Baptist Church in Salina, Kansas, pastor Jesse Rowland said.  A third sign has been placed in the cemetery.
“It’s a bit more of trench warfare – everyone is entrenched on one side or the other,” Mr Rowland said.  “No one is talking, really, from what I’ve observed.”

This month alone, Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law more than 10 new gun restrictions.  These include new limits on advertising firearms to minors;  increased dealer inspections;  and a 10-year firearms prohibition for those convicted of child abuse or elder abuse.

   Daily Mail: Has COVID gone to his head? Blase Biden dismisses recession fears - despite record inflation and nation bracing for second quarterly drop in GDP this THURSDAY 
* White House is insisting that two quarters of economic decline isn't a recession - even though it meets the technical definition of one 
* ‘We're not coming into recession in my view,' Biden said 
* 'In terms of the technical definition, it's not a recession, the technical definition considers a much broader spectrum of data points,'  Brian Deese told CNN 
* GDP data for second quarter is out on Thursday 
* Some predicting another quarter of decline 
* White House trying to get ahead of the numbers 
* On Wednesday, Fed Reserve expected to increase interest rates again   resident 
Joe Biden on Monday said the country is not going into a recession, doubling down on his administration's insistence that two quarters of economic decline isn't one - even though it meets the technical definition. 
‘We're not coming into recession in my view,' he told reporters during a virtual meeting at the White House. 
'The employment rate is still the lowest we've had in history. My hope is we go from this rapid growth to steady growth. And so we'll see we'll see some coming down. But I don't think we're going to, God willing, I don't think we're gonna see a recession,' he said.

* Hochstein doesn't expect end of SPR releases to result in oil price spikes. 
The record-high release of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve will end as scheduled this fall, the White House's Special Presidential Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein told Yahoo Finance.
"We can't be an oil supplier. It's a reserve and so we have to keep that," Hochstein said, adding that he did not expect this to lead to price spikes because the oil industry was already preparing to increase production once the SPR release ended.

DW: 'Killer robots': Will they be banned? 
A United Nations panel in Geneva remains split on whether to ban autonomous weapons, which don't need a human to pull the trigger. The war in Ukraine is complicating the conversation.

The Oak Fire, which ignited and spread rapidly on Friday, has burned a total of 16,800 acres and could still threaten 3,300 homes and businesses.  As of Monday morning, seven structures had been destroyed – an earlier estimate said 10 – and more than 3,000 residents had been ordered to evacuate.
Cal Fire, the state’s lead firefighting agency, said in a statement late Sunday that firefighters had made “good progress” against the blaze and that protective cleanup by fire crews was protecting small communities of Lushmeadows and Mariposa Pines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Ryan Kelley, Republican candidate for governor of Michigan, was billed last month with trespassing and other crimes related to the capitol storming, he openly embraced his accused status on January 6.
On Friday, Mr. Kelley again relied on a part of his biography that many candidates might have shunned: he posted a message on his official Facebook page asking that “all J6 prisoners” be released from federal custody. .
“Every American should be outraged,” wrote Mr. Kelley, who is not in custody awaiting trial.  “Don’t forget you could be next for any reason the ‘big government’ doesn’t approve of.”


In early June, when he was charged with four misdemeanors related to the Capitol riot, Mr. Kelley became the first candidate in a major federal or state election to be charged in the attack.  Prosecutors say he used ‘his hands to support another rioter’ who was tearing down a metal barricade outside the building, and waved ‘at the crowd, consistently indicating’ that they should keep going. head for an entrance.


With polls showing him trailing favorite Tudor Dixona conservative businesswoman and commentator, and other candidates, Mr. Kelley, a real estate broker, is unlikely to win the Republican primary on Aug. 2.  The winner will face the incumbent, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.
No later than Wednesday evening, during a candidate debateMr. Kelley has spoken openly about his Capitol riot charges, treating them as an asset, not a liability.
He claimed, for example, that after his arrest, Airbnb closed his account.
“Look how hard these people try to shut me up,” he said.  “They’re not trying to silence the rest of you.”

Latino, officials said.
The investigation, sparked by hundreds of resident complaints filed by a local legal aid group, will likely be one of the most far-reaching environmental justice reviews undertaken by the department in recent years.
The investigation will be conducted by the Civil Rights Division in coordination with the ministry’s new environmental justice office.

In a crowded ceremony in the East Room of the White House on July 7, Mr. Biden awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, out of 16 Americans, some in their 80s or 90s. After reaching out to hang the medal around their necks, the president kissed most of them, shook hands with a few -ones and gave three a peck on the cheek.
It is very unlikely that Mr Biden – who tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday – was infected with the coronavirus during this event.

Maria Zakharova posted on her Telegram account "Kalibr missiles destroyed military infrastructure in the port of Odessa, with a high-precision strike." 
Russia earlier had denied any involvement in the Saturday strike that came a day after Russia and Ukraine had signed agreements allowing Ukraine to ship millions of tons of grain out of its Black Sea port.

CNN: Russian Navy's massive submarine could set the stage for 'a new Cold War' in the oceans 
Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The Russian Navy has taken delivery of what is the world's longest known submarine, one its maker touts as a research vessel -- but what others say is a platform for espionage and possibly nuclear weapons. 
The Belgorod was turned over to the Russian Navy earlier this month in the port of Severodvinsk, according to the country's largest shipbuilder, Sevmash Shipyard. 
Experts say its design is a modified version of Russia's Oscar II class guided-missile submarines, made longer with the aim to eventually accommodate the world's first nuclear-armed stealth torpedoes and equipment for intelligence gathering.

The story of Russia’s iconic Typhoon class submarines looks to be getting closer to its conclusion.   
Russian state media reports have offered conflicting details today about the status of the last Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine in active service, the Dmitry Donskoy. Though the fate of this submarine, the largest by displacement of any type in existence, is unclear, by all indications it is moving ever-closer to its retirement. 
RIA Novosti, citing anonymous sources, was the first to report that Dmitry Donskoy, also known by its hull number TK-208, had been formally decommissioned and was headed for the scrap yard. Anonymous sources from within Russia's state-run shipbuilding industry and the country's security services subsequently told TASS that this news was incorrect and that any final decision about the submarine's future would not come until December at the earliest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: Russia to cut Nord Stream 1 gas flow to 20% of capacity 
 Russia's Gazprom said it would again reduce gas deliveries through Nord Stream 1 for 'repairs,' cutting the current flow in half. The new blow to supply comes as Europe scrambles to store gas for winter. 
Russian gas giant Gazprom said Monday it was cutting daily gas deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 33 million cubic metres starting Wednesday. 
That would correspond to 20% of the pipeline's capacity. The current flow of gas into Germany is only at 40%. 
Nord Steam 1 begins north of Saint Petersburg in Russia and ends at a station near Greifswald on Germany's northern Baltic Sea coast. 
The company said it was halting the operation of another turbine due to the "technical condition of the engine".

McCain (DDG 56), USS Vandegrift (FFG 48) and USNS Tippecanoe (T-AO 199) in the Western Pacific Ocean on June 18, 2006, to start exercise Valiant Shield 2006. The joint exercise consists of 28 naval vessels including three carrier strike groups and more than 300 aircraft and approximately 20,000 service members from the Navy, Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast.    
Politico: Inside the Pentagon slugfest over the future of the fleet 
No one can agree on how many ships the Navy needs, and Congress isn't pleased. 
The Navy of the future needs 316 ships. Actually, make that 327. No, more like 367. You know what? Let’s make it 373, or maybe even 500. 
At different points this year, the Pentagon and Navy leaders have floated all five numbers as the desired size of the Navy, the result of a high-stakes — and still raging — internal battle among top Navy, Marine Corps and Pentagon leaders. 
And the discord at the top has real-world consequences for America’s sea service, denying lawmakers a number to shoot for as they figure out how many ships to buy in the fiscal year that starts in October, and beyond. 
At issue, according to six people with knowledge of internal discussions, is the desired number of amphibious warships, which carry Marines and can launch warplanes and landing craft.

Democracy figures, including former lawmaker in Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, executed after being accused of carrying out ‘terror acts’ 
Myanmar’s junta has executed four prisoners including a former politician and a veteran activist, drawing shock and revulsion at the country’s first use of capital punishment in decades.
Junta-controlled media reported on Monday that four men, including Phyo Zeya Thaw, a rapper and former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, and the prominent democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu, known as Jimmy, had been executed. 
They were accused of conspiring to commit terror acts and were sentenced to death in January in closed trials.

WSWS: US considers deploying carriers to support House speaker’s Taiwan trip - Washington Post 
The US military is considering “moving aircraft carriers or sending fighter planes for close air support” as part of a potential trip by US house speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, the Washington Post reported Saturday. 
The discussions about US military actions in support of Pelosi’s trip were first reported in an op-ed by Josh Rogin, who wrote, 
The U.S. military is devising options for protecting Pelosi’s delegation, who—as is normal procedure for congressional delegations to Taiwan—would be flying on a military plane. The measures under consideration include moving aircraft carriers or sending fighter planes for close air support. That, in turn, could be misinterpreted by the Chinese side as an aggressive rather than a defensive measure. 
The discussions took place amid warnings by Chinese officials that the scheduled trip by Pelosi could trigger a military clash between Chinese and US forces.

WNU Editor: It is not everyday that I post something from the World Socialist Web Site, but they are spot on in their analysis that if House Speaker Pelosi should decide to visit Taiwan, the US military will be present in force.   
Update: I am not alone. The Pentagon also sees this Pelosi trip as a bad idea .... Biden on Pelosi trip to Taiwan: 'The military thinks it's not a good idea' (Politico).]]></summary>

Roads emptied and people were ordered to stay indoors in parts of Taiwan, including its capital Taipei, on Monday for an air-raid exercise as the island steps up preparations in the event of a Chinese attack. 
Sirens sounded at 1:30 p.m. (0530 GMT) for the mandatory street evacuation drills, which effectively shut towns and cities across northern Taiwan for 30 minutes. 
A “missile alert,” asking people to evacuate to safety immediately, was sent via text message. 
“It is necessary to make preparations in the event of a war,” Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je said in a speech after overseeing drills for the exercise named Wan An, which means everlasting peace.

Russian-Israeli diamond oligarch Lev Leviev and Russian property developer God Nisanov are the latest high-profile Russians known to have applied for citizenship under the legislation.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that Nisanov, who was hit by sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, was "one of the richest men in Europe and a close associate of several Russian officials".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BANGKOK (Reuters) -Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Saturday, emerging on top in his last major test ahead of a general election due within 11 months.

Prayuth received 256 votes in favour and 206 against with nine abstentions. The opposition had needed more than 239 of the 477 parliamentary votes to oust him.

KYIV (Reuters) - The United States promised more military support for Ukraine, including drones, and is doing preliminary work on whether to send fighter aircraft, as fighting raged on in the east of the country five months into Russia's invasion.
Moscow and Kyiv signed a landmark deal on Friday to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports. However, representatives declined to sit at the same table and avoided shaking hands at the agreement ceremony in Istanbul, reflecting wider enmity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Friday's agreement as unlocking around $10 billion worth of grain exports, needed to ease a food crisis.
But on the war, he said there could be no ceasefire unless lost territory was retaken.

BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombian President-elect Gustavo Petro on Friday met with representatives of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in Bogota, the Colombian capital, where they discussed topics including drug trafficking, the environment and economic development.
Petro, a 62-year-old economist who will become Colombia's first leftist leader next month, has been roundly critical of the U.S.-led war on drugs and was elected on promises to tackle deep inequality and climate change and to seek peace with remaining leftist rebels.
"This is a positive meeting because it shows the interest that exists in the government of the United States in Latin America and in Colombia," Petro told journalists, as he was accompanied by U.S. principal deputy nationa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The murders in June of British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon were likely sparked when they sought to photograph a boat belonging to their killers, the Attorney General's office said Friday.
Pereira had asked Phillips to photograph the boat, according to a statement from the office that said this detail may count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
The details were revealed after the filing Thursday of charges against the three men suspected of committing the double murder.
Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima have both confessed to the crime, according to officials, while Oseney da Costa de Oliveira -- brother of Amarildo -- has not.
The trio stands accused of murder in the first degree and of hiding the bodies.
"Bruno was killed by three bullets, one in the back without any possibility of defense," said the statement.
"Dom was killed simply because he was with Bruno, in order to ensure impunity for the previous crime."
Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead while returning from an expedition in a remote region of the rainforest that is plagued by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and fishing.
Phillips, the author of dozens of articles on the Amazon and a long-time contributor to The Guardian newspaper and other major news organizations, was traveling to the Javari Valley as part of research for a book.
Pereira was serving as his guide, and had previously traveled with him to the area.
An outspoken defender of Indigenous rights, Pereira had received multiple death threats prior to his murder.
Police are investigating a possible link to illegal fishing on protected Indigenous lands -- an issue close to Pereira's heart -- as a motive for the killing.

When the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, won a landslide victory in May, 2022, he went to visit the home of his mother Imelda, former first lady and wife of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. 
In a video showing mother congratulating son, one detail in Imelda’s opulent home stood out. On the wall, was a distinctive painting of an abstract nude rendered in blues and greens, on a red and orange bed. It was unmistakably Pablo Picasso’s “Femme Couchée VI”.

Lustosa wears no specialized suit or gloves, however, just a light net to cover his face. These bees are stingless.
"What a wonder!" Lustosa marvels at the honey-filled wax craters in the hive as the bees attack him furiously, but impotently -- his childlike amazement not diminished by six years working with the insects.
Long overlooked, Brazil's native bees are making a comeback, with people such as Lustosa, a 66-year-old public servant, getting in on the movement to boost their profile.
Of 550 stingless bee species known to exist in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world, some 250 are found in Brazil, according to Cristi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department issued two general licenses on Friday authorizing certain transactions related to Russia sanctions.
One license authorizes transactions related to the settlement of credit derivative transactions that reference Russia, according to a notice posted on Treasury's website.
The license authorizes financial institutions to facilitate and clear such transactions, examples of which include the delivery of debt obligations of Russia, the notice said.
A separate license authorizes, through October 19, wind-down transactions involving securities issued by Russia-based entities under agreements that were entered into before June 6.

Worst hit is expected to be Milan in the north with temperatures hitting 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), while Bologna to its south and the capital Rome could hit 39 degrees, according to official government estimates.
Other major cities under a cautionary heatwave red alert for Friday and Saturday by Italy's health ministry include Florence, Genoa, Turin and Verona.
On Thursday, the city of Pavia, just south of Milan, broke a record with thermometers hitting 39.6 degrees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's nuclear regulator on Friday formally approved a plan to release more than a million tonnes of treated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean.
The plan has already been adopted by the government and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but plant operator TEPCO must still win over local communities before going ahead.
The country's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved TEPCO's plan, according to a foreign ministry statement, which said the government would ensure the safety of the treated water as well as the "reliability and transparency of its handling".
Cooling systems at the plant were overwhelmed by a tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake on March 11, 2011, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.

The long-legged birds have traditionally flown from across Europe to African pastures for the winter and returned in the spring.
But the abundant food found in landfills combined with warmer weather are making growing numbers of storks skip this arduous journey and stay in Spain for the winter.
"For us they are part of the landscape," said Carlos Pinto, a sanitation worker at a landfill in Pinto some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Madrid.
The landfill receives between 200 tonnes and 300 tonnes of food waste per day and the storks head immediately to the zones "where there is fresh garbage," he added.

The colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned "Iroojlaplap", or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.
The coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a "Kailoojoj" in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.
It was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.
The blowing of a conch shell heralded each stage of the elaborate ceremony, whic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.
Biden on Thursday insisted he was "doing great", and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.
"I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery," Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.
It is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.
The pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
The leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.
Earlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the "next ten days", weeks after both countries' top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.
Beijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.
Pelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: "Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese."]]></summary>

Here is what we know about the deal:
Joint command and control
A joint command and control centre will be set up in Istanbul to oversee smooth operations and resolve disputes.
Its participants will include the two warring sides and officials from Turkey and the United Nations.
UN officials believe that the centre will take three to four weeks to be set up. This means that grain might not start flowing at full speed again until the second half of August.
Its location in Istanbul is both a nod to Turkey's central location and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's key role in resolving a dispute which has often seemed to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Page Six is reporting on a new book by Tom Bower, Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the war between the Windsors, that alleges the top racist in Buckingham Palace is Camilla Parker Bowles, the second wife of the forthcoming King of England. 
In a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey the Duke of Sussex revealed that prior to the birth of their son, an unnamed family member asked what color baby Archie's skin would be. The Duchess said that there were "several conversations" but the Duke said “That conversation, I am never going to share. At the time, it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.”
She later explained that Harry wanted to stress that the comments did not come from his elderly grandparents. 
According to the book: “The Sussexes’ suspicion that the Duchess of Cornwall had made racist comments abo…]]></summary>

With his electoral campaign to reconquer Brazil in full swing, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is avidly courting this voting bloc, which is one of Brazilian politics’ biggest prizes and could determine the winner of the next election.
In Rio de Janeiro's bustling Floriano Square in the city centre, residents hurry along to the sound of street vendors and passing tram cars. In this busy setting, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God might almost go unnoticed. However, some 50 people have passed through its doors to worship at lunchtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The slaughter of 29 dogs by men armed with rifles in Qatar has sparked outrage in the Gulf state as it gears up to host the World Cup later this year.
Authorities say police are investigating the killings, the worst of a series of brutal cases of cruelty to dogs.
But they face criticism from animal welfare activists who say laws defending domestic animals like dogs are not being enforced.
The latest killings took place at an industrial compound near the capital Doha on July 10, but the slaughter was only reported days later, activists told AFP.
Four men, two armed with hunting rifles, threatened guards at the factory and then killed 29 dogs and puppies, activists said. At least three others were wounded, including two in the late stages of pregnancy.
When the men showed up the dogs started…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Mexican disability rights activist has died after she was attacked and set on fire in the state of Jalisco, the local prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of "I take care of Mexico," an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities.
Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a press conference, citing witnesses.
Padilla died Tuesday from the "seriousness of the injuries" in a hospital in nearby Guadalajara, he said.
She had burns on 90 percent of her body.
In Mexico, an average of 10 women are murdered daily, according to official figures. Many of these cases bear the hallmarks of gender-based violence.
"We condemn the murder of #care activist Luz Raquel Padilla in #Jalisco, as well as any form of violence against people who defend women's human rights and fight against gender-based violence," UN Women Mexico wrote on Twitter.
Padilla was living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor.
She had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor's behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son's health.
On May 17, she posted photographs on Twitter of threatening graffiti outside her home.
"You're going to die," and "I'm going to burn you alive," the messages read.
"How long am I going to have to live in fear that something could happen to me and my family," she wrote next to the images.
The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, said prosecutors, indicating that the neighbor had been called to testify.
Her son had been left in the custody of his grandmother, whom the Jalisco government would support, the office said.
This year at least 43 people have been lynched and 173 injured in mob attacks in Mexico, according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission.]]></summary>

Dr. Bruno Oberle, the director-general of IUCN—the world's leading scientific authority on species conservation—said the new listing "highlights the fragility of nature's wonders, such as the unique spectacle of monarch butterflies migrating across thousands of kilometers," a reference to the insects' remarkable biannual journey across North America.
"To preserve the rich diversity of nature, we need effective, fairly governed protected and conserved areas, alongside decisive action to tackle climate change and restore ecosystems," Oberle added. "In …]]></summary>
