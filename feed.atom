The Biden administration is again delaying a replenishment of the nation’s emergency oil reserve because of market conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. The decision comes as oil prices have rallied above $80 a barrel. 
The Department of Energy is not taking up offers it got for a potential purchase, said the people, who asked not to be identified as details of the process haven’t been published. The administration rejected offers in January. 
“The DOE remains committed to its replenishment strategy for the SPR, including direct purchases when we can secure a good deal for taxpayers; exchange returns; and cancellation of planned sales where drawdown is unnecessary, in coordination with Congress,” Energy Department Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Bartol said.

Anadolu Agency: US warns Wagner attack on NATO will be treated as Russian attack

 
Wagner Group, at behest of Russian government, is a threat to us all, says Linda Thomas-Greenfield 
The US ambassador to the United Nations warned Monday that any attack on NATO by Russia’s Wagner Group will be treated as an attack by Russia. 
Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the remarks while briefing reporters in New York on various issues including ending famine, combating food insecurity in conflicts and defending human rights. 
Asked about the presence of Wagner Group mercenaries on the Polish border and whether she sees them as a real threat to NATO, she said: "We certainly worry that this group, at the behest of the Russian government – because they do not work independently of the Russian government – is a threat to all of us." 
She emphasized that the message should be clear that "any attack by the Wagner Group will be seen as an attack by the Russian government.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gallup: Biden Averages 40.7% Job Approval in 10th Quarter 
 * Biden’s 10th-quarter average approval was one point higher than ninth quarter 
* Only Carter’s 10th-quarter average was lower than Biden’s 
* Favorable rating of Biden is 41%; Kamala Harris, 38% 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Joe Biden’s job approval rating during his 10th quarter in office averaged 40.7%, marking a one-percentage-point uptick from last quarter, which was the lowest of his presidency.

 
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: These low job approval numbers are happening at the same time when all the media focus is on former President Trump. A US economy that has low unemployment numbers, and the appearance that inflation is going down. 
So why the low numbers? 
 I think there is a lot more at play right now. I think most Americans now realize that President Biden has serious cognitive issues that will get worse with time. And then there is the economy. Americans may be working but the cost of living is making a lot of people nervous, and coupled with high interest rates and high debt levels, creating an anxiety level that I have not seen for a long time. And then there are the corruption stories like this one .... Joe Biden Met With Moscow Mayor's Wife Before $3.5 Million Wire To Hunter: Devon Archer (Zero Hedge) and this one .... Devon Archer Spills The Beans: Tells Congress About Shady Burisma Dealings, Joe Biden's "More Than 20" Conversations (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>

A skyscraper in Russia's capital Moscow has been attacked by a drone for the second time in two days, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said. 
Several drones were shot down overnight on Monday, he said, but "one flew into the same tower at the Moskva City complex" that was targeted on Sunday. 
Russia's defence ministry blamed Ukraine for the latest attack.

Kyiv did not comment on responsibility but warned Russia that the conflict could soon move to its territory. 
It did not address separate Russian claims that three Ukrainian sea drones were destroyed while trying to attack Russian naval ships in the Black Sea, though did dismiss as "fictitious" further claims that Russian civilian ships had also been targeted.

Millions of people have been hit by extreme weather events and prolonged heatwaves around the globe in recent weeks, events that scientists say are being exacerbated by climate change.
And the Beijing Meteorological Service said the capital has just experienced the "heaviest rainfall in 140 years", when city authorities started keeping records.
"The maximum (amount) of rainfall recorded during this storm, which was 744.8 millimeters, occurred at the Wangjiayuan Reservoir in Changping," the service said, adding the largest volume previously recorded was 609 millimeters in 1891.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One person was reportedly killed and hundreds of thousands were without electricity in southern Japan on Wednesday as a typhoon approached packing powerful winds and lashing rain.
Hundreds of flights to Okinawa and other islands in the area were cancelled, stranding thousands of tourists holidaying in the region's tropical beach resorts.
Typhoon Khanun, described as "very strong" by the Japanese weather agency, brought maximum sustained wind speeds of 180 kilometers (112 miles) an hour.
Okinawa's power company said 220,580 households -- nearly 35 percent of the total in the region -- had no electricity early on Wednesday.
An evacuation warning issued across Okinawa and the southern part of Kagoshima region was in place, urging more than 690,000 residents to move to safety, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
The agency said a total of 11 people in Okinawa were mildly injured.
A 90-year-old man died after being trapped under a collapsed garage on Tuesday evening, public broadcaster NHK reported, adding that strong winds were probably the cause.
The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of flooding and landslides in some parts of the main island of Okinawa.
The typhoon was about 70 kilometers south of Okinawa's remote Kumejima island at 2300 GMT and was moving west-northwest, according to the JMA.
It was expected to cross to eastern China later in the week.
More than 400 flights were cancelled on Wednesday, according to NHK, affecting more than 65,000 passengers.
On Tuesday, tourists made long queues at the main Naha airport, hoping to get back home.
"We haven't been able to secure a hotel and we don't know when the return flight can be booked," Minako Kawakami told local daily Okinawa Times.]]></summary>

Maitresse Libondans is a practitioner of "catch-fetiche," also called voodoo wrestling -- a wildly over-the-top Congolese sport where fighters grapple with each other and use magic to try to gain supremacy.
She will only step into the ring if her ancestors, reached through spiritual rites, assure her of conquest.
And once in combat, she uses her signature fighting technique: baring her chest to hypnotize her opponent.

Reuters: Russia Says It Thwarts Ukrainian Attacks on Navy and Civilian Ships in Black Sea 
(Reuters) -Russia's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had thwarted attacks by Ukrainian sea drones on its navy and civilian ships in the Black Sea, and a local governor said authorities had also downed a drone over the Crimean city of Sevastopol. 
Kyiv denied that it had attacked civilian ships, without directly addressing the claim that it had attacked Russia's navy. 
"During the night the armed forces of Ukraine made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Sergei Kotov and Vasiliy Bykov patrol ships of the Black Sea fleet with three unmanned sea boats," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico.eu:  Niger coup sparks concerns about French, EU uranium dependency 
Niger is the provider of 15 percent of France’s uranium needs and accounts for a fifth of the EU’s uranium stock. 
The military coup in Niger is raising fears, especially in France, over its potential impact on the import of uranium to power nuclear plants.

Niger supplies 15 percent of France’s uranium needs and accounts for a fifth of the EU’s total uranium imports. Orano, France's state-controlled nuclear fuel producer, is continuing its activities in Niger and monitoring the situation, a company spokesperson said in a statement emailed to POLITICO, stressing that "our priority is to maintain the safety of our employees in the country." 
The French government and energy experts were quick to stress that the tensions will not have any immediate impact on France's needs for uranium as extraction is continuing and, should it stop, existing stocks could still cover approximately two years.

Update: Niger coup raises questions about uranium dependence (AFP).

 
WNU Editor: The official line is there is nothing to worry about and they are probably right .... EU sees 'no immediate risks' if Niger cuts uranium supplies (Reuters). But Niger is one of the world's largest producers of uranium, and if this export ban continues prices are going to increase even more than the current spike in prices .... Uranium price ticks up after Niger coup, more gains expected (Reuters).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico:  Ukraine’s plan if Russia assassinates Zelenskyy 
A Russian assassination would deprive Ukraine’s war effort of one of its most valuable assets. 
WASHINGTON — When Volodymyr Zelenskyy was asked whether he was worried by Russian attempts to kill him, he answered he couldn’t afford to be. 
“If I were thinking about it constantly, I would just shut myself down, very much like Putin now who doesn’t leave his bunker,” the Ukrainian leader said in an interview with CNN last month. “Of course, my bodyguards should think how to prevent this from happening, and this is their task. I don’t think about it.” 
While it’s a question Zelenskyy understandably isn’t eager to contemplate, it’s also one his supporters at home and abroad can’t afford to ignore. Ever since he rebuffed an evacuation offer by telling his would-be American rescuers “I need ammunition, not a ride,” the Ukrainian president has played a key role in mustering international support for the fight against Russia.

WNU Editor: If I was responsible for Zelensky's personal security, I would be worried about a Russian missile strike, but I would also be worried on what the hard-line elements in the Ukraine government or military would do if this war grinds on, and Zelensky is put in a position where he must make a compromised deal with Putin. 
There are elements within his government who want nothing less than the complete expulsion of the Russian military and the eradication of the Russian language and culture within the country. There is no compromise with these people, and I have no idea on how Zelensky will be able to placate them or even if he wants to. 
One more note.

If Zelensky is assassinated, the person who will replace him is Ukraine’s Parliament chairman Ruslan Stefanchuk.I do not know much about this politician, but I do know that some of my Ukrainian family, friends, and contacts do not trust him.]]></summary>

Former Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer appeared before House Oversight Committee in closed-door hearing 
Hunter Biden’s former business partner Devon Archer appeared Monday on Capitol Hill, detailing what members of Congress familiar with the closed-door interview described as proof President Biden "lied" about having no knowledge of his son's business dealings. 
Here are five key takeaways from Archer's hours-long interview with members of the House Oversight Committee investigating the Biden family finances:

WNU Editor: There was a time when Devon Archer was a close friend to Hunter Biden and the Biden family. It is safe to say that they are no longer friends. 
Two more notes. 
(1) I have noticed a shift in the White House language on President Biden and his claim that he did not know what were his son's business dealings were. The message now is "he was not involved in his son's business dealings". 
(2) The main stream media is avoiding this story even though it is an important story. On Politico and The Hill for example, their entire focus today is on Trump.

Reuters: 'The Russians Were Waiting for Us': Ukraine Troops Describe Tougher Fight Than Expected 
SOUTHERN DONETSK PROVINCE, Ukraine (Reuters) - They rode into a kill zone. The timing was off. Many men were lost. In the end, they recaptured the ruined village of Staromaiorske, claiming Ukraine's biggest advance for weeks. 
Troops at the spearhead of Ukraine's counteroffensive say a battle last week along the front in the southeast proved to be tougher and bloodier than expected, with plans going awry and an enemy that was well-prepared. 
"The Russians were waiting for us," said a 29-year-old soldier using the call-sign Bulat, from a unit sent into battle in armoured vehicles during last week's assault. 
"They fired anti-tank weapons and grenade launchers at us. My vehicle drove over an anti-tank mine, but everything was ok, the vehicle took the hit, and everyone was alive. We dismounted and ran towards the cover. Because the most important is to find cover and then move on.”

 WNU Editor: There are two different strategies at play in this war. The Ukraine side is focused on fighting a campaign to seize territory. The Russian side is fighting a war of attrition. 
Was it worth throwing away hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers and dozens of armored vehicles to seize a small village? Reading the above accounts from these Ukrainian soldiers it appears that they have some doubts. I know on the Russian side, this is exactly the fight that they want to see happening.]]></summary>

Newsweek: Russia Deploys Boom Defenses Around Crimea Bridge To Block Drone Strikes 
Moscow has laid out floating, spiked boom defenses in the hope of fending off Ukrainian drone attacks in Crimea, according to Mash, a Russian news outlet known for sharing exclusive content sourced from Moscow security agencies. 
Booms are long barriers deployed on water that aim to stop surface drones getting close to their targets. 
The booms are likely intended to make it more difficult for Ukrainian unmanned surface Surface Vehicles (USVs) to attack critical Russian infrastructure like bridges, according to Marina Miron, a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of War Studies at King's College London, U.K.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  NTK Academic Group’s Achievement on IBDP Tuition  As students approach the IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme) or other final school exams which pave the way to further education, most can benefit from extra tuition to help them navigate through the confusion of syllabus changes and stricter marking schemes.  Typically, these sessions cover all the key aspects of the relevant curriculum, elucidating and reinforcing as and where necessary. But ideally, they will also do more by providing insights and practical tips on everything from study techniques and essay writing to exam strategies, time management and independent learning skills in order for students to achieve the best possible results.     “Our courses give students a stronger academic foundation and help them develop the skills they need to succeed in higher education and beyond,” says Mr T. K. Eric Ng, Founder of NTK Academic Group, which has been operating in Hong Kong for almost 28 years. “We can create individualised learning plans based on each student’s academic needs and targets. These plans outline specific goals to work towards and progress is regularly assessed.”   NTK’s teachers, many of whom have advanced degrees from renowned universities like Oxford, Cambridge and the Ivy League, are among the best in their fields. This ensures that students receive high-quality instruction and support from a knowledgeable and experienced team.  A wide range of subjects is on offer, not just for the IBDP curriculum, but also for the IGCSE, GCE A-Levels and the standardised university admissions tests often required of candidates applying from international schools and boarding schools.   As a result, NTK has helped more than 80 students achieve full scores (a total of 45 marks) in the IBDP over the past three years, with a further 200 getting a 7 in various subjects.     “Whether for group courses using proprietary materials developed by IBDP…]]></summary>

Politics: U.S. expects to begin delivering Abrams tanks to Ukraine in September

 
The news, provided by six people familiar with discussions, marks the most specific information to date on Washington’s plans. 
U.S. Abrams tanks are likely to arrive on the Ukrainian battlefield in September, according to six people familiar with the planning, as Kyiv’s forces push to retake territory in a counteroffensive that is picking up steam. 
The plan is to send a handful of Abrams tanks to Germany in August, where they will undergo final refurbishments. 
Once that process is complete, the first batch of Abrams will be shipped to Ukraine the following month.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
