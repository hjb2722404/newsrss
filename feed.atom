        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong recently unveiled a list of its best – and worst – public toilets, with the Peak Tower, a shopping complex popular with tourists, winning the gold medal. But the city has another gold standard loo-related achievement, Hong Kong holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive toilet bowl, a golden creation worth HK$27 million (US$3.5 million). The solid-gold “throne” formed part of a gaudy jewellery showroom built using two tonnes of the precious metal which carried an overall price tag US$38 million. Swisshorn Gold Palace, which was also known as The Golden House and the Hall of Gold, was in the city’s Kowloon area and it boasted a floor-to-ceiling gold design, including a gold horse-drawn chariot, gold chandeliers and life-size gold statues. Even the cutlery and crockery was gold.  But behind a door with engraved pharaohs, Greek gods and harp-playing angels, stood the palace’s crown jewel: a fully functional solid gold toilet. After opening to the public in September 2006, it attracted thousands of visitors a day, mostly tourists from mainland China. The venue was also hired out for weddings and corporate events. The man with the Midas touch behind the project was entrepreneur Lam Sai-wing who moved to Hong Kong from Guangdong province in southern China when he was 21 and went on to become chairman of the jewellery-making company Hang Fung Gold Technology.  Lam wanted to build a shrine to his boyhood hero, Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, who had said that after the victory of socialism, gold should be used to make toilets. “It has been my dream to build this since I was 16 years old. Now it has come true,” said Lam in a story published in the Post in 2002. “I’m a capitalist with socialist principles,” he said at the time, adding: “This toilet is for the public, I wouldn’t have one at home.” But in 2008, the economy - and Lam’s company - was hit by the fallout from the global financial crisis. What wasn’t suffering, however, was the price of gold: in 2008 it had reached an all-time record…]]></summary>

   SCMP: Mystery airship spotted over Philippines near South China Sea 
* Images of an unidentified craft near Subic Bay have sparked speculation it could have been collecting military intelligence 
*There is no evidence the airship was from China, though its design appears similar to types on display at the Zhuhai air show 
An unidentified high-altitude, long-endurance airship spotted near a former US naval base in the Philippines has raised concerns that some countries in the region are using stratospheric airships to collect military intelligence. 
Images of the stratospheric airship - allegedly taken in Pangasinan province, about 100km (62 miles) from Subic Bay in the northern Philippine island of Luzon - were first posted on Facebook last weekend. The pictures were deleted, but not before they were also shared on Twitter.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, during which Wang called on the US to stop its old tricks of unilateral bullying and containing China's development.  
Analysts said that the US needs to strengthen the credibility of its China policy, control the negative factors and actively maintain the trend of positive cooperation brought by the latest meeting between the heads of state, which is in line with the interests of both China and the US as well as the rest of the world.  Wang told Blinken in the phone call that the two countries should focus on turning the consensus reached by the top leaders into tangible policies and actions.

Zero Hedge: More Than Half Of House Republicans Didn't Attend Zelensky's Address 
More than half of House Republicans didn’t attend Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s Wednesday night address to Congress, The Hill reported on Thursday. 
According to The Hill, 86 out of 213 House Republicans were at the Capitol for Zelensky’s speech. While some of the absences could be explained by lawmakers getting an early start on Christmas travel, as about a third of House members had active letters to vote by proxy on Wednesday, there is growing opposition to the policy of arming Ukraine among Republicans.

(Bloomberg) -- Nearly 37 million people in China may have been infected with Covid-19 on a single day this week, according to estimates from the government’s top health authority, making the country’s outbreak by far the world’s largest.  
As many as 248 million people, or nearly 18% of the population, likely contracted the virus in the first 20 days of December, according to minutes from an internal meeting of China’s National Health Commission held on Wednesday, confirmed with people involved in the discussions. 
If accurate, the infection rate would dwarf the previous daily record of about 4 million, set in January 2022.  
Beijing’s swift dismantling of Covid Zero restrictions has led to the unfettered spread of the highly contagious omicron variants in a population with low levels of natural immunity. More than half the residents of Sichuan province, in China’s southwest, and the capital Beijing have been infected, according to the agency’s estimates.

Marine Times: Why the Marine Corps may nix gender identifiers for drill instructors 
A new academic report on efforts to integrate Marine Corps boot camp recommends dropping gender-specific salutations for drill instructors, but service leaders are not convinced they want to take that step. 
The lengthy report, commissioned by the Corps from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020 and completed in 2022, points out that half of the military services already have done away with gendered identifiers for training staff. 
“The Army, Navy, and Coast Guard effectively de-emphasize gender in an integrated environment,” the report states. “Instead of saying ‘ma’am’ or ‘sir,’ recruits in these Services refer to their drill instructors using their ranks or roles followed by their last names. Gendered identifiers prime recruits to think about or visually search for a drill instructor’s gender first, before their rank or role.”

Moldova’s spy chief warned on Monday (19 December) of a “very high” risk of a new Russian offensive towards his country’s east next year and said Moscow still aimed to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. 
The comments by Alexandru Musteaţă, head of the Information and Security Service, echo recent messages out of Ukraine where top army generals have warned in recent days of the threat of a major new Russian offensive early next year. 
“The question is not whether the Russian Federation will undertake a new advance towards Moldova’s territory, but when it will do so,” Musteaţă told the TVR-Moldova television channel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of pro-Kremlin state media prediction that the U.S. support for Ukraine would die out, Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov became enraged when he saw an image of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris as they accepted and proudly held up the Ukrainian flag, The Daily Beast reports. 
As a guest was speaking, Solovyov reportedly was texting with producers, demanding that they remove the clip of Zelensky in the U.S. When the producers didn't react to his demands fast enough, he said, "Guys, get rid of this video, if you can’t read what is being written to you!”
“Zelensky is already on his way to Washington. It’s perhaps a natural path for any traitor... He betrayed his entire Soviet past,” he said. “Our weapon-makers are more talented anyway. Our men are more ingenious because we’re Russians—of many different nationalities. God is with us! Either we will win, or humanity will cease to exist, because the Lord won’t stand for the triumph of warriors of the Antichrist. We are the Lord’s weapon, we are his avenging right hand.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While investigating reports that Russian forces took children from two orphanages in Kherson, Ukraine, Sky News found CCTV footage that captured the moment Russians arrived to find the children.
The footage shows agents with Russia's secret police, the FSB, leading Russian soldiers through an orphanage. 
"They confiscated all the children's files," orphanage director Volodymyr Sahaidak told Sky News, "because they couldn't figure out where the children were, so they took files, they took computers, they took away the CCTV system because they wanted to know where the children had gone."
According to Sky News, no children were at the orphanage at the time because the community had heard the call from the orphanage to hide them. "The entire village rallied together to protect the children, taking them in, three or four per family. They ran the risk of collaborators exposing them to the Russians and being arrested or shot," Sky News' report stated.

The Russians never found the orphans, but sent another fifteen children from elsewhere in Ukraine for the orphanage to look after. Sky News has seen videos showing orphanage staff taking them in and treating them as their own. When the Russians finally retreated from the region, they came and took all 15 children with them.

Zelensky enjoyed a hero's welcome on a lightning trip on Wednesday in which US President Joe Biden committed nearly $1.8 billion in military supplies including, for the first time, the Patriot missile defense system.
"We can say with regret that so far neither President Biden nor President Zelensky have said even a few words that could be perceived as potential readiness to listen to Russia's concerns," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Officials in Moscow over recent months have repeatedly said they have not ruled out talks with Ukraine.
They have blamed the closure of diplomatic channels on Zelensky,…]]></summary>

Some GOP lawmakers, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), did not attend the speech, while Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and others did not stand up to applaud, although many Republicans expressed support for additional aid to Ukraine.
"I think behind the scenes there are discussions," McCaskill told "Morning Joe."

Western intelligence agencies believe the Russians have suffered casualties of more than 100,000 killed or wounded and that some of the most elite and best-equipped Russian military units have been destroyed. The collective morale and will of the Russian soldiers in Ukraine — and likely of the Russian military as a whole — has been severely degraded. A significant portion of the territory that the Russians captured during their initial invasion nine or 10 months ago has since been retaken by the Ukrainians.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday denounced psychological violence and abuse of power in the Church, as the case of a prominent priest accused of exploiting his authority to sexually abuse nuns has rocked the Vatican.
The 86-year-old pope made his comments in his annual Christmas address to cardinals, bishops and other members of the Curia, the central administration of the Vatican.
Francis has often used the occasion to decry perceived flaws in the top bureaucracy, such as gossip, cliques and infighting.
After mentioning wars, the pope said: "Besides the violence of arms, there is also verbal violence, psychological violence, the violence of the abuse of power, the hidden violence of gossip."

The 82-year-old "requires greater care related to renal and cardiac dysfunctions," said the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo.
It also reported a "progression" of his cancer, but said Pele was not in intensive care.
Considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time, Pele was hospitalized in Sao Paulo on November 29 for what his medical team called a re-evaluation of his chemotherapy treatments, which he has been receiving since having surgery to remove a colon tumor in September 2021.

KYIV (Reuters) - As Russian cruise missiles sped towards their target this month, a Ukrainian pilot gave chase in an old Soviet MiG-29 fighter jet and locked onto two of them, but could not take the shot: they were nearing a large town and it was too risky.
He said he passed the targets on to Ukraine's ground-based air defences which shot them down, as they have done hundreds of missiles since October, blunting the impact of a Russian air campaign that aims to destroy the country's power grid.
"Fortunately for us, they succeeded," the 29-year-old pilot, whose codename is Juice, told Reuters, describing the Dec. 5 incident.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States are considering staging their first large-scale joint live-fire demonstration in six years in 2023 amid North Korea's growing military threats, Seoul's defence ministry said on Thursday.
The drills have been floated as South Korea and the United States discuss preparations for the 70th anniversary of their alliance next year, ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha-gyu said.
"Marking that occasion, we are exploring various ways to showcase our military's presence and the alliance's overwhelming deterrence capabilities against North Korea," Jeon told a regular briefing.
"A combined joint live-fire demonstration can be one of the options."
The demonstration would be another joint display of force to be resumed following a years-long hiatus under new South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who pledged to bolster military capabilities and readiness to deter North Korea's weapons development.
On Tuesday, the United States flew its F-22 Raptor stealth fighters for joint drills with South Korea for the first time since 2018, hours after North Korea criticised both countries and vowed more missile tests.
In September, the allies staged their first exercises with a U.S. aircraft carrier since 2018.
Such exercises were halted under Yoon's predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who had prioritised engagement with the North, which denounced them as a rehearsal for invasion.
North Korea has tested an unprecedented number of missiles this year, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) designed to strike the U.S. mainland. It has also completed preparations for what would be its first nuclear test since 2017, Seoul and Washington officials said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The U.N. Security Council adopted its first resolution on Myanmar in 74 years on Wednesday to demand an end to violence and urge the military junta to release all political prisoners, including ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Myanmar has been in crisis since the army took power from Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1, 2021, detaining her and other officials and responding to pro-democracy protests and dissent with lethal force.
"Today we've sent a firm message to the military that they should be in no doubt - we expect this resolution to be implemented in full," Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said after the vote on the British-drafted resolution.

"Where Winston Churchill stood generations ago, so too will President Zelensky stand here today, not just as a president, but also as an ambassador of freedom itself," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the Ukrainian leader's address on Wednesday evening.

Multiple officials familiar with the effort told CNN the administration has authorized a task force to investigate the potential violations of stiff export control restrictions and sanctions intended to prevent Iran from obtaining those materials, whose presence in the drones was confirmed by UK-based investigative organization Conflict Armament Research.
That group examined several drones downed in Ukraine and determined that 82 percent of their components were manufactured by U.S.-based companies, including processors built by Texas Instruments and an engine built by an Austrian firm owned by Canada’s Bombardier Recreational Products.

Twenty-one people have died in countrywide unrest sparked by the ouster early this month of leftist Pedro Castillo, under whose tumultuous 16-month leadership Boluarte was vice president.
Six of the deaths were recorded in Apurimac, as Boluarte's own took a firm stand against her, marching in large numbers to demand fresh elections for a new president and Castillo's release despite a rash of corruption allegations.

The ceremony marks the start of the planting season on the island of Sulawesi, where the androgynous Bissu community to whom they belong once held divine status, but are now fighting against extinction.
Less than 40 Bissu remain in just a few areas across South Sulawesi, according to anthropologists, and they now perform cultural and shaman-like roles to prevent their traditions from dying.
Nani, a Bissu in their 60s who was born male, said they faced opposition from their family when they experienced a gender identity crisis as a child, but was now at peace with who they are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US leader Joe Biden and address Congress in Washington on Wednesday, a visit the White House said will send Russia a strong message of Western unity.
The secretly arranged trip comes on the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to meet his top military officials to assess the conflict in Ukraine and set goals for next year in what the Kremlin described as an "important, voluminous speech".
The visit will "underscore the United States' steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes," White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
It will be Zelensky's first trip outside Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February, when they planned for a rapid takeover of Kyiv and much of the country.

Orban is facing his biggest challenge since coming to power in 2010 as economic growth slows, Hungary's central bank interest rates are at the highest in the EU, and annual inflation is projected to reach around 26%-27% in the coming months. Orban said his government, which was re-elected for a fourth consecutive term in April 2022, wo...]]></summary>

BEIJING (Reuters) -Dozens of hearses queued outside a Beijing crematorium on Wednesday, even as China reported no new COVID-19 deaths in its growing outbreak, sparking criticism of its virus accounting as the capital braces for a surge of severe cases.
Following widespread protests, the country of 1.4 billion people this month began dismantling its "zero-COVID" regime of lockdowns and testing that had largely kept the virus away for three years - at great economic and psychological costs.
The abrupt change of policy has caught the country's fragile health system unprepared, with hospitals scrambling for beds and blood, pharmacies for drugs, and authorities racing to build special clinics. Experts now predict China could face more than a million COV…]]></summary>

MEXICO CITY/LIMA (Reuters) -Peru declared Mexico's ambassador to Lima "persona non grata" and ordered him to leave the country on Tuesday, Peru's foreign minister announced, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two nations after Peru ousted Pedro Castillo as president.
The abrupt order, a severe measure in the world of diplomacy, gives Mexico's envoy to the South American country just 72 hours to exit.
The Peruvian government's decision came hours after Mexico's top diplomat announced that his country had granted asylum to the family of Castillo, who faces rebellion charges from behind bars after attempting what critics have labeled a coup on Dec. 7.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fiji's parliament has delayed its first sitting, where it had been expected a new prime minister would be sworn in to the Pacific islands nation for the first time in 16 years.
People's Alliance leader Sitiveni Rabuka is expected to become prime minister, after three parties signed a coalition agreement on Tuesday after a hung election. The deal would dislodge Fiji First's Frank Bainimarama, who has led Fiji since a 2006 coup.
The constitution requires lawmakers to elect the prime minister from the parliament floor if no one party has won more than 50% of seats.
Fiji parliament's secretariat confirmed to Reuters in an email that parliament would not sit on Wednesday because Fiji's President Wiliame Katonivere has not yet issued a procla…]]></summary>

Despite promising a softer rule when they seized power last year, the Taliban have ratcheted up restrictions on all aspects of women’s lives, ignoring international outrage.
"You all are informed to immediately implement the mentioned order of suspending education of females until further notice," said a letter issued to all government and private universities, signed by the Minister for Higher Education, Neda Mohammad Nadeem.
The spokesman for the ministry, Ziaullah Hashimi, who tweeted the letter, confirmed the order in a text message to AFP.

Thousands of 16th to 18th century metal plaques, sculptures and objects -- hailed as some of the finest African art -- were ransacked by British forces from the ancient Kingdom of Benin and ended up in museums and art collections across the US and Europe.
Germany's return of part of the hundreds of bronzes it still holds comes as international momentum grows for the restoration of African artifacts from other former colonial powers Britain, France and Belgium.
German Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock travelled to Nigeria's capital Abuja to personally hand over the objects, which included figureheads and other artif…]]></summary>
