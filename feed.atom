        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[San Francisco (AFP) - A US jury on Wednesday ordered Meta to pay $174.5 million for violating live-streaming patents developed by a US Army veteran seeking to fix shortcomings in battlefield communications.
	

		A trial in Texas federal court ended with jurors deciding that "live" features at Facebook and Instagram used technology patented by Voxer, a company co-founded by Tom Katis, legal documents showed.
	

		"We believe the evidence at trial demonstrated that Meta did not infringe Voxer's patents," a company spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry.
	

		"We intend to seek further relief, including filing an appeal."
	

		Katis had reenlisted in the army after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and served as a Special Forces communications sergeant in Afghanistan, court filings said.
	

		When his combat unit was ambushed in Kunar province, he felt that the systems for coordinating reinforcements, medical evacuations and more "were ill-suited for time-sensitive communications with multiple groups in a highly disruptive environment," the complaint said.
	

		"Mr. Katis and his team began developing communications solutions in 2006 to remedy these shortcomings," his lawyers said.
	

		"The new technologies enabled transmission of voice and video communications with the immediacy of live communication and the reliability and convenience of messaging."
	

		Facebook approached San Francisco-based Voxer about potential collaboration after it launched a Walkie Talkie app in 2011, but no agreement was reached, according to legal documents.
	

		Instead, the lawsuit argued, Facebook went on to launch Facebook Live and Instagram Live, incorporating Voxer technology into the features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns it will be 'very challenging' to tame inflation without steep job losses across the US economy after hiking interest rates to 3.25% - the highest level since 2008 
* Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted on Wednesday that achieving a soft landing will be 'very challenging' 
* Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy rate 0.75 points to 3.25%, the highest since 2008 
* US central bank also projected rates will hit 4.4% this year and 4.6% in 2023 - higher than expected 
* Fed is attempting to cool down the economy to battle soaring inflation, which stands at 8.3% 
* Higher rates mean costlier borrowing, including mortgages and business loans, slowing growth 
* But by tamping down the economy, the Fed raises the risk of triggering job losses and layoffs 
The Federal Reserve has issued another super-sized increase to interest rates in a move intended to fight inflation, but which deepens the risk of a sharp economic downturn and job losses. 
At the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, the US central bank raised its policy rate by 75 basis points for the third time, to a range of 3 percent to 3.25 percent, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. 
The Fed is attempting to cool down the economy in order to tame rampant inflation, which remains stubbornly high at 8.3 percent -- but as interest rates climb, the path to a so-called 'soft landing' is narrowing.

Update #1: Fed attacks inflation with another big hike and expects more (AP)  
Update #2: Fed goes big with latest rate hike; Powell vows to 'keep at it' (Reuters)   
WNU Editor: Bottom line. Unemployment rates are going to climb in 2023. Expect more interest rate hikes, but only after the mid-term elections. And as for inflation, that mess is only going to get worse .... Fed-funds rate could end up as high as 5%, says overseer of $1.3 trillion in assets (Market Watch).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Reserve traveled rate by 75 basis points on September 21 and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has forecast another 125 basis point hike before the end of the year.  If that happens, it will take the benchmark rate to 4.4% by the end of the year, which is significantly higher than the June estimate of 3.8%.  The Fed has also hinted that it only expects rate cuts to be considered in 2024.
The expectation of higher rates pushed the 2-year Treasury note to 4.1%, its highest level since 2007. This could attract several investors seeking safety in this uncertain macro environment.  Higher rates are also likely to reduce the appeal of risky assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies and may delay the start of a new uptrend.

Neighbouring India, however, has failed to offer assistance, said Zardari, who condemned the country's government as "racist" and "Islamophobic".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Historically speaking when a country orders a military mobilization while fighting a war, its neighbors follow suit within a few hours if not days. But after Putin's announcement early today that he had ordered a partial mobilization, all that I have been hearing from the leaders of NATO and countries that border Russia is nothing but rhetoric denouncing this move (see above video). 
No calls to match Russia's partial mobilization. No calls to even declare a partial wartime industrial mobilization. Even Ukraine is silent on matching this Russian mobilization.

You can take this to the bank. 
If the West does nothing in the coming days to say that they will match Russia's mobilization efforts, this is going to cause panic in Ukraine that the West is now abandoning them. And in the eyes of the Kremlin, another example on how weak and ineffective the West has become. 
My prediction. 
The West (primarily the U.S.) will announce more troop deployments to eastern Europe, and more aid to Ukraine in the coming days. But it will fall short from what Ukraine needs, and it will certainly not match what Russia is going to do.]]></summary>

In a televised address on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of Russia's reservist forces to help boost the war effort in Ukraine.
The mobilization of these forces will serve to “protect our nation, its sovereignty and territorial integrity" as well as "ensure the security of our people and those in areas that have been liberated”, he said, the latter a reference to occupied areas of Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden accused Russia on Wednesday of making "reckless" and "irresponsible" threats to use nuclear weapons and said Moscow had violated the core tenets of United Nations membership by invading Ukraine.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Biden slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin for starting an unprovoked war that some 40 U.N. members were helping Ukraine fight through funding and weapons.
Earlier on Wednesday, Putin ordered a Russian mobilization to fight in Ukraine and made a thinly veiled threat to use nuclear weapons, in what NATO called a "reckless" act of desperation in the face of a looming Russian defeat.
Biden echoed that sentiment.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin committed to a partial military mobilization in a speech Wednesday, where he also threatened nuclear retaliation against the West. It was a sign of Putin’s willingness to escalate the war in Ukraine, as Kyiv’s successful counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region has recaptured territory and pushed back Russian front lines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAO PAULO (Reuters) - At least nine people have died after part of a warehouse near the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo collapsed on Tuesday, during a visit by two congressional candidates.
Congressional candidates Jones Donizette and Ely Santos were visiting Brazilian container company Multiteiner when part of a concrete structure inside the warehouse collapsed over them and company employees.
Donizette said in a Facebook post that he and Santos had both been rescued, but a local fire department said at least nine people had died in the collapse.
The fire department added that 31 people had been rescued and 28 of these taken to nearby hospitals, though a spokesperson said rescue teams believed there could still be more people trapped under the debris.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former White House adviser Peter Navarro has recommended that former President Donald Trump's next national security adviser be a man who once held a "rape Melania" sign at a rally.
Politico correspondent Meridith McGraw noted on Wednesday that Navarro's included a list of potential members of a second Trump administration.

 
In his book, titled, "Taking Back Trump's America," Navarro suggests Gov. Ron DeSantis or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for vice president.
Under his plan, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro would be Attorney General and Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo would take the job of press secretary.
He asked Trump to consider right-wing activist Jack Posobiec for the position of National Security Adviser. 
In 2017, Posobiec reportedly tried to discredit liberal protesters by showing up to an event with a "rape Melania" sign, according to BuzzFeed News. He also pushed the false QAnon "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory that accused Hillary Clinton of running a sex trafficking ring from a restaurant.]]></summary>

Ukraine says Moscow’s move is ‘predictable’ as it is failing to achieve its objectives in the seven-month-old war. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a partial military mobilisation in Russia for the seven-month-old war in Ukraine, warning it is “not a bluff”. 
In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday, Putin said he was defending Russian territories and that the West wanted to destroy the country. 
He said Russia would use all the means at its disposal to protect its territory. 
Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu told state media that Putin’s decree would see 300,000 additional personnel called up to serve in Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine.

“This investigation of the 45th president of the United States is unprecedented and misguided,” James Trusty and Christopher Kise, attorneys for Trump, wrote in their response.  “In what is at its core a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control, the government unfairly seeks to criminalize the 45th president’s possession of his own presidential and personal records.”

Aerial images showed a devastating scene of dozens of black glossy mammals strewn across a long beach, stuck on the waterline where the frigid southern ocean meets the sand.
Locals covered survivors with blankets and doused them with buckets of water to keep them alive, as other whales nearby tried in vain to twitch free and yet more lay dead.
The whales were "stranded near Macquarie Harbour" said the state's Department of Natural Resources and Environment.
"It appears about half of the animals are alive."
Officials said marine conservation experts and staff with whale rescue gear were en route to the scene.

Julien Bayou was "suspended from his role" as co-president of the Greens' bloc in the National Assembly (lower house), the party said late Tuesday, after he was accused of psychologically abusing an ex-partner.
"We are a feminist party, and so we place ourselves at the service of women's testimony... we acknowledged that the only way to show we weren't pretending and weren't hiding was a temporary suspension," Sandra Regol, vice-president of the Green MPs' group, told broadcaster Franceinfo on Wednesday.

Both Russian president Vladimir Putin and Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu delivered speeches on Wednesday in the wake of announcements by the Donbass Republics as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions that they are planning to hold votes on joining Russia on September 23-27. 
In his TV address on Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that Russia was at war with the collective West rather than Ukraine.   
"In reality, we are fighting the collective West plus NATO. When we speak about it, we mean not only the weapons being supplied [to Kiev] in huge batches, but also about systems of communication and information processing systems,” Shoigu said.

Now, the 78-year-old Oscar-winner behind "The Name of the Rose," "Seven Years in Tibet" and "Enemy at the Gates" is returning to Tinseltown with his latest film, "Notre-Dame On Fire" ("Notre-Dame Brule") -- a thriller about the real-life blaze at the beloved cathedral in Paris.
Annaud spoke to AFP via phone from France's capital as organizers of next month's The American French Film Festival (TAFFF) announced Tuesday that his movie will be their opening night Los Angeles gala premiere.
"I'm close to Notre-Dame now and far away from Los Angeles. But part of my heart remains in Los Angeles," said Annaud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, warning the West that if it continued what he called its "nuclear blackmail" that Moscow would respond with the might of all its vast arsenal.
"If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we use all available means to protect our people - this is not a bluff," Putin said in a televised address to the nation.
Putin said he had signed a decree on a partial mobilisation, which significantly escalates the conflict.
Putin said his aim was to "liberate" east Ukraine's Donbas region, and that most people in the regions under Russian control did not want to be ruled by Kyiv.

Sputnik: China's Russian LNG Import Value Tripled in 2022 as Beijing Acts as Middleman to Sanctioning Nations 
Since the start of 2022, China has signed major deals with Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others to dramatically increase its importing and processing of petroleum products, including crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), as well as coal. 
According to newly released customs data, China increased its LNG imports from only two countries so far in 2022 - Qatar and Russia, the latter of which nearly tripled from 2021 numbers. At the same time, China’s LNG exports have increased, in part to offset the economic effects of Omicron-driven lockdowns.   
According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), which viewed the data, the value of LNG coming to China from Russia via pipelines in the first eight months of 2022 was nearly triple that seen in the previous year, amounting to $2.39 billion. In terms of volume, China’s overall LNG imports from Russia increased by 28.5% year-on-year; for imports from Qatar, they increased by 66.7%, or two-thirds.

How we got to an $850 billion Pentagon budget  
Situation The Senate might vote on the fiscal year 2023 military budget this month. Or it might not; nobody’s sure. What’s for certain is that the bill the Senate considers will have at least as much as $850 billion for the Pentagon. In other words, we’re staring down a $72 billion year-to-year increase in military spending with this legislation: The FY2022 version of the same bill (National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA) licensed $778 billion for the Pentagon.   
How we got to an $850 billion Pentagon budget 
In March, Joe Biden proposed increasing annual military spending by $35 billion—to $813 billion—as part of his FY2023 budget request. In June, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) added another $37 billion on top of that before advancing the $850 billion bill to the House floor for approval.

The State Department announced in August that it will no longer publish World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) reports, which have been released by the US government since the 1960s. 
The WMEATs detail US global military spending, arms transfers, and related data for each country in the world. 
The 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) included an amendment that repealed a 1994 provision requiring the State Department to publish a WMEAT each year.

“I assume that from the phase of a special military operation we are approaching a major war, and now the question is where are the borders and whether we will go after some time, maybe in a month or two, into a major world conflict the likes of which we haven’t had since World War II,” he said.

* Russian stocks plunged Tuesday on signs that Moscow may escalate its war on Ukraine. 
* Lawmakers are advancing legislation to heighten punishments for military crimes, raising fears of full mobilization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: REVEALED: President Biden was 14 rows back at the Queen's funeral because precedent demanded Commonwealth leaders and world royalty took closest seats 
* President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill sat 14 rows back in Westminster Abbey amid Queen Elizabeth's funeral 
* Biden was sat behind the President of Poland Andrzej Duda, while Jill was sat next to president of Switzerland 
* Their positioning raised eyebrows, but it has been revealed it is due to how royal protocol ranks world leaders 
* The couple left London for the United States just two hours after the service finished on Monday afternoon 
A quirk of royal protocol meant that US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were sat 14 rows back in Westminster Abbey at the Queen's funeral yesterday. 
There were raised eyebrows when Mr Biden and his wife were placed seven rows from the back in a service attended by around 2,000 world leaders, royals and foreign dignitaries. 
After arriving at the funeral in his motorcade while other world leaders took the bus, the leader of the free world was then placed behind Polish President Andrzej Duda.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The Polish President was placed in front of President Biden. So much for the argument that protocol dictated where President Biden and the First Lady were seated. 
But the person who was really snubbed at the Queen's state funeralwas Prince Harry, even though the argument can be made that he helped cause it .... Prince Harry's uniform snub, invitation row and lonely flight to Balmoral (Mirror).]]></summary>

WNU Editor: From CNBC .... Russian President Vladimir Putin failed for unknown reasons to deliver a nationally televised speech that would have been his first since the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. 
Putin has postponed the speech, which was expected to discuss the situation in Ukraine, until Wednesday, according to a Telegram post by Sergei Markov, a former advisor to the Russian leader, 
"Go to sleep,” wrote Margarita Simonyan, the editor of RT, a Russian state media outlet, on her own Telegram account. 
A lot happened today. 
French President Macron tried to talk to President Putin today but he was rebuffed. German Chancellor said Germany will not recognize the results of these referendums. Belarus President has ordered the country to be prepared for the worse. 
My sources in Ukraine tell me that the Kyiv government is furious with these referendums. That they will do everything in their power to disrupt them. Expect heavy fighting to break-out along the entire front this week.]]></summary>

Russia's President Putin is set to give a major speech Tuesday evening (Moscow time) amid announcements by pro-Russian authorities in occupied regions of Ukraine that referendums to join the Russian Federation will be held in the coming days. 
Russian media is reporting within the last hours (machine translation): "President Vladimir Putin may speak on Tuesday, September 20, regarding referendums in the territories of the LPR, DPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. RBC was told about this by three sources close to the presidential administration. The speech is expected before the end of the day, what exactly the head of state will say is unknown to RBC's interlocutors." 
There are reports that Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu will also be by Putin's side, leading some pundits to speculate we are about to see a possible formal declaration of war and "national mobilization" of Russian society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: German Producer Prices Post Surprise Record Jump in August 
BERLIN (Reuters) -German producer prices rose in August at their strongest rate since records began both in annual and monthly terms, driven mainly by soaring energy prices, raising the chances that headline inflation will surge even higher. 
Producer prices of industrial products increased by 45.8% on the same month last year, the Federal Statistical Office reported on Tuesday. Compared to July 2022, prices rose 7.9%, it added. 
The surge was considerably stronger than expected, with analysts having forecast a 37.1% year-on-year rise and a 1.6% monthly rise, according to a Reuters poll. 
In July, the year-on-year increase had been 37.2% and in June 32.7%. 
Energy prices in August on average were over double the same period last year, up 139%, and 20.4% higher than the previous month, the office reported.

But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only making Europe stronger, Spanish PM tells POLITICO.

With maximum winds nearing 115 miles (185 kilometers) per hour, the storm is already bringing hurricane conditions to the British overseas territory and is expected to become even stronger, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
"Heavy rains around the center of Fiona impacts the Turks and Caicos through this afternoon with continued life-threatening flooding," the NHC said in an advisory, adding that the storm was expected to pass near the island chain within hours.

Breaking Defense: Congress should stop the Air Force from retiring F-22s  
As China looms, the Heritage Foundation's JV Venable argues for saving 33 F-22s from the chopping block. 
As the Air Force tries to balance long-term strategy with short-term budgets, it plans to slice some F-22s from the already slender fleet to help pay for next generation platforms. In the below op-ed, however, The Heritage Foundation’s JV Venable argues that’s a mistake the Air Force can’t afford to make in today’s perilous geopolitical environment. 
The F-22 Raptor is an amazing aircraft. Its stealth faculties, coupled with its unmatched maneuvering and super cruise capabilities, make it the most dominant air-to-air fighter in the world. Yet, the Air Force wants to retire 33 of these jets because upgrading them would cost money they’d rather use to develop future systems. 
It is a false choice, and in the face of growing threats from America’s adversaries, Congress needs to act to stop the retirement.

It is the earliest known evidence of human opium use, according to a statement released on Tuesday by Tel Aviv University, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Israel Antiquities Authority.

"This exciting discovery confirms historical writings and archaeological hypotheses according to which opium and its trade played a central role in the cultures of the Near East," the joint statement said.
The vessels, some of which were made in Cyprus and some locally, resembled an opium poppy capsule in shape, according to the statement.]]></summary>

Myanmar has been in chaos since the military seized power in a coup in February last year, with nearly 2,300 civilians killed in a crackdown on dissent according to a local monitoring group.
The Sagaing region in the country's northwest has seen some of the fiercest fighting, and amid clashes between anti-coup fighters and the military, entire villages have been burned down.
The UN children's agency UNICEF condemned Friday's incident in Depeyin township in Sagaing.
"On 16 September, at least 11 children died in an air strike and indiscriminate fire in civilian areas," UNICEF said in a statement issued Monday.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As flies buzz over his tiny body, two-year-old Sadak Ibrahim barely whimpers, too weak to cry or shoo them away -- a heartbreaking glimpse of the hunger crisis gripping Somalia.
The Horn of Africa nation is on the brink of a second famine in just over a decade, enduring its worst drought in 40 years after failed rainy seasons since late 2020 wiped out crops and livestock.
With a fifth monsoon forecast to fail, the United Nations warned this month that time was running out to save lives as it urged donors to contribute more to the relief effort.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the situation was worse than the 2011 famine when 260,000 people died in the country, more than half of them children under the age of six.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SpaceX will apply for an exemption from US sanctions against Iran in a bid to offer its satellite internet service to the country, owner Elon Musk said on Monday.
"Starlink will apply for an exemption from sanctions against Iran," Musk said in response to a tweet from a science reporter.
Musk had initially announced that the Starlink satellite internet service had been made available on every continent -- "including Antarctica" -- with the company planning to launch up to 42,000 satellites to boost connectivity.
Iranian-born science journalist Erfan Kasraie had said on Twitter that bringing the service to Iran could be a "real game changer for the future" of the country, which elicited Musk's response. 
Launched at the end of 2020, Starlink offers high-speed broadband service to customers in areas poorly served by fixed and mobile terrestrial networks through a constellation of satellites in low earth orbit. 
The service received notoriety after supplying antennas and modems to the Ukrainian military to improve its communications capabilities in its war with Russia.
Starlink is monetized through the purchase of antennas, modems and subscriptions with rates that vary by country. 
Nearly 3,000 Starlink satellites have been deployed since 2019 and SpaceX is conducting about one launch a week, using its own Falcon 9 rockets to speed up its deployment.
Iran has been under a tightened US sanctions regime since former president Donald Trump terminated a 2015 agreement over its nuclear activities. 
While current President Joe Biden supports a renegotiation of the deal, Iranian insistence on long-term guarantees from Washington has stalled discussions. 
New rounds of sanctions were imposed on Iran this month after a Tehran-based company helped ship drones to Russia, and in response to a massive cyberattack targeting Albania in July allegedly carried out by Iran's intelligence ministry.

Whistleblowers were alarmed that the kingdom would use the technology for nuclear weapons and alerted Congress to the secret negotiations, resulting in a Congressional investigation. The White House did not cooperate with the investigation or share any requested documents.
But the House Oversight Committee obtained more than 60,000 pages of texts, emails, corporate memos and reports that offered a vivid look at how dangerous the Middle East could have …]]></summary>

A top Chinese official has expressed support for Russia’s war in Ukraine during his visit to Moscow, apparently believing it was a closed-door meeting. But the Kremlin released the footage to make his remarks known to the entire world.

Li met with Putin in Vladivostok and later with Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the State Duma, and Valentina Matviyenko, chairwoman of the Federation Council, in Moscow, along with leaders of the five political parties of the State Duma.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 28,000 prisoners including murderers, violent sexual criminals and those guilty of grievous bodily harm have been freed from jails to fight for Vladimir Putin in his war in Ukraine, it is claimed. The scheme has so far led to the release of more than five percent of the entire male prison population in Russia as the Kremlin steps up recruitment of inmates after suffering a humiliating defeat against Ukraine 's army in the east of the country.   
Daily Mail: More than 28,000 prisoners including murderers, rapists and thugs - one in 20 of Russia's entire jail population - have been freed to fight in Ukraine 
* One in 20 Russian prisoners offered freedom deal to fight for Putin in Ukraine 
* They must survive six months on the front lines in exchange for a pardon 
* Oligarch behind the Wagner Group PMC seen in video making prison sales pitch 
* Soldiers are expected to blow themselves up than surrender and deserters shot 
* Recruitment stepped up after disastrous Russian losses in east of Ukraine 
More than 28,000 prisoners including murderers, rapists and those guilty of grievous bodily harm have been freed from jails to fight for Vladimir Putin in his war in Ukraine, it is claimed. 
The scheme has so far led to the release of more than five percent of the entire male prison population in Russia as the Kremlin steps up recruitment of inmates after suffering a humiliating defeat against Ukraine's army in the east of the country.
The astonishing figure - revealed by independent Volya Telegram channel - is far higher than previous estimates of released prisoners fighting for Russia in Ukraine.

WNU editor: Ukraine says they are fighting prisoners .... Ukraine Soldiers Say They Are Fighting Prisoners, Not Soldiers (VOA). U.S. officials say many are refusing .... Russian mercenaries want felons to go fight Putin's war in Ukraine, but many are refusing, US official says (Insider). As to what is my take. I am surprised that they got 5% of the Russian prison population to commit.]]></summary>

The Guardian: Germany’s Die Linke on verge of split over sanctions on Russia 
Leftwing party’s future in balance after series of resignations, as former co-leader calls coalition ‘stupidest government in Europe’ 
Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing party’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. 
The German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats.

WNU Editor: If Die linke (The Left) leaves the coalition, the German government will collapse (see distribution of Bundestag seats here). And while I do not think this is going to happen right now, I would not be surprised that if economic conditions worsen in the winter months and protests mount, we may see the German government fracture and fall apart.

CBC/Reuters: Moscow summons Canada envoy, says Russian Embassy was attacked in Ottawa 
Russia's Foreign Ministry says unknown person unsuccessfully threw Molotov cocktail onto the embassy grounds 
Russia's Foreign Ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian Embassy in Ottawa, the ministry said on Monday. 
It said an unknown person threw a Molotov cocktail onto the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Ottawa. It also said  "aggressive" demonstrators had blocked an entrance to the consular section of the embassy. 
Russian Ambassador to Canada Oleg Stepanov was quoted in Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik on Monday as saying that the bottle was thrown early on the morning of Sept. 12 but didn't ignite. The embassy should have a permanent police presence, he is quoted as saying.

WNU Editor: I am surprised .... stunned really .... that there is no permanent police presence outside the embassy. Canada has a large Ukrainian and Russian immigrant population, and tensions between the two sides are the worse that I have ever seen. 
My own church is thinking of hiring security because of threats that only got worse when the Canadian government imposed sanctions on the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in July .... Canada Imposes Sanctions On The Head Of The Russian Orthodox Church (July 10, 2022).

The Taliban have released a US engineer they had held hostage since 2020 in exchange for an Afghan tribal leader held in US custody since 2005. 
Mark Frerichs was handed over at Kabul airport on Monday, the Taliban said.  In return they received Bashir Noorzai, a Taliban ally serving a life sentence for drug trafficking. 
US President Joe Biden said that the swap required "difficult decisions" that he did not take lightly. 
Mr Frerichs, 60, was abducted by the Taliban the year before the group swept back to power in Afghanistan and its Western-backed government collapsed. 
He had been living and working in Kabul as a civil engineer for 10 years. 
Mr Frerich's sister, Charlene Cakora, said the family had never given up hope of getting him back.

“We’re coming to a point right now where I think Putin is going to have to revise what his objectives are for this operation,” Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier said. 
He also emphasized that it is now quite clear that Putin "is not going to be able to do what he initially intended to do."  “He’s coming to a decision point,” Berrier said.

Update: US Military Intel Chief Says Putin Can't Achieve Ukraine Goal (VOA/AP)   
WNU Editor: I think Putin's objectives will remain the same. What will be different is how will he achieve them. Last week's missile strikes on civilian infrastructure tells me that Russia will soon be targeting civilian infrastructure such as electricity, communication, water, and rail/bridge networks.

Such an upgrade will mean pouring in more resources into the war, as well as expanding the target list for the military.]]></summary>
