        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: US and Philippines begin largest-ever drills after China exercises 
The US and the Philippines are holding their largest-ever joint military drills a day after China concluded large-scale exercises around Taiwan. 
Over three days, China's military rehearsed blockades of Taiwan in response to the island's leader meeting the US House Speaker last week. 
Washington criticised China's display of firepower as disproportionate, while Taiwan President Tsai said it was "irresponsible" and she had the right to make visits to the US. 
The US drills had been earlier planned.

Filipino and US officials say the drills show their commitment to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region that is open and free. 
Washington announced last month that their annual Balikatan exercise with the Philippines would be their largest ever - involving more than 17,000 troops, including 12,000 from the US.

Relatives were still recovering the charred bodies and limbs of victims killed in a military airstrike on a village in central Myanmar Wednesday, a day after one of the deadliest attacks since the junta seized power in a coup two years ago. 
An eyewitness, who hid in a tunnel during the attack, described a scene of horror as he approached the site of the military airstrike – of children dying, women screaming, and bodies heaped on the ground. 
At least 133 people, including women and children, were killed after Myanmar’s military junta bombed Kanbalu township in the central Sagaing region on Tuesday, the human rights minister of the ousted shadow National Unity Government Aung Myo Min told CNN.

New York Times: A leaked document outlines four ‘wild card’ scenarios in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
A secret intelligence document obtained by The New York Times that was among those leaked on the internet this year provides insight into planning for contingencies one year into the war in Ukraine. 
The analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency outlines four “wild card” scenarios and how they could affect the course of the conflict in Ukraine. The hypothetical scenarios include the deaths of Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the removal of leadership within the Russian Armed Forces and a Ukrainian strike on the Kremlin.

WNU Editor: Here is my take on these four "wild card" scenarios.

The death of Putin will only mean the ascension of a hardcore leader. That person will probably be Patrushev Nikolai. 
If Zelensky should die. It is hard to say who will replace him. There will be many contenders to that job, but all of them will continue Zelensky's war policies and strategies. 
I do not see the complete removal of the Russian military leadership happening anytime soon. Certainly not in the middle of a war. 
The scenario that I do see happening is a Ukrainian military strike on the Kremlin. But this will only escalate the war, and it will also change Russian rules of engagement to now directly target the Ukrainian leadership. 
My biggest fear/scenario is that Ukraine uses a dirty bomb that will make Red Square and the area surrounding the Kremlin a no-go to place for generations. In this nightmare scenario Russia will respond with nuclear weapons against Ukraine, and will launch conventional military strikes against NATO military sites that are providing intelligence/logistical/and hardware support for Ukraine's war efforts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Son Of The New American Revolution: Looking At the U.S. and NATO Presence in Ukraine — Is That All There Is? 
This document, based on what you see, appears to be Unclassified. If there is a classification marking in the upper right hand corner, it is obscured. As you can see, it primarily provides a summary of the Composition & Disposition of the U.S. forces — air, maritime and soldiers — in the European theater. There are 92,000 U.S. military personnel in the European AOR (i.e., Aera of Operations), but they are not in Ukraine. 
The image also shows the US/NATO Special Operations Forces in Ukraine (you can read Jim Hoft’s report on this here) and the total US presence in Ukraine, which is 100 persons. According to the image of the document published on Twitter, the Department of State has more people in Ukraine than the Department of Defense. There are 71 people listed as State Department (i.e., DoS) and 29 military personnel. Of those 29, 14 are SOF aka Special Operations Forces. the remaining 15 consist of the Defense Attache (DAO), personnel with the Office of Defense Cooperation (essentially traffic cops handling the flow of U.S. military aid to Ukraine) and the Marine Security Augmentation Unit (MSAU), which provides security for U.S. diplomatic facilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OilPrice.com: Turkey Says Its Black Sea Natural Gas Discoveries Are Worth Over $500 Billion 
The volumes of natural gas that Turkey has found so far in the Black Sea are worth in excess of $500 billion, Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Dönmez told broadcaster CNN Türk. 
The huge gas finds would be enough to supply all households in the country for 35 years, or to cover total Turkish natural gas consumption, including from industry, for 15 to 20 years, the minister added. 
Last week, Turkish Petroleum (TPAO) said on Twitter that the installation of the pipes connecting the energy base in the Black Sea to the Sakarya Gas Field Land Facility had been successfully completed. The company said the inauguration of the start of the gas transmission from the field is expected to take place on April 20 in the presence of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Washington Post: Russia moves to tighten conscription law, pressing more men to fight 
RIGA, Latvia — When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a mobilization in the fall to commandeer reinforcements for the war against Ukraine, thousands of men fled the country or went into hiding. But tough new measures approved by Russia’s lower house of parliament on Tuesday will make it almost impossible for Russians to dodge conscription in the future. 
The law provides for electronic military summonses with bans on draftees leaving the country, making it possible to quietly sweep up thousands more men to fight — even as the Kremlin is denying plans for a controversial new mobilization. 
The State Duma, which is the lower chamber, approved the legislation with just one abstention. The upper house, the Federation Council, is expected to adopt it Wednesday, and send it on to Putin for his approval, which is widely expected.

Armed Forces Press: U.S. General: Russia Jamming American GPS Satellite Signals Used By Ukraine 
According to a top general in the U.S. Space Force, Russia has taken to using space weapons in its war against Ukraine. Russian forces have been jamming GPS signals from American satellites that are used by Ukrainian troops. 
Despite jamming signals from the satellites, Moscow has not yet attempted to destroy any of them, and one expert believes it's because Russia's space capabilities are not yet completely developed and would not survive a conflict with a major world power. 
Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, Chief of Space Operations for the U.S. Space Force, has confirmed that Russia has Earth-based lasers capable of attacking satellites along with electronic jamming equipment and anti-satellite missiles. 
"They have shown no qualms about testing these systems," Saltzman said on April 5 during a forum on space defense that was held by the Mitchell Institute of Aerospace Studies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Patriotic badges showing Winnie the Pooh being punched in the face by a Taiwanese black bear -- a humorous dig at China's leader Xi Jinping -- have gone viral across the self-ruled island.
The iron-on patches being worn by some of Taiwan's air force pilots are a defiant message to Xi, who is often satirized for looking like the honey-loving cartoon bear.
Chen Kai-chu, another fan, said: "Wear this to go through Chinese customs."
China, which claims the island as part of its territory, launched three days of massive war games on Saturday that involved simulating attacks on democratic Taiwan.
The show of force from Beijing was a response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week.

The Shiveluch volcano erupted just after midnight reaching a crescendo about six hours later, spewing out an ash cloud over an area of 108,000 square kilometres (41,699 square miles), according to the Kamchatka Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Geophysical Survey.
Lava flows tumbled from the volcano, melting snow and prompting a warning of mud flows along a nearby highway while villages were carpeted in drifts of grey ash as deep as 8.5 centimetres, the deepest in 60 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cuba's government on Monday announced a surprise lifting of its ban on US dollar deposits in banks, reversing a policy which had been in place across the communist island nation since June 2021.
"From this moment on, financial and banking institutions will accept cash deposits of US dollars in bank accounts," said a Central Bank of Cuba (BCC) resolution published Monday in the country's Official Gazette.
The Cuban government had announced the ban almost two years ago, saying at the time that the move was due to continuing difficulties caused by the ongoing US embargo.
The policy reversal comes as the island faces its worst economic crisis in three decades, with mounting shortages of food, medicines and fuel worsening in recent weeks.
However it is also seeing its vital tourism industry pick up following a collapse during the pandemic, which the government cited as one of the reasons for the move on Monday.
Cuba has been subject to broad US sanctions since 1962, hindering its government's ability to transact in dollars.
After a relative easing under the presidency of Barack Obama, sanctions were ramped up during Donald Trump's tenure in the White House. During his administration's final days in office in January 2021, the United States added Cuba back to its list of state sponsors of terrorism.
That designation occurred the same month that Cuba's government moved to end its parallel currencies, phasing out a convertible peso that was pegged to the dollar, leaving only the regular, weaker peso, or CUP.
Since then, the currency has fallen from 24 to an official rate of 120 to the dollar. On the black market, the rate is 185.
Trump's successor Joe Biden has kept up the prior administration's restrictions on Cuba, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken in March said the United States had no plans to lift the state sponsor of terrorism designation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Investigations of leaked Pentagon documents take shape as DOJ probes source of leak  
Washington CNN  — The US government investigations into a leak of highly classified Pentagon documents are starting to take shape, with the Pentagon examining how the leak impacts US national security and the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into who may have been behind the breach. 
The interagency probe is being led by the Pentagon’s Office of Intelligence and Security, according to three US officials, and could take months to complete. It will chiefly examine whether any sources and methods have been compromised since the documents, many of which are marked Top Secret, were posted on a social media platform earlier this year. 
Milancy Harris, the deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, will be in charge of the effort on the Pentagon side, officials said. The investigation will also try to determine the scope of the leak, since officials do not yet know whether it has been contained or whether there are more classified documents still circulating online.

Here is what we know and do not know about what appears to be the gravest leak of U.S. secrets in years:
ARE THE DOCUMENTS REAL?
U.S. officials believe most of the materials are genuine. Some, however, appear to have been altered to show inflated U.S. estimates for Ukrainian battlefield casualties since Russia invaded in February 2022, as well as understated numbers for Russian forces.
It is unclear which of the documents might have been salted with misinformation and if they could be part of a Russian misinformation operation or a U.S. sch…]]></summary>

Russian President Vladimir Putin's popularity in the United States has reached its highest point since 2020, years before his troops invaded Ukraine, according to new data. 
The Kremlin leader's popularity among Americans, as of the first quarter of 2023, stands at 21 percent, according to pollster YouGov. In the first quarter of 2021, Putin's popularity hovered at 15 percent, and shortly after Russia began the war with Ukraine, it was registered at 17 percent. 
Moscow's troops crossing into Ukraine in February 2022 was met with condemnation from Western countries, including the U.S. At the time, President Joe Biden said the Kremlin had "chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering."

Zero Hedge: 'No Business In The Public Domain': Kirby Warns Journalists Not To Report On Leaked Pentagon Documents 
Biden administration and National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressed the media on Monday, asking in so many words that pretty please would journalists not report on the trove of highly classified documents which were leaked online. 
"This is information that has no business in the public domain... It has no business... on the front pages of newspapers or on television." But Kirby is a bit late, given already days ago major outlets from the NY Times to Washington Post to foreign outlets like The Guardian and RT have widely reported on them. They classified reports have circulated widely on English-language and foreign social media as well.

CNBC: IMF cuts GDP forecasts, says global economy heading for weakest growth since 1990 
* The IMF said that five years from now, global growth is expected to be around 3% — the lowest medium-term forecast in a World Economic Outlook for over 30 years. 
* In the short term, the fund expects global growth of 2.8% this year and 3% in 2024, slightly below the fund’s estimates published in January.

Washington Post: Macron's Taiwan comments anger allies, delight Beijing

 After weeks of protests over an unpopular pension overhaul plan at home, the French president now faces outrage from allies abroad over his chummy trip to China and remarks on the need for Europe to stand apart from the United States on Taiwan and other issues. 
The visit and its aftermath have angered politicians and analysts on both sides of the Atlantic, highlighting gaps between the U.S. and French approach to China, showcasing division within the Eropean Union — and probably delighting Beijing. 
The interview in question took place during a three-day visit to China that raised eyebrows for its surprisingly upbeat tone, considering that Beijing has yet to condemn Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Daily Mail: Major volcano eruption sends ash cloud 12 miles into the sky threatening aircraft and turning day to night in 'doomsday scenes' in eastern Russia 
* The Shiveluch volcano erupted just after midnight in the Kamchatka Peninsula

One of Russia's most active volcanoes has erupted, shooting a vast cloud of ash far up into the sky and smothering villages in drifts of grey volcanic dust.

WNU Editor: This is a major event that is going to impact everyone. In the Northern hemisphere temperatures are going to drop significantly in the coming months, and may last 2 to 3 years. Expect a shorter growing season and lower crop yields. This of course will mean higher food and energy prices.

        <updated>2023-04-11T04:44:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Thick sandstorms will hit Beijing and several provinces through Wednesday, and Chinese forecasters have advised citizens of respiratory dangers and very low visibility while travelling, state media reported.
The capital Beijing has seen regular air pollution and an unseasonal number of sandstorms over the past few weeks.
Forecasters issued a blue weather alert warning for sandstorms. China has a four-tier, color-coded weather-warning system, with red representing the most severe warning and blue the least severe.
On Tuesday morning, smog and misty grey clouds could be seen enveloping Beijing and the city's real-time air quality index was at a serious pollution level, according to the website of the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.
The concentration of fine particulates in the air in Beijing is currently 46.2 times the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline value, according to IQAir, a website that issues air quality data and information.
A dozen provinces, including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Hubei, Inner Mongolia and metropolis Shanghai, will be affected by sandstorms and major dust until 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) Wednesday, the Central Meteorological Observatory said.
The sandstorms were again a hot dicussion topic on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, racking up 2.178 million chats.
One user wrote, "What! When I wake up, why doesn't anyone issue a holiday notice, do you still have to go to work in the dust today!"
Beijing has regular sandstorms in March and April as it is near the large Gobi desert.
A Chinese government official at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recently said the number of sandstorms was now four times higher than in the 1960s, a consequence of rising temperatures and lower precipitation in the deserts of north China and neighbouring Mongolia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) -A possible intelligence leak by the United States was a "serious" incident, Angus Campbell, the chief of Australia's Defence Force, said on Tuesday, adding that the U.S. was engaging with its partners to understand the consequences.
Three U.S. officials have said national security agencies are reviewing how they share their most sensitive secrets inside the government and tackling the diplomatic fallout from the release of dozens of confidential documents.
"The issue of maintaining security of information is critical to the development of national capability and to the trust and confidence across allies and partners," Campbell said in response to questions after a speech at the Lowy Institute.
Asked if Australia had a role in any future conflict over Taiwan, Campbell said, "Anything that undermines the security, stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region in which we live is of interest to Australia."
He added, "The question then might arise what particular circumstance or scenario enlivens what form of interest and in what form of response."
The war in Ukraine showed that there was no way to predict how any war would unfold, Campbell said.
"I encourage all parties to areas of international tension to find other ways to resolve that tension ... A stable secure free and open Indo-Pacific for all nations is in Australia's interest."

Republicans suggest everything from terrorist labels to an invasion to decimate drug cartels in Mexico. 
A growing number of prominent Republicans are rallying around the idea that to solve the fentanyl crisis, America must bomb it away.
In recent weeks, Donald Trump has discussed sending “special forces” and using “cyber warfare” to target cartel leaders if he’s reelected president and, per Rolling Stone, asked for “battle plans” to strike Mexico. Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) introduced a bill seeking authorization for the use of military force to “put us at war with the cartels.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said he is open to sending U.S. troops into Mexico to target drug lords even without that nation’s permission. And lawmakers in both chambers have filed legislation to label some cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move supported by GOP presidential aspirants.

The Guardian: ‘They’re starting to die’: fears Ukraine’s drone supremacy may soon be over

 
Frontline drone operators say Russia is close to countering their most popular models – setting off a race to find replacements 
Crouching in a freezing basement or risking it all on top of a nine-storey building, the drone squads in the war zone of Bakhmut are ubiquitous. Some are forced to lurk a few hundred metres from, or even on, the frontline. Without them, Ukraine’s efforts to hold on to the embattled city would be much harder, perhaps impossible. 
But the concern for Ukraine, according to three frontline drone operators deployed in the city over the winter, is that the Russians are close to countering the most popular models in operation, those made by the Chinese manufacturer DJI. “They’re adept and they are manufacturing these special jamming systems,” said Yaroslav, 31.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says he hopes the comments emerging from Emmanuel Macron on the topic of Ukraine “don’t prove damaging” to trans-Atlantic relations.

“I hope the comments don’t prove damaging, they do point to attitudes and approaches that at times are of concern in terms of not realising the challenges that are faced in relation to China’s efforts over a period of time to bend and push against the rules-based order in different ways,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia.

“The establishment of military operations in the South China Sea, the of course, undermining of human rights in a number of areas … trade-based economic coercion in breach of WTO rules against Australia, these are all serious issues and an important point for any leader of a democratic nation to be mindful of is the need for us all to work together in defence of our values.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jerusalem Post: Iran kickstarts multi-front Middle East war against Israel - analysis 
The Islamic Republic's proxies and allies appear to have begun a multi-front conflict with Israel over the past week. 
A week of attacks on Israel, including rockets fired from Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, represents the manifestation of an Iranian strategy to confront Israel with multiple threats on different fronts. Although different groups may be behind the attacks from those places, these groups are likely all linked to Iran. The groups involved include Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and others that may go by different or new names, but which are proxies of Tehran. 
Iran has long sought to bring its conflict with Israel to the Jewish state’s borders. Its backing of Hezbollah and Hamas was key to that strategy over the decades. For instance, Tehran supplies Hamas with financial support and also helped it develop longer-range rockets and a larger arsenal. Whereas Hamas rockets could once only travel a few kilometers, now they can reach most parts of Israel. 
The Islamic Republic also supported Islamic Jihad, which is even more of an Iranian proxy than Hamas. The group not only has an arsenal thought to include thousands of rockets, but it has gunmen in the West Bank and its leadership often resides in Damascus.

 It then goes on to show an animated sequence showing missiles raining down on Taiwan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (Reuters) -A number of masked people attacked a police vehicle with petrol bombs and other objects at a parade opposing the Good Friday peace accord in Londonderry, police said on Monday, a day before U.S. President Joe Biden visits Belfast.
A Reuters photograph showed four young people in the mainly Irish nationalist area of Creggan throwing petrol bombs at an armoured police vehicle, which was covered in flames on one side.
The crowd dispersed shortly afterwards and police said nobody was injured.
Monday marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement that largely ended three decades of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland. There is still some sporadic violence by small groups opposed to peace.
Britain's MI5 intelligence agency late last month increased the threat level in Northern Ireland from domestic terrorism to severe - meaning an attack is highly likely.
It has been mostly at the second highest category since its introduction in 2010 and was raised after an off-duty police officer was left seriously injured following a gun attack by the new IRA, one of the small dissident militant groups.
Biden is due to arrive in Belfast on Tuesday and make an address at a Belfast university on Wednesday, before travelling to Ireland for a further three days.

NYPost: US troops in Taiwan 'on the table' if China invades, Michael McCaul says

W
ASHINGTON — House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul has said the US may send troops to Taiwan should China invade the self-governed island. 
“If communist China invaded Taiwan, it would certainly be on the table and something that would be discussed by Congress and with the American people,” the Texas Republican told Fox News. 
“Are they prepared to do this? Is Taiwan worth it? I can argue for a lot of reasons why it is.” 
The potential move would represent a stark contrast to the th
e war in Ukraine, where the US has sent billions in weaponry to Kyiv but has refused to send troops. 

“[To deploy troops,] you’re talking about an authorized use of military force that would come out of my committee or a declaration of war, which we haven’t utilized since World War II,” McCaul said during a three-day trip to Taipei at the head of a congressional delegation.

Update: Conflict with China 'last resort' but Congress will authorize troops if Americans support it: McCaul (FOX News).

 
WNU Editor: I do not see the American public supporting a policy to go to war against China to defend Taiwan. But I could be wrong.

 
Update #2: House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul is correct about this .... McCaul says China could influence, take over Taiwan in next election ‘without a shot fired’ (The Hill). Taiwan President Tsai’s party suffered losses in recent local elections (link here), and my gut tells me that many Taiwanese do not want to suffer the same fate as Ukraine. That diplomacy and accommodation with China are the preferred options. 

 
Update #3: The Chinese are sending a message to Washington .... China military ‘ready to fight’ after drills near Taiwan (AP).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis issued a renewed call for peace to mark the end of the Easter period on Monday.

Following the Regina Caeli (Queen of Heaven) chant on St Peter's Square in Rome, Francis prayed for "the gift of peace for the whole world."
Several thousand pilgrims gathered to celebrate the second Easter holiday with the 86-year-old head of the Roman Catholic Church.
The Regina Caeli replaces the Angelus normally said on a Sunday up to Pentecost Sunday, which falls this year on May 28.
Francis has made use of all the church's occasions this Easter to issue a call for peace at the climax of the Christian calendar.
Around 100,000 faithful were on hand on Easter Sunday to hear the traditional Urbi et Orbi address, when Francis urged peace in Ukraine, praying for both Ukrainians and Russians.]]></summary>

The U.S. State Department says it's "monitoring closely" a Chinese maritime operation in the Taiwan Strait this week that includes boarding and inspecting ships. 
Why it matters: Officials in Taipei believe the unprecedented action in the Taiwan Strait is in reprisal for their president's D.C. meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 
* Taiwan's Maritime and Port Bureau said it had told ship crews not to comply with Chinese maritime "boardings and inspections" requests and instead contact the island's coast guard for protection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Northern Ireland on Monday marks the 25th anniversary of its landmark 1998 peace accords, with the UK province mired in political dysfunction and security concerns which threaten to overshadow the historic milestone.
No large-scale public events are planned for the day itself, but British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden will arrive Tuesday to launch several days of high-profile commemorations.
The territory has been significantly reshaped since pro-UK unionist and pro-Irish nationalist leaders struck an unlikely peace deal on April 10, 1998 -- Easter Good Friday -- following marathon negotiations.
Brokered by Washington and ratified by governments in London and Dublin, the Good Friday Agreement largely ended three decades of devastating sectarian conflict in Northern …]]></summary>

Charles, 74, immediately became king when Queen Elizabeth II died last September after her record-breaking 70-year reign but will be formally crowned at a May 6 service inside London's Westminster Abbey.
The three-day weekend will also feature a star-studded concert, nationwide "big lunch" and volunteering initiatives, as well as the traditional royal processions associated with the coronation.
Unveiling a host of ceremonial details, Buckingham Palace said the new emoji created to mark the historic occasion is based on the 17th-century St Edward's Crown.

In October, Lee Jong-chul's 24-year-old son was among more than 150 people killed in the disaster in the city's popular Itaewon district. Grief-stricken, he spoke to media, pleading with South Korean politicians to take action.
Then, as has happened after incidents from the Sandy Hook mass shooting to the disappearance of British woman Nicola Bulley, an internet mob formed: Lee and his family's personal tragedy was mocked, belittled and misrepresented online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new report from Politico suggests that Republicans are increasingly embracing what was once a fringe idea floated by former President Donald Trump: That America should bomb Mexico in the name of battling drug cartels.
Although it was once considered unthinkable to conduct a military invasion of the United States' neighbor to the south, Politico documents how launching attacks against the country is becoming mainstream within the GOP.
"Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and Mike Waltz (R-FL) introduced a bill seeking authorization for the use of military force to 'put us at war with the cartels,'" the report states. "Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said he is open to sending U.S. troops into Mexico to target drug lords even without that nation’s permission. And lawmakers in both chambers have filed legislation to label some cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move supported by GOP presidential aspirants."
Although some traditionally hawkish Republicans, including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) have expressed skepticism that bombing Mexico would be an effective strategy for stopping the flow of fentanyl into the United States, the idea is nonetheless gaining traction.

Even so, some foreign policy experts warn Politico that a war in Mexico has the potential to be a complete foreign policy disaster for the United States.
"If you thought Iraq was a bad situation, wait until you invade a country on our border,” a House Republican congressional aide told the publication. “Our grandchildren will be dealing with this.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fox News said on Sunday it has reached a settlement with a Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil, ending a defamation case in which Khalil said he was falsely accused on air of helping to rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election against Donald Trump.
Khalil had filed a defamation suit against the news outlet and former host Lou Dobbs, arguing in filings that they had fabricated claims he and other Venezuelans were involved in "orchestrating a non-existent scheme to rig or fix the election" against the former Republican president.
A short letter sent to U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan on Saturday said the parties had reached a "confidential agreement to resolve this matter" and expected to file a joint stipulation of dismissal next week.
"This matter has been resolved amicably by both sides. We have no further comment," Fox News said in a statement on Sunday.
Lawyers for Fox News and Dobbs referred Reuters to the statement. Khalil's lawyer did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Trump has continued to repeat debunked claims of widespread voting fraud as reason for his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election even after they have been roundly rejected by courts, state governments and members of his own former administration.
Jury selection is set to begin on Thursday ahead of a separate trial in Dominion Voting Systems Corp's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company Fox Corp over their coverage of debunked election-rigging claims.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
