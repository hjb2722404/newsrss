        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OilPrice.com: Price Cap On Russian Oil Comes Into Effect 
The price cap of $60 per barrel for Russian oil devised by the G7 and supported by the European Union comes into effect today, aiming to curb Russia’s revenues from oil exports while keeping flows into the international market flowing. 
The cap was agreed upon just before the deadline by the European Union after holdouts including Poland and Estonia refused to agree to the originally proposed range of between $65 and $70 per barrel that came from Washington.  In addition to the price cap, the EU has imposed an embargo on maritime imports of Russian crude, effective today.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: I said it before, and I will say it again. This price cap makes no sense. The G-7 are implementing policies that will kill investment in fossil fuels, which means energy shortages in the future and sky-high prices. The $60 oil cap is set so that no Russia oil will be sold to the West for the forseeable future. What this means is countries like China will get a steady supply of oil, at a discount, that will place it in a far more favorable economic and competitive position against the industries of the West and others who have signed onto this price cap. 
Update: Some are not paying attention to the West's price cap on Russian oil .... Tankers seen heading to Russia as oil price cap goes into effect on exports (CNBC). More here .... India signals it will continue to buy oil from Russia (AP).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Putin dons £2,600 Lora Piana coat he wore at pro-war rally as he drives over partially-destroyed Crimea bridge on same day 'Ukrainian drones' blast two Russian nuclear bombers 
* The key bridge to Crimea peninsular was blitzed in a surprise October 8 attack 
* It showed Kyiv is capable of hitting targets previously thought out of reach 
* Another surprise attack happened overnight, with two Russian nuclear bombers reportedly being damaged in a suspected Ukrainian drone strike on an airbase 
Vladimir Putin donned his £2,600 Lora Piana coat as he drove a Mercedes over the partially destroyed Crimea bridge and inspected repair works that are underway. 
The Kerch Bridge - which links Russia to annexed Crimea - was blitzed in a surprise attack in October, believed to have been carried out by Ukraine as a way of cutting Russian supply lines to the peninsular. 
Footage of the Russian president's excursion was released on the same day that an airbase for nuclear bombers was hit in Saratov region damaging two Tu-95 planes, while another air base in Ryazan was also hit in a suspected drone attack.

The United States director of national intelligence said Dec. 3 that Russian forces have severely depleted their munitions stockpiles, particularly precision-guided weapons, and doesn't have the capacity to replace them fast enough.

CNBC: U.S. intel chief says Russia is using up ammunition in Ukraine faster than it can replace it 
Russian forces in Ukraine are burning through ammunition faster than the country’s defense industry can replace it, U.S. National Intelligence Director Avril Haines said Saturday. 
Russia is using up ammunition “quite quickly,” prompting Moscow to look to other countries for help, including North Korea, Haines told NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell at a panel at the Reagan Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California. 
Asked how fast Russia was using up ammunition, Haines said: “I don’t think I can give you precise numbers in this forum. But quite quickly. I mean, it’s really pretty extraordinary.”

Russia has fired a barrage of missiles at targets across Ukraine for the eighth time in eight weeks. 
Residents of Odesa in the south were left without water and the whole of the Sumy region suffered a blackout.

WNU Editor: In the past two weeks all of my relatives who are still in Ukraine have lost power. I have one cousin who has a 2000 watt solar generator and she keeps her cell phone always charged. She lives in the center of Ukraine west of the Dnieper river. She did not answer her phone this morning. She is one of those who always answers her phone. Especially in this war. My gut (and fear) tells me that besides the electrical grid the communications grid is now probably being targeted.

However, the defense ministry said, “The campaign has been disproportionately costly” and “Bakhmut’s capture has become a symbolic, political objective for Russia.”

Reuters: U.S. Expects Reduced Tempo in Ukraine Fighting to Continue for Months 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence expects the reduced tempo in fighting in Ukraine to continue in the next several months and sees no evidence of a reduced Ukrainian will to resist, despite attacks on its power grid and other critical winter infrastructure, the Director of National Intelligence said on Saturday. 
"We're seeing a kind of a reduced tempo already of the conflict ... and we expect that's likely to be what we see in the coming months," Avril Haines told the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in California.
She said both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries would be looking to try to refit and resupply to prepare for a counter-offensive after the winter, but there was a question as to what that would look like, and added:

France 24: Orban says Hungary will stick to veto of EU's Ukraine aid plan 
Hungary's prime minister said Friday that he will continue to oppose a European Union plan to provide an €18 billion aid package to Ukraine in 2023, a position that promises sustained tensions as the bloc and the nationalist Hungarian government wrangle over democratic standards. 
In an interview on state radio, Prime Minister Viktor Orban acknowledged that Ukraine needs help to pay for the functioning of essential services but emphasized that he would block the EU's plan of joint borrowing to fund the package.

Von der Leyen lays out concerns with US Inflation Reduction Act  The EU must “simplify and adapt” its rules on state aid in response to the US’s new $369 billion (€351 billion) climate package, which has soured transatlantic ties and sparked fears of a trade war between Brussels and Washington, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday. 
Europe should “adjust our own rules to make it easier for public investments”, Ms von der Leyen said, in her first set of proposals responding to a chorus of demands from EU states to mitigate and counter the US green energy subsidy scheme. 
“The new assertive industrial policy of our competitors requires a structural answer,” she said in a speech focused on the trade row, which EU leaders have warned risked “fracturing” transatlantic unity.

Al Mayadeen: US troops in Lithuania shift from deterrence to combat mode 
Lithuania's Chief of Defense Lt. Gen. Valdemaras Rupsys said on Friday that American troops stationed in Lithuania have shifted from deterrence to combat mode in light of the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. 
 "Earlier, the key factor was deterrence... Then, there were forces that were mainly responsible for training us, getting familiar with the place, conducting tactical tasks. 
And now, when the situation has changed, those troops and equipment are deployed so that they could be used in a fight immediately," Rupsys told Lithuanian National Radio and Television. 
The Lieutenant claimed that the growing presence of US military forces across the European continent is an outcome of the current situation and "enemy threats" and does not imply that US forces are switching to active defense.

Over 58,000 people jailed since state of emergency declared in March over gang violence 
The government of El Salvador sent 10,000 soldiers and police to seal off a town on the outskirts of the nation's capital Saturday to search for gang members. 
The operation was one of the largest mobilizations yet in President Nayib Bukele's nine-month-old crackdown on street gangs that have long extorted money from businesses and ruled many neighbourhoods of the capital, San Salvador.

CNN: China’s plans for giant new London embassy unexpectedly rejected by local officials on security grounds  
China’s plans for a giant new embassy opposite the Tower of London have been unanimously rejected by local councilors on the grounds they pose a security risk to local residents, in a surprise decision that comes amid growing concerns over Beijing’s diplomatic activity in the United Kingdom. 
The London Borough of Tower Hamlets had indicated it was preparing to wave through the proposals drafted by the embassy’s architect, David Chipperfield, as recently as Wednesday, telling CNN then that the proposed initiative was “generally in accordance” with the area’s development plan and that “on this basis officers have recommended that planning permission and listed building consent are granted.”

CNN: China’s Xi acknowledges Covid frustration caused protests and hints at relaxing rules, EU official says 
Chinese President Xi Jinping has acknowledged the frustration within China amid his government’s unrelenting zero-Covid strategy, a European Union official told NN, in his first known remarks on the protests that have erupted across the country in recent days. 
Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel in Beijing on Thursday that the protesters were “mainly students” who were frustrated after three years of Covid, and hinted at the potential relaxation of China’s prevention measures, an EU official told CNN Friday. 
“Xi also said Omicron is less deadly than Delta, which makes the Chinese government feel more open to further relaxing Covid restrictions,” the EU official said.

The FIFA World Cup has highlighted Qatar’s laws and attitudes towards homosexuality.
 Qatar’s anti-LGBTQ policies have become a flashpoint in a controversial World Cup tournament; between national teams facing punishment for wearing rainbow “One Love” armbands, international fans told they can’t wear rainbow shirts, and a Qatari minister’s anti-LGBTQ comments this week, queer rights in the tiny Gulf emirate are one of the controversies on and off the pitch.

Reuters: Japan, Britain and Italy to announce joint fighter project as early as next week - sources 
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan, Britain and Italy will announce a groundbreaking agreement as early as next week to jointly develop a new advanced jet fighter, two sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters. 
For Tokyo and London it represents the culmination of ever closer defence ties, which in turn give Britain a bigger security role in Asia and provide Japan with new security partners that can help it counter neighbouring China's growing military power. 
The push to merge the British led Tempest jet fighter project with Japan's F-X fighter programme was first reported by Reuters in July. It will be the first time that Japan has collaborated with countries beyond the United States on a major defence equipment project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: Moldova PM: 'Greatest threats relate to energy security' 
Moldova relies heavily on Russia and Ukraine for energy and has been badly hit by the invasion of its neighbor.
In this interview, Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita explains the challenges faced by her country.  Natalia Gavrilita: First of all, the attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. These attacks have already caused two nationwide power cuts, one on November 15, 2022, and one a week ago. Today, we heard about new potential attacks, including ones targeting the nearby region of Odesa.
I think that the greatest threats we face relate to energy security — among other things — because of the supply line via Ukraine as we don't have any high-voltage transmission lines that can be connected to the Romanian grid. We are working on this and hope to have a joint high-voltage transmission line in 2024. Until then, we remain very vulnerable.

It would take a minimum of one week for Russia to pull out of Kherson city, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Russia still had 40,000 troops in the region and intelligence showed its forces remained in a…]]></summary>

The pullout proposed by General Sergei Surovikin, appointed last month to take overall charge of Russia's war effort, means Moscow is giving up a strategic city just north of annexed Crimea, the only Ukrainian provincial capital it had captured since its Feb. 24 invasion.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.

"Russian state media is following the midterm elections in the United States with great interest, but the mood in Moscow’s studios had noticeably soured in comparison to the fun-filled episodes of the years preceding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine," Davis reported. "While the experts and the hosts are still rooting for the Republicans, they stop short of promising the audience total salvation even with the GOP back in charge.
