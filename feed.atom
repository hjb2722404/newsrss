A Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2026 would result in thousands of casualties among Chinese, United States, Taiwanese and Japanese forces, and it would be unlikely to result in a victory for Beijing, according to a prominent independent Washington think tank, which conducted war game simulations of a possible conflict that is preoccupying military and political leaders in Asia and Washington. 
A war over Taiwan could leave a victorious US military in as crippled a state as the Chinese forces it defeated.  At the end of the conflict, at least two US aircraft carriers would lie at the bottom of the Pacific and China’s modern navy, which is the largest in the world, would be in “shambles.”

In a flurry of announcements, some of Ukraine's major Western allies pledged this week to send advanced armored combat vehicles to help Kyiv in its fight against Russia's invasion. 
Both the United States and Germany said they would provide new powerful weapons to Kyiv: 50 M2 Bradley fighting vehicles from Washington and 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles from Berlin.

Taipei, Taiwan CNN  — China sent 28 warplanes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait on Sunday as Beijing conducted its first large-scale military exercises around the island this year, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said. 
The 28 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) planes were among 57 spotted near Taiwan, the ministry said, adding they included J-10, J-11, J-16 and Su-30 fighters, H-6 bombers, three drones and an early warning and reconnaissance aircraft. 
Taiwan tasked aircraft, naval vessels and land-based missile systems to respond to the Chinese activities, the ministry said. 
A map provided by the ministry showed PLA aircraft crossing the median line in seven places from north to south and flying through Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) south of the island, then turning slightly north to the east of the line.

Another church in Canada has been set ablaze and destroyed. 
On New Year’s Eve, St. Joseph Lutheran Church in Hay Lakes, Alb. was completely burned down. 
The church was originally built in 1915.  First responders arrived on the scene at 11:30 pm and found the church “completely engulfed in flames.” Wetaskiwin RCMP say the fire was intentionally set. 
“Despite efforts of the first responders, the church was completely burned,” an RCMP release stated. 
Hay Lakes Fire Chief Bryce Wolfe told the Canadian Press that nobody was hurt in the incident, but questioned why anybody would burn down a church.

WNU editor: If this was a mosque or Sikh temple this would be front page news in Canada. 
 I have lost count on how many churches in Canada have been attacked and destroyed in the past two years. The last record is 2021 when 68 churches were vandalized or destroyed (link here).]]></summary>

Reuters: Japan's Kishida set to talk military buildup, chips on G7 tour 
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida starts a tour of key Western partners on Monday, after unveiling his country's biggest military buildup since World War Two as Tokyo weighs steps to counter China's growing power. 
Kishida, who will host a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) industrial powers in May, will meet leaders of the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Canada this week. 
Talks are expected to range from economic security and semiconductors to the war in Ukraine and rising tensions with nuclear-armed China and North Korea. 
"As leader of the G7 chair this year, I'll be making this visit to reaffirm our thinking on a number of issues," Kishida told a Sunday news programme. 
 "With the United States, we'll discuss deepening our bilateral alliance and how to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific."

PARIS (Reuters) -A surge in the cost of most food commodities last year, as the disruption caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of shortages, sent the U.N. food agency's average price index to the highest level on record. 
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 143.7 points in 2022, up 14.3% from 2021, and the highest since records started in 1990, the agency said on Friday. 
The index had already gained 28% in 2021 from the previous year as the world economy recovered from the impact of the pandemic.

The Telegraph: Olaf Scholz under pressure to release Leopard II tanks to Ukraine after Poland and Finland pledge

Germany manufactures Leopard II tanks and also holds the export licence for them, meaning Berlin must approve any shipment of the tanks to Ukraine or elsewhere. 
After both the Finnish and Polish governments signalled their desire to send Leopard II vehicles to Ukraine, Lars Klingbeil, a German MP and part of the ruling coalition, said the government wouldn’t be bounced into a deal and that no countries “were yet delivering heavy battle tanks” to Ukraine.

* About 200 migrants waited at the border fence after crossing on to U.S. soil 
* They cheered as Biden's motorcade raced past on Sunday afternoon  
* It was an ironic twist to such a carefully stage-managed visit to El Paso 
* The president probably never knew he came within a few dozen feet of them  
President Joe Biden came closer than he ever realized to hundreds of illegal migrants who had just set foot on American soil during his border trip on Sunday. 
As his presidential motorcade sped along closed roads from one carefully stage-managed facility visit to another, he came within a few dozen feet of migrants lining up on the wrong side of the border fence. 
They sent up a cheer as Biden's convoy race past above them even though he would almost certainly have been oblivious to their presence.

Thousands of people loyal to the right-wing Bolsonaro broke through police barricades and entered the Congress and Supreme Court buildings, Bolsonaro’s supporters — called Bolsonaristas — also surrounded the presidential palace, calling for Lula’s resignation, though the president was on an official state trip to Araquara and not in the capital, Brasília.

Politico: Serbian request to deploy troops in Kosovo denied by NATO 
Belgrade sought NATO’s authorization for deployment after a string of violent confrontations. 
NATO has declined Belgrade’s request to deploy 1,000 Serbian security and military personnel to Kosovo amid growing tensions between the two countries, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said. 
In an interview with Serbian television on Sunday, Vučić said that in a letter turning down the request, NATO’s mission in Kosovo — KFOR — declared “they believe that there is no need for the return of the Serbian Army to the territory of the Republic of Kosovo.” 
In December, Belgrade requested NATO’s authorization to deploy troops in neighboring Kosovo following a string of violent confrontations between Kosovo authorities and Serbs residing in the country’s northern region.

Condoleezza Rice and Robert M. Gates, Washington Post: Time is not on Ukraine's side 
When it comes to the war in Ukraine, about the only thing that’s certain right now is that the fighting and destruction will continue. 
Vladimir Putin remains fully committed to bringing all of Ukraine back under Russian control or — failing that — destroying it as a viable country. He believes it is his historical destiny — his messianic mission — to reestablish the Russian Empire and, as Zbigniew Brzezinski observed years ago, there can be no Russian Empire without Ukraine. 
Both of us have dealt with Putin on a number of occasions, and we are convinced he believes time is on his side: that he can wear down the Ukrainians and that U.S. and European unity and support for Ukraine will eventually erode and fracture. To be sure, the Russian economy and people will suffer as the war continues, but Russians have endured far worse.

WNU Editor: Some bitter truths from former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. 
Russia will not "return the annexed parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions to Ukraine voluntarily". And "Ukraine's economy has been completely destroyed, and the country's military forces have become directly dependent on Western supplies of equipment and weapons."]]></summary>

The clip, filmed during an official event, shows South Sudanese leader Salva Kiir standing for the national anthem, initially oblivious as a stain spreads on his trousers and a pool forms at his feet.

* President Joe Biden is due to visit the Texas border city of El Paso on Sunday 
* He has been under intense pressure to see the crisis for himself 
* But border patrol agents say he won't see the problems they have to deal with 
* The city cleared migrant camps last week and illegal crossings have dropped  
* Border agents' union says Biden will learn little from his three-hour visit 
When President Joe Biden makes his first visit to the border with Mexico on Sunday, he will hear from aid workers helping manage the immigration crisis and from local officials desperate for more support. 
What he won't see are the miserable makeshift camps dotted around El Paso that triggered headlines last month about migrants taking over the streets. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday law enforcement teams moved through the downtown area, picking up migrants who had entered the country illegally.

NYPost: Joe Biden reportedly ‘all in’ and readying launch of 2024 campaign 
President Biden is reportedly “all in” on a second run for the White House in 2024 — with an official announcement to come within weeks. 
“I think it’s all about timing at this point,” one Biden ally told The Hill Saturday. “It seems like he’s all in. It’s not really ‘if’ he runs anymore.” 
The 80-year-old Biden, the oldest president in the nation’s history, would be 82 if he is inaugurated a second time – and 86 by the end of his potential second term. 
He and his senior aides are preparing an announcement for release in February around the time of the State of the Union address to Congress, multiple sources told the outlet.

Reuters: U.S. trade deficit shrinks sharply as imports tumble 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit contracted by the most in nearly 14 years in November as slowing domestic demand amid higher borrowing costs depressed imports. 
The trade deficit decreased 21.0% to $61.5 billion, the lowest level since September 2020, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. 
The percentage decline in the trade gap was the largest since February 2009.  Imports tumbled 6.4% to $313.4 billion, with goods dropping 7.5% to $254.9 billion. Consumer goods imports were the lowest since December 2020.

* Members of Congress profited from selling defense company stocks, many after voting in favor of sending billions in weapons to Ukraine. 
* While unforeseen demand has left top weapons makers scrambling to meet production targets, defense stocks are performing well overall, according to Investopedia. 
* Several Republican lawmakers bought defense stocks but voted against Ukraine aid. 
Members of Congress raked in profits from defense contractor stocks after voting to send billions in military aid to Ukraine, according to financial disclosures and voting records reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation. 
The U.S. has delivered more than $20 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, a month before Russia invaded, and Nov. 20, according to data compiled by the Council on Foreign Relations, and Congress has approved billions more in spending on Ukraine. 
To make up for that aid, top defense companies have boosted production, and lawmakers trading on company stocks saw a financial windfall as a result, according to publicly available stock trading data.

The Guardian: US senators urge Joe Biden not to sell ‘scarce’ nuclear submarines to Australia 
Democrat and Republican lawmakers reportedly warned president that Aukus security pact could stress US submarine industrial base ‘to breaking point’ 
Two top US senators have urged president Joe Biden not to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, warning it would diminish US national security given the vessels are “scarce”. 
The intervention confirms the US is under pressure not to sell its submarines before Australia is able to build its own as part of the Aukus alliance – meaning it could be decades before Australia gains nuclear submarines. 
A spokesperson for the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, played down the leak, saying “the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines is taking shape, and an announcement remains on track to be made in the first part of this year.”

(Bloomberg) -- The World Bank is concerned that “further adverse shocks” could push the global economy into recession in 2023, with small states especially vulnerable. 
The warning is contained in an abstract for the bi-annual “Global Economic Prospects” report due for release on Tuesday and visible on the group’s Open Knowledge Repository website. 
Even without another crisis, global growth this year “is expected to decelerate sharply, reflecting synchronous policy tightening aimed at containing very high inflation, worsening financial conditions, and continued disruptions from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” the World Bank said.
“Urgent global and national efforts” are needed to mitigate the risk of such a downturn as well as debt distress in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), where investment growth is expected to remain below the average of the past two decades, the Washington-based lender said.

Authorities warned that both elderly and young Covid patients could have serious pneumonia if they should fail to seek medical treatments in an early stage.

SHANGHAI — China on Saturday marked the first day of "chun yun," the 40-day period of Lunar New Year travel known pre-pandemic as the world's largest annual migration of people, bracing for a huge increase in travelers and the spread of COVID-19 infections. 
This Lunar New Year public holiday, which officially begins January 21, will be the first since 2020 without domestic travel restrictions.  Over the last month China has seen the dramatic dismantling of its "zero-COVID" regime following historic protests against a policy that included frequent testing, restricted movement, mass lockdowns and heavy damage to the world's No.2 economy.

Kim Jong Un’s military plans are raising tensions with the South to new heights.
 Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at the highest in years after an unprecedented year of missile launches on the part of North Korea — and a more bellicose posturing from the South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol.
In 2022, North Korea launched at least 95 missiles — more than in any previous year — and shot off another short-range missile New Year’s Day of this year, according to the New York Times.

New York Times: Military Investigation Reveals How the U.S. Botched a Drone Strike in Kabul 
WASHINGTON — In the chaotic final days of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, U.S. military analysts observed a white Toyota Corolla stop at what they believed was an Islamic State compound. 
The Americans were already on edge. Three days earlier, a suicide bomber had killed scores of Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at a main gate of the Kabul airport. Now, officials had intelligence that there would be another attack there, and that it would involve a white Corolla. 
They tracked the car around Kabul for the next several hours. After it pulled into a gated courtyard near the airport, they authorized a drone strike. Hours later, U.S. officials announced they had successfully thwarted an attack.

Update #1: Errant Kabul drone strike was 'deadly blunder,' US military misled public about children killed: report (FOX News)  
Update #2: Pentagon misled public on drone strike that killed children – NYT (RT)   
WNU Editor: Bottom line. A lot of wrong assumptions and biases were the reasons for this disastrous drone strike. 
If I was to hazard a guess. The suicide bomber attack that killed 13 US soldiers at Kabul Airport a few days prior to this drone strike put everyone on edge, resulting in the mistakes and blunders that were then made.]]></summary>

Today, they are rewriting the textbooks on military art," Reznikov said.

Iconic product failures put on display at the CES consumer electronics show included a skin-toning face mask reminiscent of a horror film; eyewear embedded with therapeutic magnets and a model of failed 80s sports car DeLorean.
"Many founders have this bias where they think they're geniuses and everything that they are doing is super right," the gallery of failures organizer, Prelaunch founder Narek Vardanyan told AFP.
"(But) you can burn a lot of money and lose a lot of years."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[reported that a passenger on an Air India flight was detained after drunkenly urinating on an empty seat and another passenger's blanket.


	"Officers from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), an Indian federal police force, detained the man when the flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Fortune reported," the story continued. "The man and the other passenger discussed the incident came to an 'understanding,' an airline representative said. He gave the passenger a written apology, and she did not want the airline to file a police report. The man was then allowed to leave the airport."

similar incident happened last month, when a business class passenger urinated on an elderly woman. According to The Hindu, "The airline not only failed to hand him over to security personnel but also forced the woman to sit in the urine-soaked seat for a part of her journey."

This comes after a number of U.S. airlines went through years of elevated incidents on flights, spurred in part by passengers enraged over mask rules during the COVID-19 pandemic — something which the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately cracked down on with stiff fines, penalties, and criminal referrals in the most severe cases.
In one highly-publicized incident, an intoxicated American Airlines passenger on a flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City screamed racist threats at an Asian woman who had gotten up to stretch her back, then snarled and gnawed on his mask like an animal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kenyan police are investigating the killing of an LGBTQ rights activist whose body was discovered stuffed in a metal trunk in a killing that has sparked national outrage.
Edwin Chiloba, a 25-year-old fashion designer and model, was found dead by the roadside Wednesday some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the Rift Valley town of Eldoret, media reports said.
Police spokesperson Resila Onyango told Kenya's The Star newspaper that the motive of the killing was still unknown.
"Experts are handling the matter," Onyango said.
Rights activists have called for speedy investigations into attacks on LGBTQ people who face a precarious existence in the predominantly conservative Christian nation.
Homosexuality is taboo in Kenya and across much of Africa, and gays often face discrimination or persecution.
Attempts to overturn British colonial-era laws banning homosexuality in Kenya have proven unsuccessful, and gay sex remains a punishable crime with penalties that include imprisonment of up to 14 years.
"It is truly worrisome that we continue to witness escalation in violence targeting LGBTQ+ Kenyans," the Kenya Human Rights Commission said in a statement on Friday.
"Everyday, the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons are being violated with little consequence for perpetrators," it added, urging the police "to conduct swift investigations and ensure the killers are apprehended and prosecuted".
The Kenya LGBTQ Feminist Forum in western Kenya where Chiloba lived, said he had used "fashion to deconstruct gender and advocate for the rights of the marginalized group".
"We want to know as a community as Kenyans, what happened to Edwin, why he was murdered and who dropped his body at the scene," the group's programs director Becky Mududa said.
The death of Chiloba comes after another LGBTQ activist was found murdered in April last year.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican security forces captured on Thursday drug cartel leader Ovidio Guzman, a son of jailed kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, ahead of a visit by U.S. President Joe Biden next week.
Coming three years after a failed operation to detain Ovidio ended in humiliation for the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the arrest triggered a wave of violence that forced authorities to shutter airports and schools in the city of Culiacan.
Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told a news conference that security forces had captured the 32-year-old senior member of the Sinaloa Cartel. Ovidio, a fugitive since the previous arrest attempt, was now being held in the capital Mexico City, Sandoval said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - "That's an attack plane, Dad," said one of David Tellez's young children as they spotted Mexican military aircraft touching down alongside their Aeromexico passenger plane early on Thursday.
Then the gunfire began.
"As we were accelerating for take-off, we heard gunshots very close to the plane, and that's when we all threw ourselves to the floor," Tellez said after the incident in the northern city of Culiacan.
Violence broke out on Thursday throughout Culiacan after the arrest of Ovidio Guzman, the son of the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo, and a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel.
Aeromexico said nobody on Tellez's flight had been hurt. The Culiacan airport closed shortly after, as security forces patrolled the city, which was strewn with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Thursday, part of what the U.S. military calls routine activity but which riles China.
In recent years, U.S. warships, and on occasion those from allied nations such as Britain and Canada, have sailed through the strait, drawing the ire of China, which claims Taiwan against the objections of its democratically elected government.
In a statement, the U.S. military said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Chung-Hoon carried out the transit.
"Chung-Hoon’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific," the statement added.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry said the ship sailed in a northerly direction through the strait, that its forces had monitored its passage and observed nothing out of the ordinary.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The narrow Taiwan Strait has been a frequent source of military tension since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People's Republic of China.
The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
China has never ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing's sovereignty claims are void as the People's Republic of China has never governed the island.
A Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.
The close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intense gunfire rocked a cartel heartland in northwestern Mexico on Thursday after security forces launched an operation in which a son of jailed drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was reportedly arrested.
Vehicles were set on fire and shooting shook several areas of Culiacan -- the state capital of the Guzmans' bastion, Sinaloa -- including the city's airport, an AFP reporter said.
A security source who did not want to be named told AFP that the violence had broken out after an operation to capture Ovidio Guzman, but did not confirm reports by Milenio TV and other media that he had been captured.
The drug lord's son has allegedly helped to run the notorious Sinaloa Cartel since his father was extradited to the United States in 2017.
His capture would be a high-profile win in the war on drugs as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to welcome US President Joe Biden next week for a North America leaders' summit.
The Sinaloa state government urged people to stay at home on Thursday as the unrest sparked panic among residents seeking shelter.
Lopez Obrador told reporters that his government would announce the result of the operation later in the day.
"El Chapo" is serving a life prison sentence in the United States for trafficking hundreds of tons of drugs into the US over the course of 25 years.
However, his cartel remains one of the most powerful in Mexico.
Ovidio Guzman was captured briefly once before in 2019, but security forces freed him after his cartel waged an all-out war in response in the streets of Culiacan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, The Globe and Mail reported that the Greater Vancouver Zoo is being sued after a toddler was attacked by bears into whose enclosure she had reached.
"The notice of civil claim filed in British Columbia Supreme Court by the girl’s guardian, Richard Hanson, says the August, 2019, incident left her with a fractured wrist, and one of her fingers was partially amputated," said the report. "The lawsuit filed last month alleges the zoo and K-Bros Developments Corporation, which owns the property in Langley, B.C., owed a duty of care to the child, who was two years old at the time, given their control of the premises and the bears."
"It says the girl had reached through an 'unguarded chain link fence' at the zoo’s black bear exhibit and a 'group' of the animals 'attacked and mauled' her arm," said the report. "BC Emergency Health Services issued a statement shortly after the incident, saying a patient had been airlifted from the zoo in serious condition. Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court."
The lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being "vicious", but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.
"The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide 'any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions' on the premises," said the report. "It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl."
Zoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of "petting or feeding" the animals.]]></summary>

But France’s nuclear sector has been going through a tricky time, as a significant proportion of its reactors have had to close for maintenance. Analysts blame a mixture of bad luck and the consequences of a political deal from a decade ago.
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Europe’s energy crisis and climate change racks the world, you could expect France to be congratulating itself on its vast fleet of nuclear power stations. After all, nuclear energy produces barely any CO2 and does not leave countries relying on Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

The expanded humanitarian program would build on a policy launched in October that allowed thousands of Venezuelans to enter by air if they applied from abroad and could demonstrate they had a U.S. sponsor, two U.S. and one Mexican official said on Wednesday.
The details on the planned program come as U.S. President Joe Biden plans to give a border security-themed speech on Thursday and intends to visit the U.S.-Mexico border next week, addressing an issue that has challenged the Dem…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LIMA (Reuters) -Police used tear gas to disperse protesters trying to approach Peru's Congress headquarters on Wednesday, as thousands took to the streets two weeks after a wave of deadly protests over the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo.
By early evening, there were no reports of clashes with police, who closed off access to Congress, though transport authorities reported 35 blockade points across the country.
Almost two dozen died in protests across the country last month.
On Wednesday, protesters marched in Lima and Arequipa, many carrying the country's red-and-white flag, and demanded the resignation of current President Dina Boluarte, closure of Congress, changes to the constitution and Castillo's release.
Meanwhile, authorities said trains to the Inca citadel of Machu Picc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong residents have swamped clinics to get vaccinated against COVID-19 ahead of the expected reopening of the city's border with mainland China, which some people fear will bring a surge of infections to the financial hub.
City government centres providing shots produced by BioNTech have in recent days been mostly booked solid, some until February, in contrast with a few weeks ago when anyone seeking a vaccine could stroll into a nearly empty facility.
"After the opening of the border, I expect there will be more infected people on the streets, I want to reduce my chance of getting infected,” said a Hong Kong resident surnamed Wan, 33, who got his fourth shot this week.
Hong Kong’s government announced plans to reopen its border and resume restriction-free travel…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a fortnight-long break, Peruvians took to the streets again on Wednesday, blocking roads countrywide to demand the resignation of President Dina Boluarte, who took over from her ousted predecessor in December.
Protesters used stones and burning tires to barricade main routes in the southern regions of Puno, Cusco, Apurimac and Arequipa, as well as Junin in the center, chanting for Boluarte to leave.
She took over on December 7 as the South American country's first woman president following the impeachment and arrest of Pedro Castillo after he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
Castillo, a leftist former rural school teacher and union leader, faced vehement opposition from Congress during his 18 months in office, and had been the subject of numerous criminal investigations…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unknown vandals desecrated a Protestant cemetery in Jerusalem, damaging more than 30 gravestones, according to Israeli media reports.

Israeli radio reported considerable damage to the Zion cemetery on Wednesday, with gravestones damaged and crosses broken.
The Jerusalem Post, citing Jerusalem University College, reported that the perpetrators were two Jewish teenagers, saying the damage amounted to the equivalent of $99,700.
An Israeli police spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that an investigation was under way, but did not comment on the identity of the suspects.
A video shared on social media showed two figures throwing large stones at graves and overturning a cross.
The incident reportedly occurred on Sunday.
The cemetery, founded in 1848, also serves as a burial place for Jerusalem's German-speaking Protestant community. The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, spoke on Twitter of "contemptible criminal behaviour" by the perpetrators. "I hope the police will investigate, find these guys and bring them to justice."
The desecrated graves included those of three Palestinian police officers and members of various Protestant congregations, according to media reports, including bishop Samuel Gobat, Jerusalem's second Protestant bishop. He had bought the land for the cemetery.
The cemetery has been desecrated before and there have been previous incidents of hostility towards Christians in Jerusalem.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.  There’s clothing, food, fitness, healthcare, and interest at every level, with spaces filling up fast.
