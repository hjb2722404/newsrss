        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, freed from a US jail last year, on Friday urged US ex-president Donald Trump to seek refuge in Russia as his life was "in peril".
Bout, also known as the "Merchant of Death", was swapped for US basketball star Britney Griner in a high-profile prisoner exchange between Moscow and Washington in December.
"I believe your life is in peril," Bout wrote in a telegram sent to Trump and shown to the press in Moscow.
"The Biden administration will not stop just by dragging you through the court/prison industrial complex," he said, referring to Trump's successor Joe Biden.
"They would sooner end your life than let you stand in their way."
Bout told Trump, whom he has long admired, that he would find a "safe haven and from here you can lead the fight for the American people."
Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in a US prison when he was swapped for Griner. He has since joined a Russian nationalist party.
Accused of arming rebels in some of the world's bloodiest conflicts, Bout was arrested in Thailand in a US sting operation in 2008, extradited to the United States and sentenced in 2012.
Washington and Moscow have in recent years held several prisoner exchanges.
There are still several Americans held in Russia.
Last week, Russia arrested US journalist Evan Gershkovich and charged him with espionage, provoking an international outcry.
Washington has called the charges against him "ridiculous."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin had an awkward moment when he finished a speech and was met by silence and no applause, Newsweek reported. 
The moment, shared online by his critics, occurred on Wednesday at the Grand Kremlin Palace during a ceremony to present diplomatic credentials to 17 newly-appointed foreign ambassadors.
"In his speech, Putin singled out the new United States and European Union ambassadors, and said they were responsible for a breakdown in relations with Russia following his decision to invade Ukraine last February," Newsweek's report stated. "Addressing new U.S. ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, Putin indicated that U.S. support for a Ukraine revolution in 2014 'ultimately led to today's Ukrainian crisis.'" 
At the end of the speech, Putin's eyes scanned the room, seemingly waiting for applause which never came.

"No one applauded Putin after he finished his speech at the ceremony of ambassadors presenting their credentials in the Kremlin," Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, wrote in a tweet that included the video. "Putin waited for applause as he finished talking but none came."
"This is a delicious moment. Putin clearly expected a polite applause, but he received none. The ambassadors—some having been scolded—expected at least a hand shake, and they got none," Swedish economist Anders Åslund wrote on Twitter. "Just shows that no need to maintain any embassies or ambassadors in Moscow. Go home!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moscow has formally charged US journalist Evan Gershkovich with espionage, Russian news agencies reported Friday, adding that he had denied the accusations.
The arrest of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich prompted an outcry from media outlets and rights groups, as well as government officials in Washington.
"FSB investigators charged Gershkovich with espionage in the interests of his country," Russian state-run agency TASS said, citing a law enforcement source.
"He categorically denied all accusations and stated that he was engaged in journalistic activities in Russia," TASS said.
Gershkovich's arrest is seen as a serious escalation of Moscow's crackdown on the media.
His publication, one of the most prestigious in the United States, "vehemently denies the allegations" against its "trusted and dedicated reporter".
The case has been classified as secret, limiting the amount of information available.
His arrest also comes as Moscow's relationship with Washington has been severely downgraded because of the Ukraine offensive.
Washington has long accused Moscow of arbitrarily arresting Americans in order to secure the release of detained Russians.
US President Joe Biden called for Gershkovich's release on Friday, the White House calling the accusations against him "ridiculous".
Russia said on Thursday it was "pointless" to try to pressure Moscow over the case.

The billionaire, a larger-than-life figure who has dominated Italian public life for decades, was admitted Wednesday to the intensive care cardiac unit at Milan's San Raffaele Hospital.
On Friday, the Berlusconi-owned newspaper, Il Giornale, ran a front-page photo of a younger, beaming "Cavaliere" from a past election campaign, with the headline, "I won't give in."

A batch of rabbits seized this week by veteran customs officer Pol Meuleneire was crafted from a solid lump of MDMA, the raw material for pills of the rave drug ecstasy.

Thomas Bangalter, formerly one-half of electronic music duo Daft Punk, said this week that his fear of artificial intelligence was a factor in why the group split in 2021.
Bangalter reflected on the duo's fictional persona in a recent interview with BBC News, saying that he always felt the group's thesis was about making sure there is an absolute line "between humanity and technology."
"It was an exploration, I would say, starting with the machines and going away from them," he said. "I love technology as a tool [but] I'm somehow terrified of the nature of the relationship between the machines and ours…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-07T08:34:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - U.S. agents arrested a retired Salvadoran military officer this week on charges of participating in a brutal massacre of civilians during El Salvador's grinding civil war in the 1980s, according to a statement on Thursday.
Agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Roberto Garay on Tuesday in the state of New Jersey, the agency said.
Garay served as section commander of a special military unit known as the Atlacatl Battalion from 1981 to 1985.
Retired Salvadoran general Juan Rafael Bustillo acknowledged in 2020 that Atlacatl was responsible for the notorious 1981 El Mozote massacre, in which more than 1,000 villagers, mostly women and children, were slaughtered.
The battalion carried out extrajudicial executions at El Mozote, as well as in three other massacres in which "hundreds of noncombatant civilians" were killed, ICE said.
Garay then "willfully" misrepresented his involvement in the massacre from an immigration application he had submitted, according to the statement.
Reuters was not immediately able to locate Garay's lawyer.
One of several bloody Central American conflicts linked to the Cold War, El Salvador's 1980-1992 civil war pitted the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels against the army of the U.S.-backed right-wing government.
The war left some 75,000 dead and another 8,000 missing.
Touting the agency's investigation team that aims to hold accused war criminals accountable, ICE stressed that individuals like Garay must be investigated, prosecuted and expelled from the United States.
"Individuals who have committed atrocities overseas will not find safe haven in the United States," Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security John K. Tien said in the statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protesters started a fire at one of French President Emmanuel Macron's favorite restaurants in Paris on Thursday during clashes with riot police at the upmarket left-bank brasserie.
Staff at La Rotonde in the Montparnasse area of the city were forced to put out flames on the awning of the restaurant where Macron held a victory party during his successful 2017 election bid.
An AFP journalist saw a group of men dressed in black fire fireworks and throw stones in the direction of the eatery.
The fire was caused by a flare thrown on to the fabric awning, with firefighters needed to extinguish it.
Ranks of riot police formed to protect the business on the 11th day of national protests and strikes against Macron's widely unpopular bid to increase the retirement age to 64 from 62.
The red velour sofas and soft lighting of La Rotonde, a Belle Epoque hang-out once frequented by Picasso, have long been a favorite of Macron and his wife Brigitte.
The former investment banker held strategy meetings there as he prepared his bid for the presidency in 2017 and has been known to eat there with his wife since winning power.
In a decision criticized as elitist by his opponents at the time, Macron used La Rotonde to host staff and political allies for a party after he topped the first round of voting in 2017.
The restaurant has been targeted before because of its association with the 45-year-old president.
In 2020, during violent anti-government protests by so-called "Yellow Vests", a suspected arson attack left its entrance damaged.
"When there are marches and so on, you hear people saying 'Death to the Rotonde, Death to Macron'," Gerard Tafanel, who owns the bistro with his brother Serge, told AFP at the time.
"It happens all the time: anonymous phone calls, people who enter in the middle of the day saying 'Death to Macron'."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sydney (AFP)  Forget the Hollywood thriller "Snakes on a Plane", an Australian man is in trouble for taking a platypus on a train.
Police launched a public appeal after the 26-year-old man, accompanied by a woman, was spotted on a suburban train with a wild platypus swaddled in a towel.
The man, who faces court Saturday over alleged animal protection offenses, is accused of removing the elusive critter from a waterway in northern Queensland and taking it on a train trip to a shopping centre.
"It will be further alleged the pair were observed showing the animal to members of the public at the shopping centre," Queensland police said in a statement.
Railway officers nabbed the man, and they have spoken to the woman who was with him, police said.
But the platypus' fate is a mystery.
"Police were advised the animal was released into the Caboolture River and has not yet been located by authorities," police said.
"Its condition is unknown."
CCTV photos from Tuesday showed a man in flip-flops strolling along a train platform north of Brisbane while cradling the platypus -- about the size of a kitten -- under his arm.
The man and his female companion then wrapped it in a towel, "patting it and showing it to fellow commuters", police said.
Under Queensland's conservation laws, it is illegal to take "one or more" platypus from the wild, with a maximum fine of Aus$430,000 (US$288,000).
"Taking a platypus from the wild is not only illegal, but it can be dangerous for both the displaced animal and the person involved if the platypus is male as they have venomous spurs," police said.
"If you are lucky enough to see a platypus in the wild, keep your distance."
With stubby tails like a beaver and the bill of a duck, platypuses were famously seen as a hoax by British scientists encountering their first specimen in the late 18th century.
Platypuses are native to Australia's freshwater rivers and are part of a rare group of mammals -- the monotremes -- that lay eggs.

The French president, who arrived on Wednesday for a three-day state visit, has made clear he is seeking to dissuade China from supporting Russia's invasion of its neighbor.
"I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses and everyone to the negotiating table," the French head of state told Xi during a bilateral meeting in Beijing.
And in a joint statement following those talks, the two leaders reaffirmed their call for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow "as soon as possible".
The two sides also reaffirmed their opposition to the use of nuclear weapons during the conflict.

Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen held talks with McCarthy in Los Angeles on Wednesday, expressing gratitude afterwards for the meeting that included other US lawmakers.
"Their presence and unwavering support reassure the people of Taiwan that we are not isolated and we are not alone," Tsai told reporters.
China had repeatedly warned both sides the meeting should not take place, and deployed an aircraft carrier through waters southeast of Taiwan hours before the talks.
Three additional warships were detected in waters separating the island from mainland China, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said on Thursday morning.

        <updated>2023-04-06T08:59:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) - There is no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl between China and Mexico, China's foreign ministry said on Thursday, responding to a letter from the Mexican president asking Beijing to help limit illicit flows of the deadly drug.
China has not been notified by Mexico about any seizure of fentanyl from China, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing.
"U.S. needs to face up to its own problems and take more substantive measures to strengthen regulation within its borders and reduce demand," Mao said, referring to drug abuse as a problem "made in the U.S.".
Mexico's president said on Tuesday he had written to Chinese president Xi Jinping, urging him to help control shipments of fentanyl as he fended off criticism in the U.S. that Mexico is not doing enough to stop trafficking of the synthetic opioid.
Fentanyl, widely used in hospitals during anaesthesia and for pain relief, has become a major black market narcotic in the United States. Mexican drug cartels have increasingly taken part in the illegal business.
Overdoses of the opioid killed more than 100,000 people in the 2022 U.S. fiscal year, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended in the March 22 letter efforts to curb supply of the drug, while rounding on U.S. critics, some of whom want Washington to intervene militarily in Mexico.
The letter and China's response did not mention supplies of the precursor chemicals used to make the powerful sedative.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says both finished fentanyl and precursors are transported from China to Mexico, the United State and Canada, often by international mail.

After years of hostility that fuelled conflicts across the Middle East, Tehran and Riyadh agreed to end their diplomatic rift and re-open embassies in a major deal facilitated by China last month.
Beijing's secret role in the breakthrough between Tehran and Riyadh shook up dynamics in the Middle East, where the United States was for decades the main mediator, flexing its security and diplomatic muscles.

Nikkei Asia: China weighs export ban for rare-earth magnet tech

 
Beijing looks to strike back after Washington's chip restrictions 
BEIJING -- China is considering prohibiting exports of certain rare-earth magnet technology in a move that would counter the U.S.'s advantage in the high-tech arena. Officials are planning amendments to a technology export restriction list, which was last updated in 2020. 
The revisions would either ban or restrict exports of technology to process and refine rare-earth elements. There are also proposed provisions that would prohibit or limit exports of alloy tech for making high-performance magnets derived from rare earths.

In all, there are 43 amendments or additions in the draft list first announced in December by the commerce and technology ministries. 
Officials have finished taking public comments from experts, and the changes are expected to go into force this year.

High performance magnets are used in a wide range of applications, such as motors for electric vehicles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marketwatch: Here’s what is really behind OPEC+ oil-production cuts, say energy analysts 
An unexpected production cut announced on Sunday by OPEC+ oil producers complicates strained relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with investors seeing signs of geopolitical posturing in the decision. 
However, some market analysts contend the cuts were less about sending a message to Washington and more about stabilizing oil prices amid fears of recession, as well as protecting the supply and demand balances. 
Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday announced they would slash a further combined 1.16 million barrels per day of oil production from May until the end of 2023. Russia, stinging from price caps and embargoes on its energy products as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, said it would extend its 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut through year-end. Together OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, make up the group known as OPEC+.

 
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The US was caught completely off-guard by this OPEC+ decision to cut oil production. This is a surprise because China, India, and a few other big oil consumers were given a heads-up that this was going to happen. 
I see this as another indication on how strained U.S. - Saudi ties have become, and how furious the Saudis are with the Biden administration's determination to bring down the price of oil via through price caps and selling America's strategic oil reserve on the open markets. 
Bottom line. 
Expect $100/barrel in the coming months, and a return to higher gas prices by this summer .... Gas prices will surge in coming weeks after OPEC cuts production, analysts say (FOX News).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sarcophagus of Ramses II left Egypt for the first time in 1976 for France, where the mummy was treated against fungal decay.
Now the ancient Egyptian ruler is back in France to go on display in Paris as part of the travelling exhibition "Ramses and the Gold of the Pharaohs."
The exhibition, which has already stopped in San Francisco and Houston in the US, is the only site where the sarcophagus will join the tour.
France greatly appreciates this trust by Egypt, said French Minister Rima Abdul Malak on Monday at the unveiling of the sarcophagus.
The fact that it is back in Paris after more than 40 years is also proof of the excellent relationship between the two countries, she added.
The wooden coffin was taken out of a high-security transport crate at the Grande Halle de la Villette, where it will be the highlight of the exhibition from April 7 onwards.
Until September 6, over 180 objects from the reign of Ramses will be presented, including royal masks, statues and jewellery. Ramses II is considered one of the most important pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.
He was born around 1303 BC and died in 1213 BC. Ruling for 66 years, he was one of the longest reigning heads of state in the world. He had numerous palaces and temples built, such as the temple complex of Abu Simbel.
In 1976, the sarcophagus was received like a head of state - with a red carpet and much pomp. While the wooden coffin was on display in the Grand Palais in Paris, scientists treated the mummy with radiation against its increasing decay caused by bacteria and moisture.]]></summary>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday traveled to Poland, marking his first formal visit to Warsaw since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February. 
“A meeting of neighbors, a meeting of allies, a meeting of partners, a meeting of friends,” Zelensky said in a Telegram post, accompanied by a photo of the Ukrainian president shaking hands with Polish President Andrzej Duda. “For the sake of our nations. For their future.”

WNU Editor: A lot of speculation floating around on this visit. My gut tells me that Zelensky traveled to Warsaw to engage in talks on the upcoming spring offensive, and Poland's growing role in the Russia - Ukraine war. Because of the sensitivity of these discussions, the decision was made to have face to face talks to avoid any possibility of Russia intercepting their communications. 
But in this backdrop of these discussions, there are growing problems in the Polish - Ukraine relationship .... Zelenskyy’s Warsaw visit overshadowed by political blowup (Politico).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ, former President Bill Clinton said that he feels personally responsible for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, due to his role in convincing Kyiv to surrender nuclear weapons in the aftermath of the Cold War, Newsweek reported. 
"I feel a personal stake because I got them [Ukraine] to agree to give up their nuclear weapons," Clinton said "None of them believe that Russia would have pulled this stunt if Ukraine still had their weapons," he said.
As Newsweek points out,  in 1994 Ukraine gave up the stockpile of nuclear weapons it had collected since the Cold War. "...some experts have disputed whether nuclear weapons remaining in Ukraine would have diverted the course of the current war," Newsweek's report stated. "Clara Guest, a research assistant in proliferation finance at King's College London, U.K. wrote in March 2022 that 'Ukraine would never have been able to maintain its nuclear weapons and facilities or manufacture and produce new components' given the lack of funds for the newly-independent country."
Clinton went on to say that he knew Russian President Vladimir Putin "did not support the agreement [then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin] made never to interfere with Ukraine's territorial boundaries—an agreement he made because he wanted Ukraine to give up their nuclear weapons." 
"When it became convenient to him, President Putin broke it and first took Crimea," Clinton said. "And I feel terrible about it because Ukraine is a very important country."]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
