SCMP: Chinese scientists war-game hypersonic strike on US carrier group in South China Sea 
* Military planners conclude the Gerald R. Ford and its fleet could be destroyed 'with certainty' in rare published report 
* The researchers said 24 hypersonic anti-ship missiles were used to sink the US Navy's newest carrier and its group in 20 simulated battles 
Hypersonic weapons could be "catastrophic" for the most potent aircraft carrier group in the US fleet, according to war game simulations run by a team of military planners in China. 
Over 20 intense battles, Chinese forces sank the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier fleet with a volley of 24 hypersonic anti-ship missiles, in a simulation run on a mainstream war game software platform used by China's military. 
In the scenario, the US vessels are attacked after continuing to approach a China-claimed island in the South China Sea despite repeated warnings. 
A paper detailing the war game was published in May by the Chinese-language Journal of Test and Measurement Technology. It is the first time the results of simulated hypersonic strikes against a US carrier group have been made public.

Ukrainian casualties during the battle for Artyomovsk were several times higher than Russian ones, Evgeny Prigozhin has claimed  
The head of Russia’s Wagner Group, Evgeny Prigozhin, has revealed that the private military company lost around 20,000 servicemen during the liberation of the strategic Donbass city of Artyomovsk, also known as Bakhmut, from Ukrainian forces.
In an interview published by Wagner’s press service on Tuesday, Prigozhin said that during the long-running battle he had boosted the company’s ranks with 50,000 inmates from Russian prisons, who were offered the chance to fight instead of completing their sentences. 
“Around 20% of them have died,” Prigozhin said. “The casualties among them were the same as among those who enlisted by contract with us.” 
This suggests that Wagner’s losses in Artyomovsk, which is a key settlement in Russia’s Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), amounted to some 10,000 former prisoners and 10,000 military professionals.

WNU Editor: What the Western media is ignoring is Prigozhin's disclosure that a minimum of 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the battle for Bakhmut.

SCMP: China said to be negotiating arms deals with Saudi Arabia and Egypt 
* The Middle Eastern countries seek to diversify weapons supply amid Ukraine war and tensions with Washington, according to intelligence service 
* Riyadh eyes air defence systems and drones as part of possible yuan-based deal while Cairo plans to buy J-10C fighter jets, report says 
China is reportedly in talks with Saudi Arabia and Egypt for major arms deals as the countries seek to diversify their weapons supplies to become less reliant on the United States and Russia. 
Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) is currently in talks with China North Industries Group Corporation (Norinco), a state-owned defence company, to buy weapons ranging from reconnaissance drones to air defence systems, according to Tactical Report, a Beirut-based intelligence service focused on the Middle East. 
Weapons involved in the potential deal include the Sky Saker FX80 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the CR500 vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV, the Cruise Dragon 5 and 10 - two types of loitering munitions, better known as suicide drones - and the HQ-17AE short-range air defence (SHORAD) system, the service reported last week.

Daily Beast: Ukrainian Spy Boss Bluntly Admits Plan to Assassinate Putin 
The second in command of Ukrainian military intelligence says Kyiv’s spies are actively trying to kill Vladimir Putin—and the Russian leader is well aware of it. 
Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy head of Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate, made the admission in an interview with German publication Welt. 
“Putin is noticing that we are getting closer and closer to him, but he is also afraid of being killed by his own people,” Skibitsky was quoted as saying, describing the assassination of Putin as a top priority. 
“Many people in Russia still support this ‘special operation’ [against Ukraine], but thanks to social media and phone checks, we know that so many Russians have died now that it scares people,” he said. 
He said similar plans were in the works for Wagner Group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose mercenaries have been accused of grisly war crimes against Ukrainian troops.

Valery Zaluzhny will no longer be able to command Kiev’s forces due to head trauma, a source claimed to the agency 
 
The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, General Valery Zaluzhny, was seriously wounded in a Russian missile strike near the city of Kherson earlier this month, a security source has told RIA Novosti. 
Zaluzhny, who has recently disappeared from the public eye, suffered a head injury and numerous shrapnel wounds during the attack in early May, which targeted a Ukrainian command post near the village of Posad-Pokrovskoe, the agency reported on Wednesday. The general underwent a craniotomy at a military hospital in Kiev after the strike, the source claimed. 
Doctors expect the 49-year-old to live, although he will not be able to conduct his duties as commander, the source added.

OSLO (Reuters) -The world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, sailed into Oslo on Wednesday, a first for such a U.S. ship, in a show of NATO force at a time of heightened tension between NATO and Russia over the war in Ukraine. 
The ship and its crew will be conducting training exercises with the Norwegian armed forces along the country's coast in the coming days, the Norwegian military said. 
"This visit is an important signal of the close bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Norway and a signal of the credibility of collective defence and deterrence," said Jonny Karlsen, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, the operational command centre of the military. 
At one spot on the Oslo fjord, dozens of people of all ages gathered on the shore to observe the vessel as it cruised by, taking pictures and videos.

 (Bloomberg) -- In 2021, a remote coal town in northeastern China was forced to undergo an unprecedented financial restructuring. Its struggles since are an ominous sign for President Xi Jinping as other heavily indebted municipalities look set to follow suit. 
Hegang, a city with nearly a million people near the Russian border, had debt of more than double its fiscal income when it hit the headlines almost 18 months ago. 
It was the first time a city administration had taken official emergency steps since the State Council unveiled rules in 2016 on how local governments, from counties to provinces, should deal with debt risks. 
Hegang’s residents are now feeling the brunt of the fiscal clampdown. During a recent visit to the city, locals complained about a lack of indoor heating in freezing winter temperatures, and taxi drivers said they were being slapped with more traffic fines. Public school teachers worried about rumored job cuts, and street cleaners endured two-month delays to their salaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: The White House has warned stocks will plunge 45% and a deep recession will strike in the 3rd quarter if the US defaults 
* The stock market could crash 45% if the US defaults on its debt, the White House warned. 
* The debt ceiling deadline is quickly approaching in early June as the US Treasury exhausts all of its extraordinary measures. 
* President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are scheduled to meet about the debt ceiling later today. 
A US debt default could spark a 45% crash in the stock market and generate a deep recession akin to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, the White House's Council of Economic Advisers warned earlier this month. 
The deadline for lawmakers to lift the debt limit is rapidly approaching in early June as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen exhausts all of the department's extraordinary measures. 
If a debt ceiling deal isn't reached, it could mean the Treasury forgoes Social Security payments, payments to Medicare and Medicaid, and ultimately payments to US bond holders.

A potential debt default in mid-June has led to a surge in the US 1-month Treasury yield to 5.56% from its low of 3.31% last month.

Disputes in Russian society do not pose a threat to Vladimir Putin's government, says Bruno Kahl, head of Germany's foreign intelligence service. 
He argues Moscow has enough recruits and equipment for the war.

Bruno Kahl, the head of the German Intelligence Agency (BND), said on Monday that he does not see any weakening of Russian President Vladimir Putin's rule. 
"We see no cracks in the Putin system," Kahl said at the Federal Academy for Security Policy (BAKS).

Update #2: Russia still capable of waging protracted war, no cracks visible in Putin’s system – German intel (Euromaidan Press) 
 WNU editor: The expectation in Russia right now is that this is going to be a long war. 
How long? 
A few days ago the head of The Wagner Group Yevgeny Prigozhin said it was going to take up to one to one and a half years before Ukraine forces are defeated in the Donbas. Other Russian pundits are saying that because the Kremlin is waging an attrition war against Ukraine (and the West), the war is going to take 3 to 4 years. 
As to what is my take. 
Last year I said the war was going to last into the final months of 2024.  I am now going to revise it to the spring of 2025.]]></summary>

When a part breaks, the Department of Defense turns to contractors to replace them. Some companies have monopolies on needed parts. The government will pay subcontractor TransDigm $119 million for parts that should cost $28 million – an extra $91 million. https://t.co/fYZi66kQcz pic.twitter.com/JkgY5HXRmL

In 1991, before defense contractors consolidated, shoulder-fired Stinger missiles cost $25,000. Now, the sole supplier charges more than $400,000 a piece, making it costly to replace each missile sent to Ukraine. https://t.co/Ij4C4sEd3k pic.twitter.com/KvKUDcDOai

CBS 60 Minutes: Weapons contractors hitting Department of Defense with inflated prices for planes, submarines, missiles 
With the U.S. supplying billions-of-dollars of munitions to Ukraine and growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait, some Pentagon generals are sounding alarms about the dwindling supply of U.S. weapons ... at a time when the cost of replacing them is skyrocketing – we wondered why the Pentagon is finding it hard to procure weapons it needs at a price taxpayers can afford? A six-month investigation by 60 Minutes found it has less to do with foreign entanglements than domestic ones - what can only be described as price gouging by U.S. defense contractors.

Armed insurgents who crossed the border from Ukraine to launch attacks in Russia's Belgorod region have been defeated, Moscow says. 
Villages in the border region were evacuated after coming under sustained shellfire. 
Russia says that 70 of the attackers have been killed and insists the fighters are Ukrainian.
But Kyiv has denied involvement and two Russian paramilitary groups have said they were behind the incursion. 
Monday's raid appears to have been the largest cross-border incursion since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine 15 months ago. 
It led Moscow to declare a counter-terrorism operation in Belgorod, giving the authorities there special powers to clamp down on communications and people's movements. The measures were lifted on Tuesday afternoon.

Concerns security deal could leave Papua New Guinea stuck between increasingly hostile US and China 
Papua New Guinea has signed a defence and maritime cooperation agreement with the US during the US Pacific Islands Forum in Port Moresby. 
The agreement was signed by defence minister Win Bakri Daki and US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who flew into the country early on Monday, in the place of US president Joe Biden. 
Before signing the agreements, prime minister James Marape defended himself against claims it could encroach on the country’s sovereignty after a leaked draft document suggesting it gives US personnel and contractors legal immunity; allows aircraft, vehicles and vessels operated by or on behalf of the US to move freely within its territory and territorial waters; and exempts US staff from all migration requirements.

The details have also  not been made public .... United States and Papua New Guinea strengthen defence ties with new security agreement, details still to be made public (ABC News Australia).

Biden’s decision to start training Ukrainian pilots on the jet is more about setting up Kyiv’s long-term capabilities, Kendall said. 
Sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine would make no “fundamental change” to the war, the U.S. Air Force secretary said. 

“It will give Ukrainians an increment of capability that they don't have right now, but it's not going to be a dramatic game-changer, as far as I'm concerned, for their total military capabilities,” Frank Kendall told reporters Monday during a Defense Writers Group event.
President Biden announced on Friday that the U.S. will help train Ukrainian pilots on F-16s and other modern jets, a move that could enable Kyiv to use the jets if any are donated.

After that, it will likely be ‘up to six months’ before Ukraine could fly its own jets, Troels Lund Poulsen says.

Ukrainian pilots could start training on F-16 fighter jets in July, Denmark’s acting Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen indicated Tuesday. 
“My expectation is that by the end of June, we’ll have it officially set up, so we can hopefully start after that,” Poulsen told reporters before a ministers’ meeting in Brussels.

“And then, it’s probably an effort that will take up to six months before we have the facilities in place so that we can fly F-16 fighter jets from Ukraine,” the minister added.

And then there are the rumors that these aircraft are going to be flying from bases in Poland, not Ukraine.]]></summary>

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -A week-long ceasefire in Sudan got off to a shaky start on Monday as witnesses in the capital Khartoum reported fighter jets flights over the city and continued fighting in some areas. 
Heavy bombardments could be heard in east Khartoum, witnesses said, and one resident shared a picture of thick black smoke rising into the sky. 
In Omdurman and Bahri, Khartoum's twin cities, people said they heard sounds of weapons firing. 
After five weeks of fierce battles between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the warring factions on Saturday agreed to a seven-day truce starting at 9:45 p.m. (19:45 GMT) on Monday that was intended to allow for the delivery of aid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In her column for the Wall Street Journal, longtime Washington D.C. insider and presidential speechwriter Peggy Noonan claimed the long-awaited report finally submitted by special counsel John. Durham cleared up some mysteries surrounding the relationship between Donald Trump and Russia,  but greater and more important questions still remain.

It is now poised to spread its influence beyond the sparsely populated region near Madrid, with the party set to make gains in regional and local elections on May 28.
Surveys suggest the main opposition conservative Popular Party (PP) could need the support of Vox to govern in half of the 12 regions casting ballots, just as it did in Castilla y Leon last year.
Polls also indicate the PP is on track to win a year-end general election but will need Vox to form a working majority and oust Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's coalition government from office.

Majid Kazemi, Saleh Mirhashemi and Saeed Yaghoubi were found guilty of "moharebeh" -- or waging "war against God" -- for shooting dead three members of the security forces at a demonstration in the central city of Isfahan on November 16, the judiciary's Mizan Online news website said.
Iran witnessed waves of nationwide protests following the September 16 death of 22-year-old Amini, an Iranian Kurd who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the Islamic republic's strict dress rules for women.

Rourke died "after a lengthy illness with pancreatic cancer", the Smiths lead guitarist and co-founder said.
"Andy will always be remembered as a kind and beautiful soul by everyone who knew him, and as a supremely gifted musician by people who love music," Marr wrote on Instagram.
Along with drummer Mike Joyce, Rourke provided a whip-tight rhythm section underlying Marr's pioneering chords and co-founder Morrissey's mordant lyrics as the Smiths became one of Britain's best-loved bands in the 1980s.

Mocha brought lashing rain and winds of 195 kilometers per hour (120 miles per hour) to Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh on Sunday, collapsing buildings and turning streets into rivers.
The storm churned up villages, uprooted trees and knocked out communications across much of Myanmar's Rakhine State.
The United Nations said Friday that at least 800,000 people in Myanmar need emergency food aid and other assistance in the wake of the cyclone.

HIROSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) -Group of Seven (G7) leaders laid wreaths in the Japanese city of Hiroshima on Friday, almost 78 years after it was attacked with a nuclear bomb, in a sombre start of a summit expected to put more sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Hiroshima's legacy as the first place ever to be attacked with a nuclear weapon has taken on a more urgency following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin's talk of his readiness to use nuclear arms.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will travel to Japan to join the leaders of the world's advanced democracies at their Hiroshima summit, a European Union source said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea accused the U.S. and South Korea of ramping up "nuclear blackmail" with joint military drills, pledging to take corresponding action against what it called "warmongers' madness," state media KCNA said on Friday.
U.S. and South Korean forces have been staging an intensified series of annual springtime exercises since March, including air and sea drills involving a U.S. aircraft carrier and heavy bombers.
North Korea has reacted angrily to the exercises, calling them a rehearsal for invasion.
"Their plot to crush us militarily is another clear indication that the enemy warmongers' madness has reached a point where it cannot be overlooked," KCNA said. "The frantic nuclear war fuss among U.S. and puppet warlike bellwethers is bound to trigger corresponding responses".
Pyongyang would continue to develop its weapons programmes, KCNA said, calling it a "legitimate right of a sovereign state to have more powerful means of self-defence" to fend off "serious situations and prospective threats".
North Korea has been stepping up military activity in recent months, unveiling designs for new, smaller nuclear warheads, firing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. and testing what it called a nuclear-capable underwater attack drone.
This week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a military satellite station, saying successfully launching a spy satellite is an "urgent requirement of the prevailing security environment".
Kim has said he prioritised a spy satellite programme as part of efforts to advance surveillance technology to improve the country's ability to strike targets in a crisis.
The reclusive country in December conducted what it called an important "final phase" test for a spy satellite and said it would complete preparations for the launch by April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roger Ailes before his death told his wife that Rupert Murdoch’s two sons sought his ouster and wanted to turn Fox News into a centrist or even liberal outlet, Elizabeth Ailes said Thursday during an appearance on Newsmax.
“Roger made running Fox News look easy, and as you know, it was anything but,” she told Newsmax host Eric Bolling.
“Rupert has the checkbook, he has money, but he couldn't hold a candle to Roger in terms of genius, and the ideas that Roger put forth back in '96,” she said, noting that it was her late husband who developed the the right-wing network’s “fair and balanced” and “we report, you decide” slogans.
“That was a challenge to the establishment mainstream media who thought that just because they said they were objective people we would take them at their word, and we all know that they were very liberal all that time.” 
The former Fox News CEO’s wife claims that Murdoch’s sons, Lachlan and James, played a role in Ailes’ ouster from the company.
Roger Ailes left Fox News in July 2016 amid a torrent of sexual harassment allegations by subordinates including Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. 
“My thought is that I go back to July 2016 when events unfolded, and after 20 years of running the channel and turning it into a $20 billion asset, throwing off $2 billion in profits, the sons Lachlan and James had decided that they wanted Roger gone,” she said.
“Roger said to me, these useless kids tweedle dumb and tweedle dumber are going to ruin the channel and turn it into CNN and that's exactly what's happening," she added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Thursday retracted his claim that four Indigenous children missing for more than two weeks after an airplane crash in the Amazon had been found alive.
Writing on Twitter, Petro said he had deleted his tweet from Wednesday night in which he had announced the rescue of the four children, including an 11-month-old baby.
"I am sorry for what happened. The military forces and Indigenous communities will continue in their tireless search to give the country the news it is waiting for," he said in his retraction.
More than 100 soldiers have been deployed with sniffer dogs to search for the minors who were traveling in an airplane that crashed on May 1, leaving three adults including the pilot and the children's mother dead.
Rescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old include a 13, nine and four-year-old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.
"At this time there is no other priority other than progressing with the search until finding them," added Petro. "The children's lives are the most important thing."
Petro's stunning announcement on Wednesday had been met with uncertainty as he gave no details about where or how the children had been rescued, nor how they had survived alone in the jungle.
Amid widespread confusion, the military has not confirmed any rescue.
Avianline Charters, owner of the crashed aircraft, had previously said that one of its pilots in the search area was told the children had been found and that they "were being transported by boat downriver and that they were all alive."
But the company also said that "there has been no official confirmation" that the children were out of danger, and thunderstorms posed a risk to them reaching safety.
Petro said on Thursday that the news of the supposed rescue had been provided by the government's Institute of Family Welfare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British musician Sting warned against songs written by artificial intelligence in an interview with the BBC published Thursday, urging caution about the technology.
The 71-year-old former frontman of The Police said, "The building blocks of music belong to us, to human beings."
"That's going to be a battle we all have to fight in the next couple of years: Defending our human capital against AI," he said.
The use of AI in music is the subject of debate in the industry, with some denouncing copyright abuses and others praising its prowess.
AI technology was used to imitate Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd in a song released last month called "Heart On My Sleeve".
The viral track was briefly available on music streaming platforms before it was pulled following a copyright complaint from Universal Music Group, which publishes both artists through a subsidiary.
David Guetta meanwhile recently used AI to add a vocal in the style of rapper Eminem to a song for a live show.
But the French producer said he will not release it commercially.
"The tools are useful, but we have to be driving them," Sting said.
"I don't think we can allow the machines to just take over. We have to be wary," he added.
Sting -- real name Gordon Sumner -- shot to fame with The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as "Roxanne", "Message in a Bottle" and "Walking on the Moon".
He then forged a solo career with classics such as "Englishman in New York", "Fields of Gold" and "Shape of My Heart".

Fahmy, who started off in an Old Cairo workshop about 50 years ago, said her focus has been designs that "resonate with Egyptian identity".
Artists and artisans in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, draw from a history that spans ancient Pharaonic times, the Mamluk, Ottoman and modern eras.
"We are lucky to be able to draw on 6,000 years of history," said textile designer Goya Gallagher, founder of Cairo-based Malaika Linens, which makes high-end household pieces.

"The main challenge is making sure our pieces are timeless, that they're very well made and always hand-made," she said at the company workshop on the west…]]></summary>

It was sold by Sotheby's following a four-minute bidding battle between two bidders, the auction house said in a statement.
The Bible was bought by former US diplomat Alfred Moses on behalf of an American nonprofit that will gift it to the ANU Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Israel, Sotheby's said.
"The Hebrew Bible is the most influential book in history and constitutes the bedrock of Western civilization. I rejoice in knowing that it belongs to the Jewish People," said Moses, an ambassador under president Bill Clinton.

The defense ministry said Russian forces had launched 30 cruise missiles from land, sea and air, targeting several regions and killing one person in Odesa.
The military said its air defense units had destroyed 29 of the cruise missiles and shot down four drones.
"A series of air attacks on Kyiv, unprecedented in their power, intensity and variety, is continuing," said Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv's civil and military administration.
The attack follows other recent barrages in which Ukraine claimed to have downed several advanced Russian Kinzhal missiles.

XIAN, China (Reuters) - Central Asian heads of state converged in China's historic city of Xian on Thursday for one-on-ones with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seal pledges of "enduring" friendship, and paving the way for a summit expected to result in a regional pact with Beijing.
The bilateral talks will set the stage for a group meeting on Friday, the first in-person gathering of the six leaders, where Xi will deliver an "important" speech and an "important" political document will be signed, China's foreign ministry has said.
Across the Silk Road city of Xian, banners, billboards and even taxi signs were set up to promote the summit, with some in both Chinese and Russian.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso has dissolved the country's parliament in the middle of impeachment proceedings against him.
Lasso's office said in a statement on Wednesday that the president would rule by decree until new parliamentary elections are held.
A date for new elections would be set within a week, according to the statement.
"It is impossible to solve the challenges with a parliament whose goal is to destabilize the country," Lasso said in a televised address. "I have to give an answer to the political crisis. Ecuador needs a new political and social pact."
Lasso is accused of knowing about unfavourable contracts between the state oil transport company Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana and the private shipping company Amazonas Tankers, but doing nothing to modify or terminate the deals after taking office.
The unfavorable contracts are said to have cost the Ecuadorian state several million dollars.
Lasso on Tuesday rejected allegations of embezzlement that have been levelled against him in parliament.

Speaking to reporters a day after the premiere of his new film "Jeanne du Barry" on the festival's opening night, he said he did not care about being boycotted by Hollywood.
"Do I feel boycotted now? No 'coz I don't think about Hollywood, I don't have much need for Hollywood," said the actor.
"It's a very strange, funny time where everyone must fall into line," he added. "If you want to live that kind of life, I wish you the best. I'll be on the other side."

The magazine’s publication would represent a step forward for a continent where some 33 countries still have laws on the books criminaliaing same-sex relations.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
