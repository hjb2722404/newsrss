KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Poland for its "historic" help in rallying Western support for Ukraine during a visit to Warsaw and said Ukrainian troops were still fighting for Bakhmut in the east but could withdraw if they risked being cut off.
Poland has provided vital weaponry to Kyiv since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year and taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees. During Zelenskiy's visit, Warsaw announced it would send 10 more MiG fighter jets to Kyiv on top of four provided earlier. 
Polish President Andrzej Duda said Warsaw was also working to secure additional security guarantees for Ukraine at a NATO summit to be held in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in July.

Update #2: Zelensky: Situation in Bakhmut remains 'complicated' (Kyiv Independent)

 
WNU Editor: There are reports that three quarters of Bakhmut is now under Russian control .... Russian forces claim to 'legally' control Bakhmut, but Ukraine says fighting is still raging (NBC News). There are also reports that all roads going into Bakhmut are under Russian fire-control. If true, it may be difficult if not impossible for Ukraine to pull out of the city if the order comes in..]]></summary>

Nikkei Asia: China weighs export ban for rare-earth magnet tech

 
Beijing looks to strike back after Washington's chip restrictions 
BEIJING -- China is considering prohibiting exports of certain rare-earth magnet technology in a move that would counter the U.S.'s advantage in the high-tech arena. Officials are planning amendments to a technology export restriction list, which was last updated in 2020. 
The revisions would either ban or restrict exports of technology to process and refine rare-earth elements. There are also proposed provisions that would prohibit or limit exports of alloy tech for making high-performance magnets derived from rare earths.

In all, there are 43 amendments or additions in the draft list first announced in December by the commerce and technology ministries. 
Officials have finished taking public comments from experts, and the changes are expected to go into force this year.

High performance magnets are used in a wide range of applications, such as motors for electric vehicles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marketwatch: Here’s what is really behind OPEC+ oil-production cuts, say energy analysts 
An unexpected production cut announced on Sunday by OPEC+ oil producers complicates strained relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with investors seeing signs of geopolitical posturing in the decision. 
However, some market analysts contend the cuts were less about sending a message to Washington and more about stabilizing oil prices amid fears of recession, as well as protecting the supply and demand balances. 
Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday announced they would slash a further combined 1.16 million barrels per day of oil production from May until the end of 2023. Russia, stinging from price caps and embargoes on its energy products as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, said it would extend its 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut through year-end. Together OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, make up the group known as OPEC+.

 
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The US was caught completely off-guard by this OPEC+ decision to cut oil production. This is a surprise because China, India, and a few other big oil consumers were given a heads-up that this was going to happen. 
I see this as another indication on how strained U.S. - Saudi ties have become, and how furious the Saudis are with the Biden administration's determination to bring down the price of oil via through price caps and selling America's strategic oil reserve on the open markets. 
Bottom line. 
Expect $100/barrel in the coming months, and a return to higher gas prices by this summer .... Gas prices will surge in coming weeks after OPEC cuts production, analysts say (FOX News).]]></summary>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday traveled to Poland, marking his first formal visit to Warsaw since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February. 
“A meeting of neighbors, a meeting of allies, a meeting of partners, a meeting of friends,” Zelensky said in a Telegram post, accompanied by a photo of the Ukrainian president shaking hands with Polish President Andrzej Duda. “For the sake of our nations. For their future.”

WNU Editor: A lot of speculation floating around on this visit. My gut tells me that Zelensky traveled to Warsaw to engage in talks on the upcoming spring offensive, and Poland's growing role in the Russia - Ukraine war. Because of the sensitivity of these discussions, the decision was made to have face to face talks to avoid any possibility of Russia intercepting their communications. 
But in this backdrop of these discussions, there are growing problems in the Polish - Ukraine relationship .... Zelenskyy’s Warsaw visit overshadowed by political blowup (Politico).

“When considering youth disqualified for one reason alone, the most prevalent disqualification rates are overweight (11 percent), drug and alcohol abuse (8 percent), and medical/physical health (7 percent),” the Pentagon’s 2020 Qualified Military Available Study of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 read.

“Then our give up on energy independence and even energy dominant –our raging crime statistics if you look in Democrat-run cities, numbers the likes of which we’ve never seen before, the open threats by various countries of the use of nuclear weapons.”]]></summary>

According to Front Line Defenders' annual global analysis, at least 401 human rights defenders (HRDs) in 26 countries were victims of targeted killings in 2022, up from 358 people murdered in 35 countries the previous year.

The report notes that five countries—Colombia, Ukraine, Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras—accounted for over 80% of HRD murders in 2022, with Colombia alone accounting for 46% of the total with at least 186 killings documented and verified. Indigenous and environmental defenders made up 48% of last year's victims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finland becomes the 31st member of NATO on Tuesday, in a historic strategic shift provoked by Moscow's war on Ukraine, which doubles the US-led alliance's border with Russia.
Last year, the Kremlin's all-out invasion of Ukraine upended Europe's security landscape and prompted Finland -- and its neighbor Sweden -- to drop decades of military non-alignment.
Awkward allies Turkey and Hungary, for different reasons of their own, delayed Finland's bid to come under the NATO umbrella -- and Stockholm's progress remains blocked.
But last week, the Turkish parliament voted to clear Finland's final hurdle.
Completing the ratification in well under a year still makes this the fastest membership process in the alliance's recent history.
All that remained were Tuesday's highly choreographed formalitie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pablo Picasso, who died 50 years ago this week, remains the star of art auctions, with several of his works commanding record sums.
Five works by the Spanish artist have been sold for more than $100 million (93 million euros), 16 for more than $50 million, and 39 for more than $30 million, according to AFP's count.
Most expensive: $179.4 million
"The Women of Algiers (Version O)", painted in 1955, is the most expensive work by Picasso ever sold at auction, going for $179.4 million on May 11, 2015, fivefold what the seller had paid 18 years earlier.
At the time it was the biggest art auction sale in history.
It was dethroned in November 2017 by the sale of "Salvator Mundi" attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, which went under the hammer for $450 million and holds the record to this day.
Previous record-holders
In the last 20 years, two other Picasso works have held the record for the biggest art auction sale: "Boy with a Pipe", from May 2004 to February 2010, and "Nude, Green Leaves and Bust" from May 2010 to May 2012, according to an AFP database.
$4.7 billion in a decade
With sales of Picasso works adding up to $4.7 billion over the past 10 years, according to Artprice's annual reports, no other artist can touch his totals.
Andy Warhol ($3.4 billion) and Claude Monet ($2.6 billion) lag well behind the King of Cubism.
3,000 pieces sold annually
Picasso was not only a painter, his oeuvre also includes sculptures, drawings, ceramics, engravings, lithographs, illustrated books and ballet costumes.
These have appeared in 31,745 auctions in 10 years -- an average of more than 3,000 objects up for sale every year.

The Republican McCarthy, the third most senior U.S. leader after the president and vice president, will host a meeting in California on Wednesday with Tsai, during a sensitive stopover in the U.S. that has prompted Chinese threats of retaliation.
China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, staged war games around the island last August after then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, visited the capital, Taipei.

They also say the boat may have been a decoy, put to sea to distract from the true perpetrators, who remain at large, according to officials with knowledge of an investigation led by Germany’s attorney general. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details about the active inquiry, including doubts about the Andromeda’s role that haven’t been previously reported.

Did the U.S. Air Force suffer a nuclear weapons accident at an airbase in Europe a few years back?  [Update: After USAFE and LANL initially declined to comment on the picture, a Pentagon spokesperson later clarified that the image is not of an actual nuclear weapons accident but of a training exercise, as cautioned in the second paragraph below. The spokesperson declined to comment on the main conclusion of this article, however, that the image appears to be from inside an aircraft shelter at Volkel Air Base.] 
A photo in a Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) student briefing from 2022 shows four people inspecting what appears to be a damaged B61 nuclear bomb.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is poised to meet with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday – a historic event that comes amid warnings from China. The California Republican’s office shared details of the meeting in a release Monday morning. 
The release states that McCarthy will host a bipartisan meeting with Tsai at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. 
The meeting has been long anticipated and is all-but-guaranteed to rattle the tense relationship between the US and China, which became even more fraught after a Chinese spy balloon floated over North America and was then shot down by US fighter jets in February.

That means giving them not only the knowledge they need, but also the soft skills and social and emotional competencies.”    This approach reflects Woo’s firm belief in the importance of nurturing well-rounded individuals with the personal qualities and self-confidence to make the right choices. And it will inform her decisions as she guides the school, which was founded in 2019, into a post-pandemic era which promises new opportunities for sports, drama, volunteering, group projects, team competitions and international exchanges.  “We aim to lay a very strong foundation, and that starts in the kindergarten and primary years,” says Woo, noting that Invictus offers a “through-train” system taking children all the way up to Year 13 in secondary. “We follow a spiral curriculum which progressively adds breadth and depth and is also in line with the school’s objective of providing a quality, affordable education which sets high standards and lets students explore their potential.”    There are two main campuses, with kindergarten and primary classes in Tseung Kwan O and secondary in Chai Wan, where pupils do IGCSEs and A-Levels, using the Cambridge programme.

Itamar Ben-Gvir says force will focus on Arab unrest as police chief voices concerns and opposition figures denounce it as ‘militia’ 
Israel’s government has authorised the establishment of a national guard proposed by the far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who said it would focus on Arab unrest, as political rivals accused him of setting up a sectarian “militia”. 
The previous government had begun moves to set up an auxiliary police force to tackle internal political violence after pro-Palestinian protests in mixed Jewish-Arab areas during the Israel-Gaza conflict in May 2021. However, that government ended before the force was finalised.

Thaci and three other top members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) rebel group all denied 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity as they appeared at a special tribunal in The Hague.

Montenegro's long-standing leader Milo Djukanovic has suffered a resounding presidential election defeat. 
The 36-year-old centrist former economy minister, Jakov Milatovic, declared victory on Sunday evening after the presidential run-off. 
He will take over from Mr Djukanovic, who has held power as president or prime minister in Montenegro for over three decades. 
Snap parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in the summer.

"Tonight is the night we have been awaiting for over 30 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of top-secret government documents is heating up, as Fox News' Bret Baier is reporting that special counsel Jack Smith has now subpoenaed members of Trump's Secret Service entourage.
"FOX News is told multiple U.S. Secret Service agents connected to Former President Donald Trump have been subpoenaed & are expected to testify before the D.C. grand jury likely on Friday," Baier reports. "The grand jury appearances are related to the Special Counsel Jack Smith probe into the handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago."
It is not known what the Secret Service members will be asked, although they may have been direct witnesses in seeing how Trump decided to respond to a government subpoena requesting he return all documents with classified markings in his possession to the government.
Investigators on Smith's team have reportedly amassed evidence that Trump deliberately tried to hang onto certain classified documents requested by the government after receiving a formal subpoena, as they believe that he ordered some boxes of documents to be removed from a secure storage area to other locations once he learned the government wanted them back.

In fact, prosecutors' evidence appears to be so strong that it convinced a judge last month to pierce attorney-client privilege after determining it was more likely than not that the former president had used conversations with attorney Evan Corcoran in the furtherance of a crime.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are vanishingly few great collaborations in the annals of fine art. For a brief moment in the 1980s, Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat showed the world how it was done.
It started with a bang. Warhol, 54, met Basquiat, 22, for lunch in October 1982 and took a polaroid of them together.
Basquiat took it to his studio and returned just two hours later with a portrait. Warhol was stunned by its brilliance.
Soon they were working together on portraits that combined their favored tropes: Basquiat's masks, skulls, graffiti and obscure symbols; Warhol's pop-art imagery, logos and newspaper headlines.
The brief, intense collaboration lasted from 1983 to 1985 and produced some 160 works.
An unprecedented number of them -- 70 -- have been brought together for a show at the Louis Vuitton Fou…]]></summary>

Malka Leifer was guilty on 18 charges, the jury said, including raping a student during a sleep-over and sexually assaulting another teenage pupil during a school camp.
She was cleared of a further nine charges.
Leifer was the principal of the Adass Israel School in Melbourne when she was first accused of sexual assault in 2008.
A dual Israeli-Australian citizen, Leifer fled to Israel before she could be arrested, sparking a drawn-out court battle spanning more than 70 extradition hearings.
The fugitive mother-of-eight was finally flown back to Australia in 2021 and was put on trial in February this year…]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
