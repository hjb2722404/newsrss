        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 56 people, including children, have died in an apartment building fire in Vietnam's capital Hanoi.

Rescue efforts have been hampered due to the building not having emergency exits and being positioned at the end of a narrow alley.

At least 70 people were rescued and nearly 40 people were injured when they jumped onto neighbouring roofs to escape the inferno.

Firefighters extinguished the fire in about an hour, as footage shows the intense blaze shooting out from every floor of the building.

Vietnam's Prime Minister visited the site to extend his condolences and police have detained the building's owner ahead of further investigation.]]></summary>

New legislation is set to be introduced by Defence Minister Richard Marles which will prevent sensitive defence information from being accessed by foreign militaries.

It follows revelations Beijing was seeking to poach former Australian pilots to train its military last year.

The Chinese recruitment scheme reportedly extended to using third parties for headhunting Western military leaders.

WARSAW, Poland — Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak on Monday approved a framework deal to buy 486 launcher-loader module kits for its M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. 
“In line with the adopted schedule, deliveries are expected to begin in 2025,” the Armament Agency, which is the ministry’s unit responsible for purchases of weapons and military gear, said in a statement. 
The acquisition of the Lockheed Martin-made launchers is part of the Polish army’s Homar-A program. The nation’s defense industry will also be involved in the effort by supplying products and components, according to the agency.

Warzone/The Drive: B-21 Raider Seen Like Never Before In New Images

 
We have just been given our first side view of Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Raider stealth bomber, an aircraft that remains cloaked in secrecy.  
During Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q. Brown's speech at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's mega conference outside of Washington, D.C., the soon-to-be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs dropped two new images of the B-21 Raider. While the stealth bomber was rolled out in December of last year, it remains cloaked in secrecy. Brown, the top Air Force uniformed officer, didn't specifically reference the images in his presentation. 
Up until today, only one angle of the full aircraft has been seen by the public — head-on — and in a very controlled environment at the bomber's unveiling. Aside from a close-up of the cockpit area at an angle, all imagery published since then has been from the same head-on perspective, although it has progressively shown the aircraft in more detail. Now we have our first quartering view of the flying-wing jet, which provides significant details about its design. A new head-on image also gives us a better idea of the bomber's actual size. Both images were taken at Northrop Grumman's facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California.

Russia says Ukraine has launched 10 missiles and three unmanned boats in an attack on the home of its Black Sea fleet in Crimea. 
The attack caused a large fire at a Sevastopol shipyard which left 24 people injured, Russia said. 
Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhayev claimed most of the weapons were intercepted but that two ships had been damaged.

Unmanned vessels, known by many different names including sea drones and drone boats, operate on or below the water. 
They usually have built-in explosives and cameras that feed directly back to the person controlling them.

At a moment the war in Ukraine grows more and more unpredictable, given neither Russia nor the West have shown any signs of backing down, the FT writes that "Nato is preparing its biggest live joint command exercise since the cold war next year, assembling more than 40,000 troops to practice how the alliance would attempt to repel Russian aggression against one of its members."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States "won't hesitate" to impose more sanctions on Russia and North Korea if they conclude any new arms deals, the US State Department warned on Wednesday after the two countries' leaders met for talks in Vladivostok. Earlier, Ukraine's military said its forces had struck naval targets and port infrastructure in Crimea's Sevastopol, in what appeared to be the biggest attack yet on the home of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Australian’s Washington correspondent Adam Creighton says US President Joe Biden’s impeachment inquiry will be “a lot more focused” on one single question from the Biden family dealings. 

Mr Creighton joined Sky News Australia host Paul Murray to talk about the “perfectly justified” impeachment inquiry into the President on corruption claims. 

“We have known about the suspicion of corruption in relation to Ukraine for some time,” he said.

“Then of course we had Hunter Biden’s laptop and all the emails about ’10 per cent for the big guy’, so there has been a lot of smoke there. 

“Biden lied – that’s the big one … he has been saying over and over he knew nothing about his son’s business dealings.

“For the Democrats, it is bad – he is going to have the pall of impeachment hanging over him as he campaigns for re-election.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an unspecified location in Russia’s Far East region later in the week.

Kim Jong Un arrived in Russia on board a heavily armoured train yesterday ahead of his meeting with the Russian president.

Vladimir Putin is currently attending the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok which is Russia’s closest city to the North Korean border.

North Korea Political Expert Dr Leonid Petrov believes the meeting between the meeting is significant for both parties and gives Russia the chance to demonstrate its new diplomatic ambition following its invasion of Ukraine.

“Russia has been increasingly isolated and … it’s important to demonstrate that he (Vladimir Putin) is not just someone who is now being sought by the International Criminal Court but also supported by the neighbouring states like North Korea.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: US releases $6bn in frozen Iran funds for prisoner swap 
The US has issued a sanctions waiver for banks to transfer $6bn (£4.8bn) of frozen Iranian funds from South Korea to Qatar, paving the way for the release of five Americans held by Iran.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress that the money would provide "limited benefit" to Iran as it could only be used for humanitarian trade. 
He also confirmed that five Iranians detained in the US would be freed as part of the prisoner exchange deal.

Republicans condemned the transfer.

One senator accused President Joe Biden of paying a "ransom to the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism".

Kyiv Independent: Poll: Most Ukrainians consider president directly responsible for corruption in government 
According to a recent poll published by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, 78% of surveyed Ukrainians believe that the president bears direct responsibility for corruption in the government and regional administrations. Only 18% of respondents disagreed with this statement. 
Older Ukrainians seem more demanding of the head of state than the young people, reads the report. The share of respondents who think the president is responsible for corruption ranges from 70% to 81% among people aged 18-29 and those over 60, respectively.

Update: Almost 80% of Ukrainians consider Zelenskyy responsible for corruption in government and military administrations (Ukrainska Pravda)

 
WNU Editor: I have been told by my Ukrainian contacts that recent poll numbers for President Zelensky are horrible. He is bleeding support that is being ignored by the West.
Corruption is one of the reasons, but the horrors of the war and the failure of the counteroffensive to achieve its promised goals has shifted the mood among my Ukrainian friends, family members, and contacts. They are blaming President Zelensky for this, and unless the tempo of the war changes significantly in favor of Kyiv, this erosion of support for President Zelensky will continue, as well as support for the war.]]></summary>

Politico:  Ukraine needs to do more to fight corruption, Germany’s Baerbock says 
Kyiv ‘still [has] a way to go in the implementation of the anti-oligarch law and the fight against corruption,’ German foreign minister says.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Monday called on Ukraine to step up its efforts to fight corruption during a surprise visit to Kyiv.

Ukraine “still [has] a way to go in the implementation of the anti-oligarch law and the fight against corruption,” Baerbock said on arrival in the Ukrainian capital, the German foreign ministry said in a statement. 
The German minister praised Kyiv’s “impressive” progress on judicial reforms and media legislation — completed even as Ukraine has spent the last 18 months fending off Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion, which has cost thousands of lives. Baerbock also reassured Kyiv that it would get Berlin’s “decisive support” for its European Union bid.

The Telegraph: Ukraine’s counter-offensive is stalling. The West must prepare for humiliation 
Time is running out for Ukraine. After 18 months of war, it is no longer a question of if the Western alliance will falter, but when. Since the start, despite making many of the right noises and supplying some military hardware, France and Germany, in particular, have been reluctant partners. Their leaders have often seemed more concerned with finding an “off-ramp” for Vladimir Putin than ejecting his forces from Ukraine. As well as dependency on Russian energy, a pacifist instinct among Western European political classes has led to neglect of their armed forces and a corresponding fear of escalation. 
As the provider of the lion’s share of backing for Ukraine, it is the US calling the shots in this war.

WNU Editor: The above author (Colonel Richard Kemp) is a fervent supported of Ukraine, and that is why his commentary is an eye-opener. 
Bottom line. 
The West has to escalate their involvement in the war even more by significantly ramping up military aid to Ukraine and increasing economic pressure on Russia. If not, Western public support for the war will continue to decrease, and the likelihood of a Ukraine victory is all but unlikely.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: For more info on the above video .... Mysterious 9/11 video that emerged on YouTube 20 years after atrocity (Mirror). 
WNU Editor: I was in my office 22 years ago when I noticed that the browser on my computer was very slow. I was trying to load CNN, and it would just not load. My guess was that CNN's servers had crashed, but I could not load any other news services like the BBC, CBC, France24, AP, etc.. That was when I knew something was wrong. 
I was finally able to load some news from the CBC, and it was then that I knew what was happening. While wondering how could a passenger plane pilot make such a catastrophic mistake, news of a second plane hitting the next tower was being reported. I knew right away that the U.S. was under a coordinated attack, and I made the decision to go home. 
While driving home I called my brother who was living in California to tell him that the U.S. mainland was under attack. After a minute my connection to him died. I learned later from my brother that when I called him I actually woke him up (it was 6:45am his time), and by telling him that New York and Washington were under attack his first thought was that a nuclear attack was underway. 
Getting home I had 3 VCRs, and I started to record the news from the CBC, ABC News, and NBC. I knew history was happening, and I wanted my own archive. I recorded the news from those channels for the next 36 hours, and when finished I took the tapes and put them aside to look at them later. 
Twenty-two years later, I took the tapes out last night, and watched some of it for the first time. 
Sighhhh .... 
It does not get old. It feels like yesterday.]]></summary>

"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…]]></summary>

Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U", died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.

Ukraine has not taken direct responsibility for the string of attacks, including on the capital Moscow, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that "war" is coming to Russia.
Polls show the former stand-up comedian's crowdfunding campaigns for the military have rendered him one of the country's most trusted public figures -- second only to Zelensky.
Offering a rare glimpse at Ukraine's homegrown explosive drones, Prytula recently shared images of himself with a fleet in an undisclosed location.

This year's anniversary comes as the release of the film Oppenheimer has offered a high-profile reminder of the history of the atomic bomb and as nuclear tensions in the current day have heightened, in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their doomsday clock to 90 seconds to midnight.
"Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory," Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui said during his peace address at the commemoration ceremony …]]></summary>

Typhoon Khanun, which killed at least two people in Japan, is due to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday, near where some 43,000 scouts have been camping in North Jeolla province for their problem-plagued jamboree.
Korean media have called the jamboree "a national disgrace" after an extreme heatwave caused hundreds of scouts to fall ill and prompted American and British scout groups to withdraw as criticism grew over conditions at the campsite.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
