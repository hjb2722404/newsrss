Eight people including a nephew of Morrisseau were arrested this week and face a total of 40 charges including forgery of artworks and of paperwork that purported to authenticate them.
"Over 1,000 allegedly fraudulent paintings have been seized. The total number produced and sold is unknown," Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Kari Dart told a news conference.
Some of the paintings sold for tens of thousands of dollars to unsuspecting buyers across Canada and internationally.
Detective Kevin Veilleux said the forgery ring began in 1996 with a single individual, David Voss, 51, allegedly …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: A shot over China's bows? Incredible moment Air Force breaks ship IN HALF with a single 2,000 pound 'quicksink' bomb dropped by F-15E Strike Eagle with 'torpedo-like' accuracy 
* The bomb, a JDAM, tested in the video  is called the Quicksink because of the rate at which it sinks ships 
* The JDAM is a relatively inexpensive way to convert unguided bombs into all-weather precision-guided munitions 
* An F-15E Strike Eagle fighter launched the modified bomb, successfully striking the target by detonating a GPS-navigated bomb underneath the vessel 
Recently released footage shows the decimation of a cargo ship by a 2,000 pound Joint Direct Attack Munition dropped by the Air Force from an F-15E Strike Eagle. 
In the roughly one-minute video taken last April, an old, derelict cargo ship - the Courageous - is seen floating in the Gulf of Mexico.
Moments later a JDAM approaches from above and the Courageous is literally lifted out of the water and split in half, as waves begin to crash on the decks.

Peter Frankopan, Spectator: Is Putin winning? The world order is changing in his favour 
‘This is not about Ukraine at all, but the world order,’ said Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, a month after the invasion. ‘The unipolar world is irretrievably receding into the past … A multi-polar world is being born.’ The US is no longer the world’s policeman, in other words – a message that resonates in countries that have long been suspicious of American power. The West’s core coalition may remain solid, but it has failed to win over many of the countries that refused to pick sides. Moscow’s diplomatic mission to build ties and hone a narrative over the past decade has paid dividends.

The article is the latest in a series of combative remarks by Russian politicians and commentators after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, suggesting Moscow would, if necessary, be prepared to deploy its vast nuclear arsenal.
RIA said the article, published in the Voennaya Mysl (Military Thought) magazine, concluded Washington was worried it might be losing dominance over the world and had therefore "apparently" prepared plans to strike Russia to neutralise it.

WNU Editor:  In the past few months I have noticed this change among many of my Russian family members and friends on the possibility that the US may launch a nuclear first strike against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine worsens for Kyiv. This  Russian defence ministry journal is voicing what many fear Washington will do next.

Update: I take Russian nuclear threats seriously. I completely disagree with this point of view .... Russian Nuclear Threats Are Empty, Part of ‘Information Operation:’ ISW (Newsweek).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Ukraine war: Kyiv orders partial evacuation of liberated city 
Ukraine has ordered some residents to leave Kupiansk, as Russia seeks to re-take the city it left last year. 
Kharkiv's regional authorities said families with children and people "with limited mobility" must leave due to "constant" shelling by Russian forces.

WNU Editor: Kupiansk is a critical rail hub. Russian forces will need to retake this city to deny the Ukrainian army the logistical support that is necessary for Kyiv to supply their forces in the region and northern Donbas. After the fall of Bakhmut, this may become the new battle line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists have discovered a hidden passage inside Egypt's Great Pyramid, the authorities announced on Thursday, part of a seven-year international research project. 
The passage is nine metres (30 feet) in length and more than two metres in width, the antiquities ministry said in a statement.
Egypt's Tourism and Antiquities Minister Ahmed Issa told reporters at the ancient site in Giza also known as the Khufu, or Cheops, pyramid, that the "gabled corridor" with a triangular ceiling "was found on the northern face of the Great Pyramid of King Khufu".
The discovery was part of the ScanPyramids project, launched in 2015 as a collaboration between major universities in France, Germany, Canada and Japan and a group of Egyptian experts.
Archaeologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former antiquities minister, heads the committee supervising the project, which uses advanced technology to visualise hidden parts of the pyramid's interior without having to excavate it.
The technology is a mix of infrared thermography, muon radiography imaging and 3D reconstruction -- all of which the researchers say are non-invasive and non-destructive techniques.
The Great Pyramid is the largest in Giza, standing 146 meters tall, and the only surviving structure of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
Built some 4,500 years ago, it has three known chambers, and like other pyramids in Egypt was intended as a pharaoh's tomb.
Hawass told reporters at the pyramid on Thursday that "there is a great possibility... the tunnel is protecting something. In my opinion, it is protecting the actual burial chamber of King Khufu."
In 2017, ScanPyramids announced the discovery of a passenger plane-sized cavity, the first major structure found inside the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.

Reuters: Russian mercenary chief says Ukraine's Bakhmut is practically surrounded 
(Reuters) -Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary force, said in a video published on Friday that the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was "practically surrounded" by his forces and that Kyiv's forces had only one road left out. 
Prigozhin's men have spearheaded the assault in eastern Ukraine for months. 
Moscow regards Bakhmut, which it calls by its Soviet-era name of Artyomovsk, as a useful stepping stone to seize bigger cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. 
Prigozhin, wearing a military uniform in the video, called on Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to withdraw his forces from the small city.

WNU Editor: The military experts are trust tell me that Russia has now attained fire-control over all roads leading in and out of Bakhmut. I do not know how many Ukrainian soldiers are left in Bakhmut, but it looks like they are going to experience the same fate that Ukrainian soldiers faced in Mariupol. A siege that will go on for the next month or two before there is a mass surrender.

* 65% want leading or major role for U.S. 
 * Republicans much less likely to favor prominent role than in past 
* Most Americans dissatisfied with U.S. position in world 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Sixty-five percent of Americans prefer the U.S. to take the leading (20%) or a major role (45%) in world affairs. This is down from 69% in 2019 and 72% as recently as 2017. The current figure is one percentage point below the prior low from 2011. In almost all years since Gallup first asked the question in 2001, more than seven in 10 Americans have favored a leading or major role for the U.S., including a high of 79% in February 2003.

WNU Editor: The world is a different place today, and many are not sympathetic to Washington. As the world breaks up into multi-polar blocs, there is going to be push-back against the U.S. and its economic/political/military/and social policies. 
My hope is that the foreign policy experts in Washington are smart enough to realize that, and be able to maneuver US foreign policy to safeguard US interests, while respecting what other countries want. This could be a new age for the US on the world stage, or a mess of disputes and conflicts that will only drain the US in both blood and treasure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MOSCOW (Reuters) -A court in Belarus on Friday sentenced Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist Ales Bialiatski to 10 years in prison for financing protests and other crimes, in a case that rights groups say was politically motivated.
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Bialiatski and other activists sentenced in the same trial had been unfairly convicted, calling the verdict "appalling".
"We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice & free them," she said on Twitter.
Prosecutors had asked the Minsk court to give Bialiatski, who denied the charges, a 12-year sentence.
He and three co-defendants were charged with financing protests and smuggling money.
Belarusian state news agency Belta confirmed the sentences, including a decade in jail for Bialiatski.
Aged 60, Bialiatski is a co-founder of the Viasna human rights group and one of the most prominent of hundreds of Belarusians who were jailed during a crackdown on months of anti-government protests that erupted in the summer of 2020 and continued into 2021.
Viasna took a leading role in providing legal and financial assistance to those jailed. Mass demonstrations took place after long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election.
"The allegations against our colleagues are linked to their human rights activity, the Viasna human rights centre's provision of help to the victims of politically motivated persecution," Viasna has said of the case.
Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last October for his work on human rights and democracy, sharing it with Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties.
He had been arrested in 2021 along with two co-workers from Viasna.

Tech Monitor: Could undersea cables be the next casualty of hybrid warfare? 
The UK, Italy and France are all investing in new ships and infrastructure to protect the internet from Russian aggression. Critics argue they’re overreacting.
The Akademik Boris Petrov is officially listed as a research vessel. About 75 metres long and moored, at the time of writing, in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, the ship’s official purpose is to survey the ocean depths. Others believe its role is more nefarious. Labelled a ‘spy ship’ by several UK tabloids, the vessel’s brilliant white silhouette has been variously described as skulking away from the Shetland Islands just after its undersea internet cable connection to the rest of the world was severed, and being forced out of the Netherlands’ territorial waters by that country’s coastguard under suspicion of mapping the underwater infrastructure syphoning natural gas and internet traffic in and out of Western Europe. 
To clarify, the Akademik Boris Petrov has not been officially labelled as a Russian spy vessel by any government, and neither has it been conclusively linked to acts of sabotage or espionage as they pertain to undersea internet cables. But Western capitals are worried.

WNU Editor: The deliberate destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines last year has opened the door that undersea infrastructures are now fair game. To me it is a given that it is only a matter of time before the West's undersea internet infrastructure is targeted as the war in Ukraine escalates.]]></summary>

The war in Ukraine, a shipwreck off Italy’s southern coast that drove home the desperate and dangerous sea journeys of migrants seeking to reach Europe, and a collision between a freight train and a passenger train in Greece were the top stories in Europe and Africa, along with Nigeria's elections. 

This photo gallery highlights some of the most compelling images made or published in the week by The Associated Press from Europe and Africa. 

The selection was curated by Rome-based international photo editor Fabio Polimeni.

Financial Post/Reuters: Russia set to seal up damaged Nord Stream gas pipelines: reports  
Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipes ruptured in unexplained blasts last year  
MOSCOW/FRANKFURT — Russia’s ruptured undersea Nord Stream gas pipelines are set to be sealed up and mothballed as there are no immediate plans to repair or reactivate them, sources familiar with the plans have told Reuters. 
Three of the pipes were ruptured by unexplained blasts in September, and one of the Nord Stream 2 pipes remains intact.  But soaring tensions between Moscow and the West over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had by then already brought Nord Stream 1 to a standstill and prevented its twin, criticized by Washington and Kyiv for increasing Germany’s dependence on Russia, ever coming online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A currency dealer poses for a photo with a U.S dollar bill and the amount being given when converting it into Iranian rials in an exchange shop in Tehran in December 2022.   
Reuters: Iran rial plunges to new lows amid unrest, international isolation 
Iran's currency fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Sunday, amid the country's increasing isolation over its disputed nuclear programme, human rights violations and the supply of drones to Russia. 
The U.S. dollar was fetching as much as 601,500 rials on Iran's unofficial market on Sunday, compared with 575,000 on the previous day and 540,000 on Friday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com. 
Iranian authorities have blamed the currency's fall on "the enemies' plot" to destabilise the Islamic Republic after months of unrest sparked by the death in custody of a young woman on Sept. 16. 
The rial has lost nearly half of its value since the start of nationwide protests, the boldest challenge to theocratic rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Update #2: Free-falling rial leaves Iranians worried about financial future (Al Jazeera)   
WNU Editor: The Iranian government is in a Catch-22 situation. The government provides subsidies and support programs that are not sustainable, but cutting these programs will only fuel more protests. Here is an easy prediction. Currency depreciation and high inflation are not coming down anytime soon.]]></summary>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's government believes China is set to renew a charm offensive targeting "opinion leaders" to win hearts and minds as the island gears up for a presidential election in less than a year, a security agency said in an internal report.
China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, has long taken a carrot and stick approach to the island, threatening it with the prospect of military action while reaching out to those it believes are amenable to Beijing's point of view.
As Taipei and Beijing gradually resume travel links halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan security officials expect China to relaunch an influence campaign that in the past included all-expenses-paid trips to China for Taiwan politicians.
From this month, the campaign will …]]></summary>

   RT:  Pro-Kiev stunt in Baltics goes awry (VIDEO)  
The displays of destroyed Russian tanks somewhat backfired on those behind the project  
Actions in support of Kiev in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania went off script over the weekend as locals started bringing flowers to destroyed Russian tanks that had been put on display in the three nations’ capitals to demonstrate solidarity with Ukraine. 
A video released by RT's video agency Ruptly shows small bouquets of flowers lying on the ground near a burnt-out Russian tank in the Latvian capital of Riga. The destroyed equipment was put on display at one of the central city squares to mark the anniversary of the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev, which started in late February 2022.

Reuters: Lockheed Martin Profits More From War Than Any Other Company on Earth 
With such horrifying images from Ukraine, it is hard to imagine any winners, but there are those who profit from the war, specifically military contractors. U.S. military aid for Ukraine and nearby countries has reached $3.75 billion. Almost all U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine are from our stockpiles and will have to be replaced. This means a huge check to companies making military hardware and software. Lockheed Martin Corp is the largest U.S. defense contractor and the domestic company that profits the most from war. 
The financial opportunity for Lockheed Martin and other large contractors is vast. America’s defense budget will be over $800 billion this year. (Here’s how Ukraine’s newly bolstered tank army compares to Russia’s.) 
Lockheed Martin employs 116,000 people. The company reported a total of $66 billion in revenue in 2022 and a profit of $5.7 billion. It has a backlog of orders that stands at $150 billion. Last year, it was No. 55 on the Fortune 500.

Stamford is the only school in Hong Kong to offer students a comprehensive industry mentorship experience linked to portfolio-building projects to guide students through their final years of secondary education. Whether graduating from Stamford through the IBDP pathway or other diploma options, students leave Stamford as graduates who have already made a mark in the world.    Here are three of the most popular choices from the current 11 Cornerstones Program project options, with more to come in the 2023/2024 academic year.  University Level Engineering As a school focusing heavily on STEMinn (science, technology, engineering, math, and innovation), it is no surprise that one of the most popular offerings is Hong Kong's own TramPlus. Although the iconic "Ding Ding" has a long history, the company is heavily focused on the future, allowing students to get a taste of professional engineering to create the next generation of tram cars. Senior HKUST engineering students and EdTEch and Gifted Education expert Joseph Lin lead the program, which offers high school students a scaled-down version of the HKUST foundation program for first-year engineering. Before embarking on critical Grade 11 and Grade 12 course selections, students experience life as engineers by using the design process and building on existing STEMinn knowledge to ideate and construct prototypes, develop alternatives, select a solution, and refine until the final presentation.

Politico: EU looks to dedicate €1B to howitzer shells for Ukraine 
Europe wants to ensure its funds are specifically channeled to the artillery rounds that Ukraine desperately needs to fight Russia. 
BRUSSELS — In a new blueprint for military support to Ukraine, the European Union will propose that €1 billion should be specifically dedicated to ammunition, particularly 155mm artillery shells, according to a document seen by POLITICO. 
The EU is helping supply Ukraine with arms through an off-budget, inter-governmental cash pot called the European Peace Facility, which is used to reimburse countries that export arms to Ukraine. So far, the facility has disbursed €3.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine, with member countries deciding last December to increase its funding by €2 billion in 2023.

WNU Editor: The expectation is that this plan to ramp up artillery production will be approved during a summit in Brussels on March 23-24.

The Intercept: Pentagon Developed Contingency Plan for War With Iran 
In January, the U.S. and Israel conducted the largest joint military exercise in history. 
The U.S. military allocated spending for secret contingency operations pertaining to an Iran war plan, according to a classified Pentagon budget manual listing emergency and special programs reviewed by The Intercept. 
The contingency plan, code-named “Support Sentry,” was funded in 2018 and 2019, according to the manual, which was produced for the 2019 fiscal year. It classifies Support Sentry as an Iran “CONPLAN,” or concept plan, a broad contingency plan for war which the Pentagon develops in anticipation of a potential crisis.

But what is surprising about this plan is that the Intercept was able to obtain this classified Pentagon budget manual listing these emergency and special programs.]]></summary>

Sputnik: Medvedev: Delivery of NATO Aircraft to Kiev Will Mean Alliance's War Against Russia 
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The delivery of NATO aircraft to Ukraine and their maintenance on the territory of the alliance will be a direct entry of NATO into the war against Russia, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday. 
Since the 1920s, there has been an understanding that a country can be recognized as a participant in hostilities if, in addition to supplying weapons, it trains personnel to use them, Medvedev recalled. 
"This is how it is happening today: Canadian and German instructors in the EU are already teaching Ukrainian killers how to handle Leopards," Medvedev said on Telegram.

WIESBADEN, Germany (Reuters) - The United States is hosting war planning exercises in Germany for Ukrainian military officers to help them think through upcoming battlefield decisions, officials said on Thursday, ahead of the next phase of the year-old conflict with Russia.
The multi-day, table top exercises have been carried out at a war-gaming facility at a U.S. Army base in Wiesbaden, Germany, where the top U.S. military officer, Army General Mark Milley, visited on Thursday.
U.S. officials declined to talk through the potential battlefield scenarios that Ukrainian military staff were examining during the drills, which involve thought exercises to evaluate potential military courses of action.

This is especially as the "the people there... view themselves as Russian." Simmons noted that "This is the closest that any US news crew has got to the Russian Black Sea Fleet in many many years." He explained that "Vladimir Putin will be determined to defend that port - to not have it take it away from him - he may well do pretty much anything to try to achieve that."

NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons' observations are spot on. The NBC report is here ....

New policies expand transgender procedures to the service academies, allow gender transitions while on-duty, and mandate group shower facility use by both biological sexes if certain administrative requirements are met. Oh, and military commanders are responsible to “not accommodate biases against transgender individuals” 
As RealClear Defense recently reported, on December 20, 2022 the Department of Defense issued an update to DOD Instruction 1300.28, entitled “In-Service Transition for Transgender Service Members,” which “expanded woke transgender mandates in significant ways.”
The article compares the original instruction, issued in the waning days of the Obama administration in October 2016, to the current expansion, with the aide of a study and summary compiled by the Center for Military Readiness (CMR).
Significantly, the CMR study and summary explain the significance of  the changes, which fall into six major areas, and which were issued  “without public debate”:

B92: No manpower, no weapons... And Berlin would fall  
New German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Monday that Germany's military is not ready to defend the country if it is attacked.  
"We do not have armed forces capable of defending the country against a brutal offensive and an aggressive war," he said, during a meeting with members of his Social Democratic Party (SPD). 
According to him, Germany's Bundeswehr armed forces are undermanned thanks to decades of neglect by the federal government. Therefore, he believes that Germany will have to invest much more in defense in order to reach NATO standards. 
The highest-ranking officer of the Bundeswehr, Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, confirmed Pistorius's words in fact, when he declared that even the 100 billion euros earmarked for the German army by Chancellor Olaf Scholz will not be enough for the Bundeswehr to be capable of waging war.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wearing flamboyant costumes and masks imitating blue-eyed, bearded Europeans, carnival-goers in Mexico have turned mocking colonizers into an art form.
The colorful celebration stands out from hundreds of other carnivals in Latin America by rekindling the spirit of revenge against erstwhile invaders.
Each year, men in wooden masks playing the role of light-skinned Europeans dance through the streets of Tlaxcala, one of Mexico's smallest states, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of the capital Mexico City.
Many sport carefully-trimmed beards resembling those of Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes, while others have mustaches.
Participants in the photogenic festivities recreate the dandy style of the people who crossed the Atlantic to the New World.
Women wear the flowing dresses and elaborate hats of European ladies centuries ago.
The aim is to "mock the invaders... especially their customs and habits, which for the people of Tlaxcala were very effeminate," tourist guide Eduardo Cuautle Xochitemotl said beneath a mural depicting local history.
The feather-topped masks, hand-embroidered clothes and European-style costumes are a celebration of the cultural collisions that have shaped the region.
The Tlaxcalans allied with Cortes to capture the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan -- today Mexico City -- in 1521.
While their collaboration assured them certain privileges, the Tlaxcalans still faced exclusion by powerful Spanish landowners.
"At the time when we were conquered, the big haciendas held huge parties with music and dance, which we, the indigenous people, could not enter," said dancer Carlos Gomez Vazquez.
Another target of the mockery is the French influence that took root in the late 19th century under general-turned-president Porfirio Diaz, whose legacy can be seen today in Mexico City's Parisian-style architecture.
And in modern-day Mexico, centuries-old foes are not the only subjects of ridicule.
"Nowadays the tradition is to mock today's politicians," Xochitemotl said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Belgian woman who murdered her five children in a case that shocked the country has been euthanised at her own request, 16 years to the day after their killing, her lawyer said Thursday.
Genevieve Lhermitte slit the throats of her son and four daughters aged three to 14 with a kitchen knife at the family home in the town of Nivelles on February 28, 2007 while their father was away.
She then tried to commit suicide by stabbing herself, but the attempt failed and she ended up calling the emergency services.
Lhermitte was sentenced to life in prison in 2008, before being moved to a psychiatric hospital in 2019.
The 56-year-old's lawyer Nicolas Cohen confirmed to AFP reports in local media that his client had died through euthanasia on the sixteenth anniversary of the killings on Tuesday.

Politico:  Why Can’t Democrats Explain Themselves on China?  
Biden has yet to find the rhetoric to describe his views on America’s global rival — and that’s a big problem. 
President Joe Biden likes to sum up his approach to China with a snappy mantra: “Competition, not conflict.” He used that construction at the G-20 summit last fall in Bali, Indonesia, after meeting with Xi Jinping to revive their strained relationship. Biden deployed it again in his State of the Union address this month, days after sending warplanes to destroy a Chinese spy balloon off the Atlantic coast.

        <updated>2023-03-02T14:58:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South African Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius, who killed his girlfriend 10 years ago, will know in about a month whether he will be released on parole, his lawyer said Thursday.
"We have been advised by the parole board that (the) hearing will take place on the 31st of March, 2023," his lawyer Julian Knight told AFP. "It's an internal process".
Pistorius, 36, shot dead Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 when he fired four times through the bathroom door of his ultra-secure Pretoria house.
He pleaded not guilty and denied that he killed Steenkamp in a rage, saying he mistook her for a burglar.
Pistorius, known worldwide as the "Blade Runner" because of his carbon-fibre prosthetics, was sentenced to 13 years behind bars.
Offenders in South Africa are automatically eligible for parole consideration after serving half of their sentence. Pistorius has served more than half.
A decision is usually known the same day of the parole hearing or a day later, and "if the decision is negative, the offender has the right to approach the courts for review," said Knight.
A year before killing Steenkamp, Pistorius became the first double-amputee to race at the Olympics at the London 2012 games.
He was initially sentenced to six years in jail but the sentence was later lengthened to 13 after the state appealed that it was unduly lenient.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources. 
The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions.

Global Times: PLA Navy holds 1st amphibious assault ship far sea drills in West Pacific 
The Hainan, the first Type 075 amphibious assault ship of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, recently joined a flotilla and conducted a far sea exercise in the West Pacific, marking the first time that China has held an expeditionary voyage with a warship of this type. 
Such drills displayed the vessel's high level of combat readiness and the PLA Navy's amphibious landing capabilities in carrying out traditional security missions as well as non-traditional ones like anti-terrorism and humanitarian aid, analysts said on Thursday. 
The far sea joint training flotilla under the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy recently returned to base after successfully carrying out a combat training mission in the South China Sea and the West Pacific over 30 days and across more than 9,000 nautical miles, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Thursday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Controversial legal reforms being debated in Israel's parliament have sparked fears in the high-tech and financial sectors that foreign investors will be scared off in a blow to growth prospects.
The new legislation has been spearheaded by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which took office in December and is regarded as the most right-wing in Israeli history.
It aims to curtail the powers of the Supreme Court and give politicians greater powers over the selection of judges.
The proposals could deal a "severe blow to the economy", former Bank of Israel governors have warned in the country that dubs itself the "start-up nation".
Writing recently in the top-selling Yediot Aharonot newspaper, former governors Karnit Flug and Jacob Frenkel acknowledged the situation "is stil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, one of Denmark's most iconic landmarks, was vandalised overnight Thursday with a Russian flag painted across the statue's base.
The colors of Russia's flag had been painted on the stone where the statue rests of the heroine from Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen's famous novel, an AFP journalist saw.
Copenhagen police told AFP they had been at the scene in the morning and recorded "a case of vandalism."
"Investigations have been carried out in the area in order to find traces," police added.
An investigation had been opened into act, an apparent sign of support for Moscow in the midst of its war in Ukraine.
A few puzzled tourists photographed the vandalized statue on Thursday morning.
The Little Mermaid -- inspired by a character in Danish poet and author Andersen's 1837 fairytale of the same name -- is a 175-kilogram (385-pound) statue by sculptor Edvard Eriksen.
The statue, which sits on a relatively secluded waterfront promenade, has been vandalized numerous times over the years -- including when the mermaid's head was stolen in 1964 and 1998, as well as when an arm was cut off in 1984.
In 1998, vandals cut off its head again, but it was later returned, before the statue was blown up in 2003.
It has been tagged and painted many times, most recently in 2020 with the mysterious inscription "Racist fish".

        <updated>2023-03-02T11:39:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the announcement of his indefinite touring hiatus, Justin Bieber's tour dates appear ultimately to be scrapped, with fan sites and ticketing outlets reporting cancellations.
All of his concerts, including in the United States, Ireland and France, are marked as cancelled on Ticketmaster's website.
Neither Bieber, 29, nor his representatives have provided reasons for or official confirmation of the cancellations.
The superstar announced he was taking a break from performing last year, saying he'd been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, a rare complication of shingles that for him caused partial facial paralysis.
"I need to make my health the priority right now," he said at the time.
"I'm going to be OK, but I need time to rest and get better. I've been so proud to bring this show and our message of justice to the world."
Bieber had dozens of performances across the globe scheduled through March 2023. 
Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can inflame and paralyze the facial nerve and cause a painful rash around the ear or mouth. In addition to facial paralysis, it can cause hearing loss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Exclusive: US Air Force fires leaders for failing nuclear safety inspection 
Two US Air Force commanders and four of their subordinates at a key nuclear base in North Dakota were relieved of duty this week after their units failed an inspection designed to ensure that the nuclear weapons stockpile is safe and secure at all times, two defense officials told CNN. 
The removals occurred at Minot Air Force Base, which is the only Air Force installation that houses two legs of the “nuclear triad” – ballistic missile silos and strategic bombers. 
The officials told CNN that the six service members were relieved of duty following the failed nuclear surety inspection at the base.  The nuclear surety inspection is a pass/fail test and the results are classified. 
There is no indication that the failed inspection was related to the handling of a nuclear weapon itself. Another defense official said the failure was for “non-compliance vehicle and equipment safety inspections.”

Update #2: Air Force relieves 2 commanders, 4 leaders at North Dakota nuclear bomber, missile base (FOX News).   
WNU Editor: The way these firings were handled makes me wonder if there is some psychological vetting happening within the US Air Force right now??]]></summary>

Reuters: Iran can make fissile material for a bomb 'in about 12 days' - U.S. official 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran could make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in "about 12 days," a top U.S. Defense Department official said on Tuesday, down from the estimated one year it would have taken while the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was in effect. 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl made the comment to a House of Representatives hearing when pressed by a Republican lawmaker why the Biden administration had sought to revive the deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). 

 "Because Iran's nuclear progress since we left the JCPOA has been remarkable. Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one bomb's worth of fissile material. Now it would take about 12 days," Kahl, the third ranking Defense Department official, told lawmakers.

The latest body to be found was that of a five-year-old boy, one of more than a dozen children who lost their lives on Sunday morning.
Weeping women were led among the rows of coffins laid out in a sports hall in the southern Italian seaside town of Crotone, some kneeling to pray quietly, while others howled in grief.
After a group prayer, men and women hugged and caressed the flower-adorned coffins, one man sobbing as he touched a stuffed Tigger toy, while others fainted and were carried out by Red Cross workers.
Outside, relatives who had come over from countries including Germany and Austria, described final…]]></summary>

Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says Ukraine will become a member of the alliance in the "long-term", but for now it needs to remain independent in the face of Russia's invasion. 
Ukraine has sought to join the US-led military alliance for years. 
After Russia's invasion of the country, President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for that request to be fast-tracked. 
Ukraine also applied for EU membership days after Russia invaded, and gained candidate status in June. 
"Nato allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a member of our alliance, but at the same time that is a long-term perspective," Mr Stoltenberg told reporters during a visit to Finland's capital, Helsinki.

And two, Ukraine continues to be strung alone with the carrot of one day becoming a NATO member, even being invited to the next NATO summit ....

WNU Editor: Bottom line. Ukraine will not get any F-16s, and maybe other weapons will be limited.

Reuters: Zelenskiy Fires a Top Ukrainian Military Commander, No Reason Given 
(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday fired a senior military commander helping lead the fight against Russian troops in the country's embattled east but gave no reason for the move. 
In a one-line decree, Zelenskiy announced the dismissal of Eduard Moskalyov as commander of the joint forces of Ukraine, which are engaged in battles in the Donbas region. 
Zelenskiy mentioned Moskalyov in a daily address on Friday when listing the military commanders he had spoken to.

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
