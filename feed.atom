Daily Mail: White House demands more information after Israel 'used US-made white phosphorous during attack on Lebanon that injured nine' 
* Israel has used white phosphorous in attacks on southern Lebanon 
* Rights groups say that on at least one occasion it amounted to a war crime 
* Now an investigation reveals the munitions were supplied by the US 
The White House is concerned about allegations that Israel used white phosphorus supplied by the U.S. during an attack in southern Lebanon, a spokesman said Monday. 
Weapons packed with white phosphorous are not banned under international law but are tightly regulated because of the way they can cause horrific burns. 
An investigation published Monday accused the U.S. of supplying munitions that wounded nine civilians in an attack in October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: The huge missile barrage on Ukraine that Russia has been saving up for seems to have begun 
* Analysts have long said Russia was keeping missiles and bombs in reserve for winter. 
* Winter is here — and a Russian barrage has begun right on cue. 
* The UK MOD said Russia's heavy bomber fleet has been active. 
Its target is likely Ukraine's energy network.

Russia appears to have started a major bombing campaign on Ukraine after holding back for months to build its stockpiles. 
The UK Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that a cruise missile attack last Thursday was "probably the start of a more concerted campaign by Russia aimed at degrading Ukraine's energy infrastructure." 
The missiles "were highly likely AS-23a KODIAK," Russia's premier air-launched cruise missile, the MOD said.

"Russia has almost certainly been stockpiling these missiles for use in the winter campaign," it said.

Argentina's new far-right president has vowed to deliver economic "shock treatment" in his first speech after formally taking office. 
Javier Milei warned Argentines "there is no money" and recommitted to a programme of harsh austerity measures. 
The populist outsider won a surprise election victory in November with radical pledges to overhaul the South American nation's ailing economy. 
Mr Milei's inauguration was held in Buenos Aires on Sunday.
In a day of pomp and ceremony, the 53-year-old capped his extraordinary rise to power with a speech which left Argentines in no doubt he intends to embark on an economic path unlike any previous president.

        <updated>2023-12-11T17:46:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French lawmakers sent the government’s immigration bill back to the drawing board on Monday, in a surprise move that cut short debates at the lower house and dealt a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to pass laws without a majority.
Lawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far right party as well as many conservatives joined forces to reject the bill on its first day in the National Assembly, adopting a motion proposed by the Greens, which passed by just two votes.
The rejection does not mean the government needs to resign and does not signal the end of the immigration bill.
The government can now decide to send it back to the upper house, send it to a joint committee of senators and deputies to find a compromise, or pull it, which is unlikely.
It can also use special executive powers to force its adoption without a vote.
The immigration bill has been a key plank of Macron’s attempts to show he can be tougher on law and order issues while keeping France’s doors open to foreign workers who can help the French economy.
But short of a majority in parliament, he has struggled to pass a bill that has strict provisions disliked by left-wing lawmakers and more liberal aspects criticised by some conservatives and the far right.
The government has presented the bill as essential to expel foreign criminals more easily. One provision removes a ban on expelling those migrants who arrived in France before the age of 13, as was the case for the alleged Russian-born Islamist militant who killed a French teacher in October.
Other provisions that have been hotly debated are whether non-EU migrants should continue to get access to free medical coverage in France, as well as the government’s aim to facilitate the legalisation of workers in industries suffering from labour shortages such as cafes and restaurants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diamonds in the dust – a ring worth 750,000 euros ($807,000), which went missing at the luxury Ritz hotel in Paris, has been found in a vacuum cleaner.
The ring went missing on Friday and its owner suspected hotel staff of theft.
On Sunday, it was found in a vacuum cleaner bag after police launched an investigation, the Ritz said.
The hotel told AFP the ring had been found “thanks to the meticulous search work carried out by our security guards.”
“Our client is delighted with this news,” the hotel was quoted as saying.
The owner, described as a Malaysian businesswoman, went to the police on Friday after discovering that her ring, left on the table in her room, had disappeared.
On Saturday, she left Paris for London but was expected to return to the French capital to retrieve her ring, Le Parisien newspaper said.
It said the Ritz had offered her three nights’ accommodation as compensation but the businesswoman had no intention of taking advantage of the offer.

Daily Mail:  Chinese-affiliated hacking groups infiltrated critical American infrastructure, including Hawaii water utility and at least one oil and gas pipeline, US officials say 
* More than two dozen high-value targets have been attacked in the last year alone as China seeks to inflict 'societal chaos' in the event of war 
* Beijing is by-passing hi-tech firewalls by targeting ordinary employees 
* It comes as tensions grow over Taiwan, with targets in Hawaii and Guam at the top of the Chinese hit list 
Chinese hackers are positioning themselves inside critical US infrastructure by targeting careless office workers in a bid to cause 'societal chaos' from within should war break out. 
Beijing's military have burrowed into more than 20 major suppliers in the last year alone including a water utility in Hawaii, a major West Coast port and at least one oil and gas pipeline, analysts have revealed. 
They have bypassed elaborate cyber security systems by intercepting passwords and log-ins unguarded by junior employees, leaving China 'sitting on a stockpile of strategic' vulnerabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Hong Kong’s largest self-funded university, Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU), today held an Honorary Degrees Ceremony in which honorary doctorates were conferred on four distinguished recipients. This followed the conclusion of the winter session of its 2023 Congregation last week.  Up-to-date professional degree programmes These new honorary degree-holders have joined a university that next year will be celebrating its 35th anniversary. Although this is young in institutional terms, HKMU has come far in its short span. Just two years ago it embraced a new name, part of a larger move to push beyond its traditional strengths in parttime and distance education and attract full-time undergraduates by offering a larger number of professional degree programmes.  One of these new popular new programmes is Physiotherapy, backed by a superbly equipped Physiotherapy Centre that also provides services for the local community. Another is Medical Laboratory Science, a sought-after discipline supported by a new 7,000 sq.ft. laboratory that caters to teaching and research across five major medical disciplines. Elsewhere, HKMU has drawn on a HK$73.9 million grant from the Government’s Enhancement and Start-up Grant Scheme for Self-financing Post-secondary Education to launch degree programmes in two other fields of high demand: Construction Management and Quantity Surveying, and New Music and Interactive Entertainment.    All HKMU new programmes are being designed to embrace the latest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. As HKMU President Prof. Paul Lam notes, “For students, AI literacy will be one of the most important skills of the future, and it’s our University’s job to ensure they have it.” Existing programmes are also being “retrofitted” with AI components to realise this vision.  Productive industry partnerships These new programmes are turning out ever-increasing numbers of skilled graduates, and the University…]]></summary>

The Hill: US calls on China to stop ‘dangerous’ actions in South China Sea after Philippine vessel rammed 
The U.S. slammed China for “reckless disregard” and provocative action after Chinese coast guard boats shot water cannons at Philippine ships and collided with a vessel in the South China Sea over the weekend. 
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Chinese boats also deployed acoustic devices, or sound cannons, which can employ extremely loud sounds over a distance to incapacitate a target, to drive away Philippine boats.

Nearly half of voters in a new survey said the United States is spending too much on aid for Ukraine, which comes just ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Washington. 
The Financial Times-Michigan Ross poll found that 48 percent of voters said the U.S. was spending “too much” on sending financial and military aid to Ukraine. Twenty-seven percent said the U.S. was spending the right amount, and 11 percent said the U.S. was not spending enough. 
Republicans were more likely to say the U.S. is spending too much, with 65 percent saying so. About half of independent voters and 32 percent of Democrats said the U.S. was spending too much.

The 46-year-old is fleeing to Spain after realising her legal rights as one of two mothers of three-year-old Arturo are no longer safe under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
"It's a nightmare," she told AFP, saying she and Christine, 42, are braced to leave friends, family and her job in Rome "because it's the only escape route".
Civil unions became legal in Italy in 2016, but the law on parental rights for same-sex couples is unclear.
Encouraged by several court rulings, local mayors have in recent years been registering both biological and non-biological parents on birth certificates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders appeared Monday to have persuaded his preferred coalition partners to keep negotiating but reportedly major "stumbling blocks" remain over his hardline anti-Islam, anti-European views.
Wilders delivered a political earthquake in the Netherlands and across Europe last month by handily winning elections and putting his PVV Freedom Party in pole position to form a government.
Unlike Britain and the United States for example, the Netherlands has a hugely fragmented political system that means no one party ever enjoys a parliamentary majority.
Wilders has struggled to convince other party leaders to join his government, as they are put off by elements of his party's manifesto seen as unconstitutional, such as banning mosques and the Koran.

The main areas of concern are the environmental issues around the surfing venue in Tahiti, the safety of the unprecedented opening ceremony on the Seine, the efficiency of public transport in the Paris region and, of course, the shadow of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- Public transport mess -
The anger and irritation that has shrouded journeys for Paris commuters over the last 18 months has spilled into the political arena.
In mid-November the city's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo declared that the transport system in the city would "not be ready" for the summer of 2024.

Satellites vital for infrastructure, economy, and security are filling up the thousands of miles above the Earth’s surface. With this crowding comes an increase in close approaches between satellites, placing communications, navigation, weather monitoring, missile warning, and other satellites at risk.  There are many reasons to fear close approaches — also known as conjunctions — in space, even if they are accidental. From a safety perspective, accidental satellite collisions could produce thousands of pieces of long-lived debris, as happened when an

WNU Editor: Pepe Escobar in the above post is giving a description of Russia that I am always hearing from my friends/contacts/and family members in Russia. Needless to say the above observations are completely opposite to what the Western media is saying is happening in Russia. 

 
Update: The Duran gives a good analysis in the video below on how Putin was recently treated in his last trip to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.. Putin may be ostracized in the West, but he is more than welcomed in other countries.]]></summary>

President Biden will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House this week, the administration announced Sunday, as Congress looks increasingly unlikely to pass additional funding for Ukraine and as U.S. officials warn that the country will run out of money by the end of the year to fight against Russia’s invasion. 
Zelensky also will meet with some congressional leaders on Tuesday. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) invited Zelensky to speak to senators Tuesday morning, according to a Senate leadership aide. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) will also meet with Zelensky, spokesman Raj Shah said on X, formerly Twitter.

 Sustained Western aid to Ukraine will compel Russia to negotiate on terms favorable to Kyiv by the end of 2024, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jonathan Finer said on Dec. 8. 
"We want to position Ukraine in such a way by the end of next year that Russia will have to decide whether to come to the negotiating table with conditions acceptable to Ukraine..., or confront a stronger Ukraine," Finer said at the Aspen Security Forum, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine.
Finer believes that a more robust industrial base in the United States and Europe, which will enhance the capabilities of both the U.S. and Ukrainian military industries, will help power a new counteroffensive.

A senior UN aid official has warned that half of Gaza's population is starving, as fighting there continues. 
Carl Skau, deputy director of the UN World Food Programme, said only a fraction of supplies needed have been able to enter the Strip - and nine out of 10 people cannot eat everyday. 
Conditions in Gaza have made deliveries "almost impossible", Mr Skau said.

Israel says it must continue air strikes on Gaza to eliminate Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home.

Civilian proportion of deaths is higher than the average in all world conflicts in 20th century, data suggests 
The aerial bombing campaign by Israel in Gaza is the most indiscriminate in terms of civilian casualties in recent years, a study published by an Israeli newspaper has found. 
The analysis in Haaretz came as Israeli forces fought to consolidate their control of northern Gaza on Saturday, bombing the Shejaiya district of Gaza City, while also conducting airstrikes on Rafah, a town on the southern border with Egypt where the Israeli army has told people in Gaza to take shelter.

He's facing new criminal charges that accuse him of failing to pay his taxes, when spending big on his luxurious lifestyle. 

Hunter has evaded more than $1.4 million in taxes while funding his extravagant lifestyle which includes drugs, escorts, cars and luxury hotels. 

Curtin University's Dean of Global Futures Professor Joe Siracusa believes the president’s son won’t “get off” on the fresh charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fresh indictment against Hunter Biden will have broken the “spirit” of US President Joe Biden, says Curtin University's Dean of Global Futures Professor Joe Siracusa. 

The President’s son is facing a total of nine criminal charges, which accuse him of failing to pay his taxes when spending big on his luxurious lifestyle. 

Hunter has evaded more than $1.4 million in taxes while funding his extravagant lifestyle, which includes drugs, escorts, cars and luxury hotels. 

“This, I think, finishes off the Biden administration – Biden is weary,” Professor Siracusa told Sky News Australia. 

“There’s going to be a hell of a race to replace him in the Democratic Party.”]]></summary>

Participants braved the cold and ran through the streets shouting, ‘ho ho ho’. 

They also stopped over in several spots to sing and dance to the surprise of tourists.

Organisers say they were inspired by a similar marathon in Boston.

Funds raised will be donated to a children’s charity.]]></summary>

Nobody believed him. He wrote in a very long book. People read that book. They still did not believe it. And then he went ahead and executed his plan. And Trump is doing exactly the same thing."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration has used an emergency authority to allow the sale of about 14,000 tank shells to Israel without congressional review, the Pentagon said on Saturday. 
The State Department on Friday used an Arms Export Control Act emergency declaration for the tank rounds worth $106.5 million for immediate delivery to Israel, the Pentagon said in a statement. 
The shells are part of a bigger sale that was first reported by Reuters on Friday that the Biden administration is asking the U.S. Congress to approve. 
The larger package is worth more than $500 million and includes 45,000 shells for Israel's Merkava tanks, regularly deployed in its offensive in Gaza, which has killed thousands of civilians.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, who has claimed his home was targeted by a break-in shortly after he published a scathing "Anonymous" op-ed about Trump's presidency, appeared on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta on Saturday. Acosta asked if the things Trump says he will do in a second term, such as mass deportations, another Muslim ban, and firings across the federal government, are realistic.


	"It's not a stretch at all. This is how Stephen Miller, likely to be one of Trump's cabinet secretaries in a second term, described the second term to me. He specifically described day one to me: 'On day one, when we win, it will be a shock and awe blitz.' You have to take him at his word," Taylor said. "What does Stephen Miller mean by that? He means in a second go-around, there won't be years of delay and indecision about whether to moderate Trump's position so he can win a second term. It will be throwing the kitchen sink at American democracy and doing all the things he's wanted to do by abusing federal power."

	Taylor went on to say that his biggest worry is the potential weaponization of the national security community.

	"If you look anywhere in history you see the most grievous abuses of power is when the army or domestic security forces are used against a leader's political enemies. And those are things that aren't just forecasts of what Trump could do. He's talked about weaponizing the spy community, to spy on his adversaries. He has talked about creating his own mercenary force within the community so he doesn't have to go through a chain of command that he worries would disobey him. He's talked about using the Department of Homeland Security to intimidate his opponents in democratic sanctuary cities and to make sure that blue states don't get aid and red states do when there's natural disasters. This is laid out very clear. We know what will happen."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[G7 summit leaders appear on a monitor during a video conference with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Dec. 6. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Service)

 
Business Insider: Putin believes Ukraine will fall within just months without new US aid, says Senate Intelligence Chair 
* Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner said Putin believes that Ukraine will fall in just months. 
* Warner drew his assessment from US intelligence after senators blocked a $175 million aid package. 
* "Vladimir Putin's hopes for victory rest on the US walking away from Ukraine," he said. 
Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner said Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine will fall within just months without renewed US military aid. 
Sen. Warner asked, "Why, at this moment in time, would we prove Putin right?" 
Warner made the statement on Wednesday after the Senate failed to hit the 60-vote threshold required to advance a new "crucial" military aid package to Ukraine. 
"Vladimir Putin's hopes for victory rest on the US walking away from Ukraine," Warner wrote.

WNU Editor: I do not know where U.S. Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner gets his intelligence. But I do know in Russia the expectation is that even if the West stops providing aid to Ukraine in the coming weeks, there is more than enough weapons and ammo in Ukraine to keep the war going on for a very long time. 
As to what is my take. 
Ukraine does not have the manpower to continue the war and accomplish its goal of expelling Russian military forces out of Ukraine. This new US aid, which I believe will be approved by the US Congress, will only prolong the slaughter.

 
Update: He is on a roll (for now) .... As Ukraine struggles with fickle allies, Vladimir Putin is on a roll (CBC News).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Saturday was accused of "fearmongering" by an ex-CIA official and others when she blamed Joe Biden for a hypothetical terrorist attack.
Greene, who was recently called a hypocrite for saying Biden was scared to debate without noting her chosen candidate Donald Trump has taken similar positions, used social media to push blame on the president for a purported terrorist attack she apparently expects to occur because of the shared Mexico border.
On her congressional account, Greene posted her assessment of who would be "entirely to blame" if there was a terrorist attack on American soil.
"If God forbid, there is a terrorist attack in America, the Biden Administration is entirely to blame [because] of the border!!!" Greene exclaimed.

Business Insider: A Ukrainian soldier says he stopped shelling small Russian units because he is running out of US-made artillery ammo 
* A Ukrainian soldier says he stopped shelling small Russian units, per The Times of London. 
* Sergeant Taras "Fizruk" told the newspaper his unit is running out of US-made artillery shells. 
* The US and NATO have struggled to keep pace with Ukraine's use of ammunition. 
A Ukrainian soldier said he stopped shelling small Russian units because his brigade was running out of US-provided artillery ammunition, per The Times of London. 
"When it's two or three soldiers, I'm not shooting any more; only when it's a critical situation, say, ten guys close to our infantry, we will work," Sergeant Taras "Fizruk" told the newspaper. 
The 31-year-old mortar gunner said that he and his comrades from the 47th Mechanized Brigade "had ten times more ammunition over the summer." per the newspaper.

WNU Editor: I have been reading reports like the one above since September on how dire the ammo and equipment shortage is for the Ukraine Army on the front-lines. Especially the shortage of artillery pieces and shells. But this is the wish list that Kyiv wants from Washington .... Ukraine's ambitious US weapons wish list includes F-18 Hornet fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and giant transport planes (Business Insider).]]></summary>

Bloomberg: US Army Says It’s Not Yet Strained by Supplying Both Israel and Ukraine 
 (Bloomberg) -- US Army ammunition and equipment inventories aren’t yet being strained by supplying both Israel and Ukraine the Army’s top weapons buyer said Thursday, although he warned that could change as the conflicts drag on. 
“We’ve done munitions of many types, for everything from helicopters to artillery” for Israel, Douglas Bush, assistant secretary for acquisition, said at a conference in Washington. “But nothing where it was so far, at least, a direct competition with what was already planned to go to Ukraine.”

Bloomberg: US Won’t Rule Out Military Action Against Houthis, Official Says 
A top White House official said the US won’t rule out the possibility of strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which have been blamed for targeting commercial ships, while it focuses now on sanctions and security at sea. 
“We have certainly not ruled out the possibility of taking military action — we reserve that right,” Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told the Aspen Security Forum in Washington on Thursday. For the time being, the US will focus on “a maritime coalition to provide reassurance and security for commercial sea lanes,” he said. 

“And if there is a decision to escalate against us, we will look at other options,” Finer said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flattery, gifts, and more are on the table when it comes to European officials dealing with a theoretical future president Donald Trump, according to a report published on Saturday.
Trump has bucked historically consistent concepts when it comes to dealing with European nations, including a rejection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, "America’s most important military alliance," according to the New York Times. Trump has said repeatedly that withdrawing from NATO would save the U.S. money.
That's causing some panic abroad, according to the Times.
"In interviews over the past several months, more than a half-dozen current and former European diplomats — speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from Mr. Trump should he win — said alarm was rising on Embassy Row and among their home governments that Mr. Trump’s return could mean not just the abandonment of Ukraine, but a broader American retreat from the continent and a gutting of the Atlantic alliance," the article states.

The Times quoted James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral who was NATO’s supreme allied commander until 2013, as saying there is a "great fear" in Europe about Trump's tentative plans.
It also reported that most officials were simply "out of ideas" when it comes to the Don.
"The interviews with current and former diplomats revealed that European officials were mostly out of ideas for how to deal with Mr. Trump other than returning to a previous playbook of flattery and transactional tributes," the article says. "Smaller countries that are more vulnerable to Russian attacks are expected to try to buy their way into Mr. Trump’s good graces by increasing their orders of American weapons or — as Poland did during his term — by performing grand acts of adulation, including offering to name a military base Fort Trump in return for his placing a permanent presence there."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
