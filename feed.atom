Reuters: Poland says Germany refused talks on World War Two reparations 
WARSAW (Reuters) -Germany has rebuffed the latest push by Poland's nationalist government for vast reparations over World War Two, saying in response to a diplomatic note that the issue was closed, the foreign ministry in Warsaw said on Tuesday. 
A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said it had responded to a letter sent by Poland on the subject in October and did not comment on the contents of diplomatic correspondence. 
Poland estimates its World War Two losses caused by Germany at 6.2 trillion zlotys ($1.4 trillion) and has demanded reparations, but Berlin has repeatedly said all financial claims related to the war have been settled.

SCMP: New Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang vows to prioritise US ties, tweets praise for Americans 
* The outgoing ambassador to Washington says he is seeking a 'better China-US relationship' 
* His promotion is widely seen as an effort by Beijing to stabilise relations between the world powers 
New Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said he was "deeply impressed" by the American people and pledged to continue to push forward the relationship between the two world powers in his new role. 
Qin, who was promoted on Friday, has served as China's ambassador to the US for the past 17 months - a period he described as "a time of severe challenges for China-US relations". 
"I want to pay sincere thanks to the people of the United States for the strong support and assistance given to me and the Chinese Embassy during this period," Qin tweeted on Monday evening Washington time.

Murat Aslan & Tanya Goudsouzian, Middle East Eye:  Russia-Ukraine war: Are we about to see a new kind of 'super-combat'?  
Demands of high-intensity modern warfare are rapidly depleting the weapons and resources of all parties in Ukraine. What might come next should worry us all 
In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine in what many analysts predicted would be a quick regime change of the Zelensky government in Kyiv. 
The Kremlin expected a short operation, like the Crimea takeover of 2014 or, at worst, low-level warfare similar to the Syria conflict, with some cities resembling Aleppo by the end. Instead, what Russia and the world have seen is a protracted, gory conflict and a return to high-intensity warfare on a scale not seen since the Second World War. 
The scale and scope of modern precision intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) technology, along with the use of mid-20th-century tactics, has seen a dramatic increase in the degree of battlefield destruction.

WNU Editor: The Kremlin has woken up to the possibility that they may run out of weapons and resources for this war, hence we now have this .... Russia's Military Factories Are Now Working ‘Around the Clock’ (January 2, 2023). 
Here is a prediction. I expect in the coming weeks/months the West will also be rushing in measures to have their military factories churning out weapons and military resources 24/7.]]></summary>

Ukrainian News: Defense Intelligence Constantly Monitoring Movement Of Russia's Nuclear Weapons 
Russia has both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons in its arsenal, but Ukraine's military intelligence is aware of all its storage sites and constantly monitors its movement. 
The representative of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Vadym Skibitskyi announced this on the air of the national telethon, Ukrainian News Agency reports. 
"First, we know all the places of storage. Secondly, we know the number and location of the carriers of nuclear weapons of the tactical level. We constantly track all movements of all the carriers. We follow the active events that the Twelfth Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation can conduct or conducts. It is it that is responsible for the preparation and delivery of nuclear charges to weapons," he said.

Update: Ukrainian intelligence monitors movement and preparation of nuclear weapons in Russia (Espresso)   
WNU Editor: I am skeptical of this report. Ukraine does not have spy satellites. They may have operatives in Russia itself, but Russia is a huge place, and I doubt that Ukraine has the resources on the ground to watch everything when it comes to Russia's nuclear forces. What is more believable is that it is the US that is feeding Ukraine all of this information.]]></summary>

Reuters: Anger in Russia as scores of troops killed in one of Ukraine war's deadliest strikes 
KYIV (Reuters) -Russia acknowledged on Monday that scores of its troops were killed in one of the Ukraine war's deadliest strikes, drawing demands from Russian nationalist bloggers for commanders to be punished for housing soldiers alongside an ammunition dump. 
Russia's defence ministry said 63 soldiers had died in the fiery blast which destroyed a temporary barracks in a former vocational college in Makiivka, twin city of the Russian-occupied regional capital of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. 
It said the accommodation had been hit by four rockets fired from U.S.-made HIMARS launchers, claiming two rockets had been shot down. 
Kyiv said the Russian death toll was in the hundreds, though pro-Russian officials called this an exaggeration. 
 Russian military bloggers said the huge destruction was a result of storing ammunition in the same building as a barracks, despite commanders knowing it was within range of Ukrainian rockets.

 WNU Editor: Reuters is only getting part of the above story correct. Russian mil-bloggers are demanding that commanders be punished for placing their soldiers in harms way. But the real anger and calls for revenge, from what I see on Russian social media, is directed at the Ukraine government and its military. For the propagandists in the Kremlin who are responsible for maintaining Russian public support for this war, their job has just gotten easier.]]></summary>

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is not discussing joint nuclear exercises with South Korea, President Joe Biden said on Monday, contradicting remarks by his South Korean counterpart as tensions flare with North Korea.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol had said that Seoul and Washington are discussing possible joint exercises using U.S. nuclear assets, while North Korean leader Kim Jong Un branded the South its "undoubted enemy". 
"No," Biden said when asked by reporters at the White House if he was currently discussing joint nuclear exercises with South Korea. 
He had just returned from a vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he was accompanied by his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.

   EurAsian Times: 6000 KM Away From Ukraine, Russia Moves Its Nuclear Bomber Fleet From Engels Air Base To The Far East — Reports 
The Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) have reportedly moved its long-range Tu-95 nuclear-capable bombers to a safe location in the far east, days after Ukraine launched a second strike on a Russian Air Force Base. 
Ukrainian government sources have claimed that at least six Tupolev Tu-95 “Bear” aircraft from Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) Long-Range Aviation (LRA) have been transferred from Engels-2 Air Base to Ukrainian-Seryshevo Air Base following three drone strikes in December. 
While Engels-2 is 600 kilometers to the east of Ukrainian-controlled territory, Ukrainka-Seryshevo is over 6,000 kilometers away from Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo credit: U.S. Air Force    
Business Insider: 15 years after 'officially' retiring its first stealth jet, the US Air Force is looking for help to keep the F-117 flying for another decade 
* The US Air Force unveiled its new stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, in December. 
* The B-21 is expected to arrive 40 years after the US's first stealth aircraft, the F-117 Nighthawk. 
* The F-117 was officially retired in 2008, but the Air Force is still putting the stealth jet to use. 
The fuss about the unveiling of the new B-21 stealth bomber has drawn the aviation world's attention, but the B-21's grandfather is still in action. 
When it first flew in the early 1980s, the F-117 Nighthawk was the first operational stealth aircraft. The F-117 has been officially retired for about 15 years, but its retirement has been far from sedentary. The Nighthawk is still being used to train US pilots to counter enemy stealth planes and cruise missiles.
The US Air Force is now making plans to keep some of its Nighthawks flying until at least 2034. A US Air Force Request for Information published this past fall sought companies interested in a potential 10-year contract to provide maintenance for the F-117, beginning in 2024.

   Notes From Poland: Poland condemns Ukraine’s commemoration of wartime nationalist leader Bandera 
After officials and institutions in Ukraine – including the national parliament – marked the birth anniversary of nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, Polish government figures have criticised the commemoration of a man they see as responsible for the genocide of ethnic Poles and Jews. 
Despite Poland and Ukraine having forged an extremely close alliance against Russian aggression this year, remembrance of World War Two history – and in particular the massacre of up to 100,000 Polish civilians by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) – continues to be a bone of contention.

SCMP: Chinese military short of troops trained in hi-tech operations, PLA Daily reveals in rare show of candour 
* Vice-captain of corvette yet to complete training test, military paper says, confirming reports of a lingering talent shortage, especially in the navy 
* In another first, the report cites 'training resources imbalance' and ship maintenance as reasons for the backlog holding up many promotions 
The vice-captain of a warship has yet to complete a key training test, China's military has revealed, in an indirect but rare acknowledgement of its shortage of highly skilled troops. 
The admission, in a recent media report, highlights a core problem as China speeds up the modernisation of the People's Liberation Army - a lack of hi-tech expertise limiting state-of-the-art equipment from use to its full extent, especially in the navy.

Politico: ‘We better watch out’: NASA boss sounds alarm on Chinese moon ambitions 
In an interview with POLITICO, Bill Nelson expressed confidence the U.S. can win the moon race. But he warned there is little time to lose. 
The race to the moon between the United States and China is getting tighter and the next two years could determine who gains the upper hand.

“It is a fact: we’re in a space race,” the former Florida senator and astronaut said in an interview. “And it is true that we better watch out that they don’t get to a place on the moon under the guise of scientific research. And it is not beyond the realm of possibility that they say, ‘Keep out, we’re here, this is our territory.’”

German media has mocked a "tone-deaf" video put out by Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht. She was slammed for discussing the war in Ukraine as people set off fireworks. 
German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht came under fire on Monday for what has been considered a tone-deaf video published on her social media account. 
 Lambrecht shared the video on Instagram, in which she appears on a street in Berlin during chaotic New Year's celebrations. 
Her reflections of the "war raging in the middle of Europe" — in reference to the already 10-month-long war in Ukraine — have been called insensitive with the backdrop of loud fireworks blasting behind her. 
German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel said the address failed to "hit the right tone," instead painting the war as an "exciting professional experience."

Russian missiles and drones have hit Ukraine on New Year's Eve and Day. 
Russia's partial mobilisation programme, ordered in September, showed Moscow had no desire to end the war at present, Mr Stoltenberg told Radio 4's World at One programme.

Will Biden and Trump remain the frontrunners? Will Putin remain in charge of Russia? Will China start a war? These and other forecasts of the year to come.
 This will be the fourth year in a row that the staff of Future Perfect has given itself the task of trying to predict, well, the future. It’s in the name of the section, but forecasting is something that can benefit you as a thinker whether or not you can accurately see what’s to come. As my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote last year, “the most critical skills for forecasting are thinking numerically, being open to changing your mind, updating your beliefs incrementally and frequently instead of in rare big moments, and — most encouragingly — practicing.” Practice makes Future Perfect, in other words.

Insider: CIA staff made a 'suicide pact' to resign if Trump fired director Gina Haspel, former aide says 
* CIA staff pledged to quit if Donald Trump fired its director, Alyssa Farah Griffin said. 
* She spoke about the "suicide pact" in testimony to the January 6 committee. 
* At the time, Trump was said to be considering replacing Gina Haspel with supporter Kash Patel. 
CIA staff had a "suicide pact" to resign if Donald Trump fired director Gina Haspel, a former aide to the president told the House's January 6 select committee. 
Alyssa Farah Griffin said that the threat of a mass walkout stopped Trump from replacing Haspel with supporter Kash Patel, according to transcripts released by the committee in late December. 
"I will share one thing that I cannot confirm myself, but it's worth looking into," said Farah Griffin, a former director of communications at the White House. 
She gave the testimony in April 2022.  "I have been told that they tried to fire Gina Haspel, the CIA director, and install Kash Patel."

WNU Editor: If true. And what we now know from the Twitter files. President Trump should have fired Gina Haspel. The US would be in a far better place today with no blood and vision at the top.
In the end Gina Haspel was replaced (fired?) by the Biden White House. And there was no mass resignation.]]></summary>

Times of Israel: US Air Force temporarily deploys six fighter jets to Israeli airbase  
IAF says that during deployment at Nevatim, American F-15s and Israeli F-35s and spy planes will hold joint drills

According to the IAF, during the deployment at the Nevatim Airbase, the six F-15s would conduct joint drills with Israel’s fleet of F-35 stealth fighters and a squadron of intelligence-gathering Gulfstream G550 planes. 
The drills, set to take place this week, would simulate strikes deep in enemy territory, the IAF said.

Nasrallah canceled a Friday speech after the Lebanese terror group said he had fallen ill with influenza. 
Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was rushed to intensive care after suffering a stroke, according to reports from Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. 
The reports came after Nasrallah canceled a planned Friday speech, with the Lebanese terrorist organization announcing through its affiliated media he had fallen ill with influenza and was unable to speak well. 
Saudi journalist Hussein al-Gawi contradicted Hezbollah's statement, claiming that Nasrallah indeed suffered a second stroke instead of falling ill as was reported. 
The Hezbollah leader was reportedly hospitalized at the Great Prophet Hospital in Beirut.

At the end of a year in which the number of journalists killed in connection with their work rose again, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has compiled and analyzed the figures for journalists killed during the past 20 years – two especially deadly decades for those in the service of the right to inform. 
What with murders, contract killings, ambushes, war zone deaths and fatal injuries, a staggering total of 1,668 journalists have been killed worldwide in connection with their work in the last two decades (2003-2022), according to RSF’s tallies based above all on its annual round-ups. This gives an average of more than 80 journalists killed every year. The total killed since 2000 is 1,787.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: China's President Xi calls for 'unity' and to 'work harder' as country enters 'new phase' in battle against surging Covid infections in his first public address since abandoning his Zero-Covid policy 
* Xi addressed the nation for New Year and made his first comments on Covid 
* China abandoned its stringent, long-held zero-Covid policy earlier this month  
* There has been a considerable 'exit-wave' of infections but Chinese citizens are revelling in their new found freedoms  
Chinese President Xi Jinping today called for unity amid a 'new phase' in its approach to combating the pandemic in his first comments to the public on COVID-19 since abandoning stringent lockdown rules. 
China's abrupt switch earlier this month from the 'zero-COVID' policy that it had maintained for nearly three years has led to infections sweeping across the country unchecked.  
It has also caused a further drop in economic activity and international concern, with Britain and France becoming the latest countries to impose curbs on travellers from China.

A third of the global economy will be in recession this year, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. 
Kristalina Georgieva said 2023 will be "tougher" than last year as the US, EU and China see their economies slow. 
It comes as the war in Ukraine, rising prices, higher interest rates and the spread of Covid in China weigh on the global economy. 
In October the IMF cut its global economic growth outlook for 2023. 
"We expect one third of the world economy to be in recession," Ms Georgieva said on the CBS news programme Face the Nation. 
"Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people," she added.

George Friedman, Geopolitical Futures: The State of Play in Ukraine 
The war in Ukraine seems permanent. Neither side appears capable of destroying the opposing force or articulating what it would take to reach a peace agreement. The Russians are speaking to Belarus, India and anyone else they might find, but no one can help enough on the battlefield or in the munitions factory to turn the tide. The Ukrainians are speaking to the United States, NATO and anyone else who will listen so that they will continue to receive weapons – perhaps even some new ones. But Ukraine hasn’t broken Russia yet, concerned as it is with preventing the collapse of the country, and doing so may prove difficult. On the battlefield, there is movement on both sides, but movement doesn’t carry with it the taste of victory. When, then, do wars end if the leadership will not concede?

Poll shows 71.9% of Taiwanese willing to fight if China attempts to annex 
Taiwan  TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A majority of Taiwanese are willing to defend Taiwan if China uses force against the nation, according to a Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TDF) released on Friday (Dec. 30).

However, if China invades Taiwan to annex it, 71.9% of respondents say they were willing to fight, while 19.3% refused to defend the nation. 
The survey polled adults aged 20 and over in Taiwan, excluding Kinmen and Matsu, and was conducted from May 18-23, 2022. Altogether, 825 and 439 effective samples were completed via telephones and mobile phones, respectively. The maximum sampling error is plus or minus 2.76%.

SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- President Yoon Suk Yeol has said South Korea is in talks with the United States to carry out joint planning and joint exercises involving U.S. nuclear forces to counter North Korea's nuclear threats. 
In an interview with the Chosun Ilbo newspaper published Monday, Yoon said the idea of the U.S. providing a nuclear umbrella or extended deterrence to South Korea is not enough to reassure the South Korean public. 
The interview was published a day after North Korean state media reported leader Kim Jong-un called for "an exponential increase" of his country's nuclear arsenal, while calling South Korea "our undoubted enemy."

A Syrian army statement said the attack came from the Golan Heights and that it downed most of the missiles. 
An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment.
 In a briefing to supporters of his party on Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Israel was taking action "almost weekly" to prevent Iranian entrenchment in Syria.

A 97-year-old former secretary at a Nazi concentration camp has filed an appeal against the guilty verdict she was given for her role in the deaths that took place at her place of work during World War II.
The appeal means that Germany's highest criminal court, the Federal Court of Justice, has to examine whether a procedural error was made.
"The verdict is thus not legally binding," the lower court in Itzehoe in northern Germany said on Wednesday.
Identified only as Irmgard F under German privacy laws, she was found guilty on December 20 of complicity in more than 10,500 cases of murder and given a two-year suspended sentence by a court in northern Germany.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Former pope Benedict, a hero to conservative Catholics and who in 2013 became the first pontiff in 600 years to step down, is "very sick", his successor Pope Francis said on Wednesday, asking Church members to pray for him.
Bishops from Europe, the United States and beyond, urged the faithful to keep Benedict in their thoughts, after the Vatican followed Francis' announcement with a statement saying Benedict had suffered a sudden "worsening" of his health.
"I would like to ask all of you for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who, in silence, is sustaining the Church," Francis said in Wednesday's surprise announcement made at the end of his weekly general audience.

Its promoters reckon it is revolutionizing human experience, but critics stress that the technology risks putting machines in charge of life-changing decisions.
Regulators in Europe and North America are worried.
The European Union is likely to pass legislation next year -- the AI Act -- aimed at reining in the age of the algorithm.
The United States recently published a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and Canada is also mulling legislation.
Looming large in the debates has been China's use of biometric data, facial recognition and other technology to build a powerful system of control.

Uruguay, a country where horses are not considered food but companions, has seen a rise in equine meat exports, prompting efforts to rescue horses destined for slaughter.
In 2020, the small South American nation was the seventh-largest exporter of horse meat, according to the OEC economic data site, with Belgium, Russia, France and Japan among the top importers.
Most of Uruguay's tens of thousands of race, sports and work horses end up on someone's plate somewhere else in the world after they become injured, old, or their owners simply cannot care for them anymore.

Yellow-band disease -- named for the colour it turns corals before destroying them -- was first spotted decades ago and has caused widespread damage to reefs in the Caribbean. There is no known cure.
But it was detected for the first time off Thailand's eastern coast just last year, near the popular tourist city of Pattaya, and has already spread over roughly 600 acres (240 hectares) of the sea.

In early 2022, he joined thousands of Cubans whose migration has amounted to the largest exodus in the Caribbean nation's history.
Gonzalez, a 34-year-old barber, said he could no longer bear the hardships of a country going through its worst economic crisis since the 1990s, or the communist regime he had never embraced.
In Cuba, "you lose hope," he told AFP from Miami, Florida, which he reached after a weeks-long odyssey across multiple countries.
That hopelessness, shared by many young people in Cuba, has pushed emigration to the United States to the highest levels on record.

Instead, 2022 was marked by a new war, record inflation and climate-linked disasters. It was a "polycrisis" year, a term popularized by historian Adam Tooze.
Get ready for more gloom in 2023.
"The number of crises has increased since the start of the century," said Roel Beetsma, professor of macroeconomics at the University of Amsterdam.
"Since World War Two we have never seen such a complicated situation," he told AFP.
After the Covid-induced economic crisis of 2020, consumer prices began to rise in 2021 as countries emerged from lockdowns and other restrictions.
Central bankers insisted that high inflation would only be temporary as economies returned to normal. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's inauguration will be secured by "100 percent" of the capital district's police force, an official said Tuesday amid widespread fears of violence.
Over the weekend, a man was arrested after allegedly placing explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia's airport, hoping to sow "chaos" ahead of the inauguration Sunday.
The suspect was a supporter of Brazil's outgoing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and told authorities he wanted to "prevent the establishment of communism in Brazil" under leftist Lula.
The device did not explode.
On Sunday "there will be a mobilization of 100 percent of the police forces of the Federal District (of Brasilia) to ensure the safety not only of the president, but also of foreign delegations and the public," Lula's future security minister Flavio Dino told reporters.
Lula backers have expressed fear on social media of riots or attacks on inauguration day, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend events in Brasilia.
But Dino sought to give assurances the event will be "safe" and "peaceful," encouraging Brazilians to turn out to celebrate.
He added there had been "no change" to plans for the ceremony, in response to speculation that Lula might do his inauguration parade in a closed car instead of the traditional vintage convertible.
After Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9 percent of the vote in a runoff election in October, supporters of the vanquished president blocked roads and demonstrated outside military barracks demanding the armed forces prevent Lula's inauguration.
On December 12, pro-Bolsonaro demonstrators clashed with the police and set fire to buses and cars in Brasilia.
"Small terrorist and extremist groups will not put the institutions of Brazilian democracy up against a wall," said Dino.
Bolsonaro, who has limited his public appearances after the defeat, has not confirmed that he will follow the tradition of handing over the presidential sash to Lula at Sunday's ceremony.

Russia invades Ukraine and war returns to Europe 
Early in the morning on February 24, the Russian troops that for months have been building up along Ukraine’s northern fringes finally get the go-ahead to cross the border and stage a full-scale invasion. But Russia meets a tougher resistance than expected. And after a failed attempt to take the capital Kyiv, the Russian …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian sausage tycoon Pavel Antov was celebrating his birthday at an India hotel, and was later found dead after apparently falling from an open window, the BBC reports. 
A friend who was with him for the trip died at the hotel two days earlier on Friday. As the BBC points out, Antov's death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov's friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have "consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles."
Antov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. 
From the BBC: "Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov's account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: 'It's extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.' The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a 'patriot of my country' and backed the war."

Kuleba suggested the summit could be mediated by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, a vocal advocate of diplomatic talks to end an invasion that has killed thousands of civilians, devastated Ukraine's infrastructure, and sparked a massive humanitarian crisis.

More commonly known as Thai cranes, the birds nearly disappeared from the country roughly 50 years ago -- they were last spotted in the wild in 1968 -- before a collaboration between the Thai government, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and United Nations to save them.
A breeding program, using fowl donated by Cambodia, began in 1989, with the first reintroduction in 2011.
Sarus cranes are classed by the ICNC as "vulnerable", with an estimated 15,000 remaining in the wild -- with the Thai sub-species having been thought to have disappeared from Thailand's wild wetlands.

Ron DeSantis
Will Donald Trump's former apprentice, popular Florida governor Ron DeSantis, turn on his one-time mentor by challenging him for the Republican nomination for president?
Trump is already gearing up for a potential battle with his MAGA (Make America Great Again) disciple, whose stock has soared among Republicans.
DeSantis won a landslide re-election in November's midterms, in which Trump loyalists fared badly. The property mogul has coined a nickname for the self-styled anti-woke warrior: "Ron de Sanctimonious".

When the world rang in 2022, few would have expected the year to feature the US president speaking of the risk of doomsday, following Russia's threats to go nuclear in its invasion of Ukraine.
"We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis" in 1962, Joe Biden said in October.
And on the year that humanity welcomed its eighth billion member, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the planet was on a "highway to climate hell."

The 100-million-euro ($106,000-million) "Genesis" project hopes to have a product ready by 2030.
Guirec Le Lous, the president of Urgo's medical arm, told AFP that it is a "crazy" project.

Writing before the mid-term election, New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg explained that hundreds of documents he's sifted through, in addition to former Robert Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann's details, revealed enough to show what Putin was after when he worked to swing the 2016 election for Trump.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Monday that the company is now close to having 100 active Starlinks, the firm's satellite internet service, in Iran, three months after he tweeted he would activate the service there amid protests around the Islamic country.
Musk said, "approaching 100 starlinks active in Iran", in a tweet on Monday.
The billionaire had said in September that he would activate Starlink in Iran as part of a U.S.-backed effort "to advance internet freedom and the free flow of information" to Iranians.
The satellite-based broadband service could help Iranians circumvent the government's restrictions on accessing the internet and certain social media platforms amid protests around the country.
The Islamic Republic has been engulfed in protests that erupted after the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody after being arrested by the morality police for wearing "unsuitable attire".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will present his new government to parliament this week, the Knesset speaker said on Monday.
Following his November 1 election win, Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc, with the 73-year-old set to resume his old post as prime minister.
"The vote for the formation of the government will take place at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Thursday in a special session of the Knesset," parliament speaker Yariv Levin said in a statement.
Netanyahu on Wednesday said he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of what analysts call the most right-wing coalition in Israel's history.
While the exact makeup of his cabinet has not yet been released, Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party will govern in partnership with the main ultra-Orthodox parties and members of the extreme bloc that ran under the Religious Zionism alliance.
Leading voices within the new coalition will include Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, tipped to be national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich of Religious Zionism, set to be handed the portfolio responsible for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Both live in Israeli settlements, and Ben Gvir has a long history of using incendiary rhetoric against Arabs.
Netanyahu has also offered a key post to Aryeh Deri, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, although he currently cannot serve in the cabinet due to past convictions for tax offenses.
However, parliament is expected to pass legislation to remove that obstacle, with the second and third readings of a bill due on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption allegations in court, has already served as premier longer than anyone in Israel, including a 1996 to 1999 stint and a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021.
His incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.

China's management of COVID-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A, the health authority said in a statement, as the disease has become less virulent and will gradually evolve into a common respiratory infection.
Three years of zero-tolerance measures, from shuttered borders to frequent lockdowns, have battered China's economy, fuelling last month the mainland's biggest show of public discontent since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
