It reveals the extent of child poverty in these countries and how these cases vary from middle-to-high income countries. Titled <em>Child Poverty in the Midst of Wealth</em>, this report is the latest in the Innocenti Report Card series, which observe children’s well-being in high-income countries. Within these countries, over 69 million children were living in households earning less than 60 percent of the average national income level. Across these countries, there was a reported 8 percent decrease in poverty levels between 2014 to 2021. During this period of relative prosperity, countries took this as an opportunity to address child poverty with varying levels of success.
Of the countries assessed for this report, Slovenia, Poland, Finland and Denmark reported child poverty reduction rates that exceeded 30 percent. By contrast, higher-income countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and France, reported a high percentage of child poverty, and even saw these rates increase in recent years.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/12/12/35558">Read the full story, “The Solutions to Child Poverty Must Reach the Most Vulnerable Communities”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) told reporters that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky faced off against conspiracy theories while meeting members of Congress Tuesday — including one that he used aid from the United States to buy a $75 million yacht. 
The Associated Press reported in September that a conspiracy theory broke out on social media when someone posted a YouTube video claiming "Ukrainian President Zelensky uses proxies to hide ownership of two yachts worth $75,000,000." 
The account hasn't posted any other videos. According to the BBC, the source was "very suspect" and has no other presence anywhere online. 
The company selling the yachts also confirmed to the AP that it wasn't true. 
“We can confirm that the yacht has not been sold and therefore remains for sale," the company's spokesperson, Nicci Perides, told the AP.

But the conspiracy that spread online is now apparently influencing whether or not Republicans will back Zelensky's request for funds necessary to continue fighting off Russia. 
Fox reporter Chad Pergram paraphrased Tillis saying in passing that, "It was helpful that President Zelensky focused on some of the myths around yachts being bought with the money coming from the United States."
Tillis went on to say that he and others are aware of what is happening on the ground in Ukraine and he is confident that the money is being sent properly. He cautioned that if lawmakers failed to support Ukraine, the U.S. would be spending a lot more money if they walked away from them.]]></summary>

The Ukrainian president is facing calls for regime change 
 Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Western public has been sold the story of a Ukrainian front united in its unwavering commitment to a total military victory over Russia. Over the past few weeks, however, this narrative has started to crumble. 
Despite the failure of Ukraine’s Nato-backed counteroffensive, which is now universally accepted, Zelenskyy continues to stick to the maximalist victory-at-all-costs narrative — that Ukraine must go on fighting until it retakes every inch of lost territory, including Crimea, and that Putin should not be negotiated with.

WNU Editor: I personally think his position is secure for the next few months. He has the support of the West, and more importantly, the personal support of President Biden. Replacing him right now will be a military and political disaster for the West, and an admission that their support for Ukraine has failed.

But back in Ukraine all of my friends/contacts/and family members who have always supported Zelensky are now having doubts not only on where the war is going, but on the leadership of Zelensky. 
This is something new, and indicates to me that if the war continues to go as bad as it currently is, support for Zelensky is definitely going to be tested by the spring of 2024. Both inside Ukraine and outside.]]></summary>

— U.S. Navy (@USNavy) December 9, 2023
  
Business Insider: US Navy brags in game-day video a destroyer is 22-0 against the missiles and other threats Iran-backed rebels are throwing around 
* Army may have beaten Navy on Saturday, but the maritime service bragged one of its warships is 22-0 against another challenge. 
* USS Carney, deployed to the Middle East, has been forced to engage threats from Houthi rebels. 
* The Navy shared a video showing the Carney downing missiles and drones launched by the militants. 
The US Naval Academy's football team didn't get a win on Saturday, but thousands of miles away, there's one American warship that's on an impressive hot streak. 
USS Carney is undefeated — by a margin of 22-0 — against the missiles and drones launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels since the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer deployed to Middle Eastern waters in October, according to a video shared to social media by the US Navy during Saturday's Army-Navy football game, which saw the Black Knights defeat the Midshipmen 17-11.

The US military says the missile was launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen as the tanker passed the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. A Houthi spokesman later claimed responsibility for the attack. 
US Central Command said a missile fired from a Yemeni area controlled by Iran-backed Houthi rebels struck a Norwegian-flagged tanker on Monday.

Daily Mail: White House demands more information after Israel 'used US-made white phosphorous during attack on Lebanon that injured nine' 
* Israel has used white phosphorous in attacks on southern Lebanon 
* Rights groups say that on at least one occasion it amounted to a war crime 
* Now an investigation reveals the munitions were supplied by the US 
The White House is concerned about allegations that Israel used white phosphorus supplied by the U.S. during an attack in southern Lebanon, a spokesman said Monday. 
Weapons packed with white phosphorous are not banned under international law but are tightly regulated because of the way they can cause horrific burns. 
An investigation published Monday accused the U.S. of supplying munitions that wounded nine civilians in an attack in October.

Sunak, who became finance minister before the pandemic, provided significant financial support to businesses. Critics have questioned the scheme's contribution to infections, but Sunak stated that it followed safe reopening guidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Business Insider: The huge missile barrage on Ukraine that Russia has been saving up for seems to have begun 
* Analysts have long said Russia was keeping missiles and bombs in reserve for winter. 
* Winter is here — and a Russian barrage has begun right on cue. 
* The UK MOD said Russia's heavy bomber fleet has been active. 
Its target is likely Ukraine's energy network.

Russia appears to have started a major bombing campaign on Ukraine after holding back for months to build its stockpiles. 
The UK Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that a cruise missile attack last Thursday was "probably the start of a more concerted campaign by Russia aimed at degrading Ukraine's energy infrastructure." 
The missiles "were highly likely AS-23a KODIAK," Russia's premier air-launched cruise missile, the MOD said.

"Russia has almost certainly been stockpiling these missiles for use in the winter campaign," it said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Javier Milei: New president tells Argentina 'shock treatment' looms 
Argentina's new far-right president has vowed to deliver economic "shock treatment" in his first speech after formally taking office. 
Javier Milei warned Argentines "there is no money" and recommitted to a programme of harsh austerity measures. 
The populist outsider won a surprise election victory in November with radical pledges to overhaul the South American nation's ailing economy. 
Mr Milei's inauguration was held in Buenos Aires on Sunday.
In a day of pomp and ceremony, the 53-year-old capped his extraordinary rise to power with a speech which left Argentines in no doubt he intends to embark on an economic path unlike any previous president.

        <updated>2023-12-11T17:46:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French lawmakers sent the government’s immigration bill back to the drawing board on Monday, in a surprise move that cut short debates at the lower house and dealt a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to pass laws without a majority.
Lawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far right party as well as many conservatives joined forces to reject the bill on its first day in the National Assembly, adopting a motion proposed by the Greens, which passed by just two votes.
The rejection does not mean the government needs to resign and does not signal the end of the immigration bill.
The government can now decide to send it back to the upper house, send it to a joint committee of senators and deputies to find a compromise, or pull it, which is unlikely.
It can also use special executive powers to force its adoption without a vote.
The immigration bill has been a key plank of Macron’s attempts to show he can be tougher on law and order issues while keeping France’s doors open to foreign workers who can help the French economy.
But short of a majority in parliament, he has struggled to pass a bill that has strict provisions disliked by left-wing lawmakers and more liberal aspects criticised by some conservatives and the far right.
The government has presented the bill as essential to expel foreign criminals more easily. One provision removes a ban on expelling those migrants who arrived in France before the age of 13, as was the case for the alleged Russian-born Islamist militant who killed a French teacher in October.
Other provisions that have been hotly debated are whether non-EU migrants should continue to get access to free medical coverage in France, as well as the government’s aim to facilitate the legalisation of workers in industries suffering from labour shortages such as cafes and restaurants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diamonds in the dust – a ring worth 750,000 euros ($807,000), which went missing at the luxury Ritz hotel in Paris, has been found in a vacuum cleaner.
The ring went missing on Friday and its owner suspected hotel staff of theft.
On Sunday, it was found in a vacuum cleaner bag after police launched an investigation, the Ritz said.
The hotel told AFP the ring had been found “thanks to the meticulous search work carried out by our security guards.”
“Our client is delighted with this news,” the hotel was quoted as saying.
The owner, described as a Malaysian businesswoman, went to the police on Friday after discovering that her ring, left on the table in her room, had disappeared.
On Saturday, she left Paris for London but was expected to return to the French capital to retrieve her ring, Le Parisien newspaper said.
It said the Ritz had offered her three nights’ accommodation as compensation but the businesswoman had no intention of taking advantage of the offer.

Daily Mail:  Chinese-affiliated hacking groups infiltrated critical American infrastructure, including Hawaii water utility and at least one oil and gas pipeline, US officials say 
* More than two dozen high-value targets have been attacked in the last year alone as China seeks to inflict 'societal chaos' in the event of war 
* Beijing is by-passing hi-tech firewalls by targeting ordinary employees 
* It comes as tensions grow over Taiwan, with targets in Hawaii and Guam at the top of the Chinese hit list 
Chinese hackers are positioning themselves inside critical US infrastructure by targeting careless office workers in a bid to cause 'societal chaos' from within should war break out. 
Beijing's military have burrowed into more than 20 major suppliers in the last year alone including a water utility in Hawaii, a major West Coast port and at least one oil and gas pipeline, analysts have revealed. 
They have bypassed elaborate cyber security systems by intercepting passwords and log-ins unguarded by junior employees, leaving China 'sitting on a stockpile of strategic' vulnerabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Hong Kong’s largest self-funded university, Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU), today held an Honorary Degrees Ceremony in which honorary doctorates were conferred on four distinguished recipients. This followed the conclusion of the winter session of its 2023 Congregation last week.  Up-to-date professional degree programmes These new honorary degree-holders have joined a university that next year will be celebrating its 35th anniversary. Although this is young in institutional terms, HKMU has come far in its short span.

Another is Medical Laboratory Science, a sought-after discipline supported by a new 7,000 sq.ft. laboratory that caters to teaching and research across five major medical disciplines. Elsewhere, HKMU has drawn on a HK$73.9 million grant from the Government’s Enhancement and Start-up Grant Scheme for Self-financing Post-secondary Education to launch degree programmes in two other fields of high demand: Construction Management and Quantity Surveying, and New Music and Interactive Entertainment.    All HKMU new programmes are being designed to embrace the latest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. As HKMU President Prof. Paul Lam notes, “For students, AI literacy will be one of the most important skills of the future, and it’s our University’s job to ensure they have it.” Existing programmes are also being “retrofitted” with AI components to realise this vision.  Productive industry partnerships These new programmes are turning out ever-increasing numbers of skilled graduates, and the University…]]></summary>

The Hill: US calls on China to stop ‘dangerous’ actions in South China Sea after Philippine vessel rammed 
The U.S. slammed China for “reckless disregard” and provocative action after Chinese coast guard boats shot water cannons at Philippine ships and collided with a vessel in the South China Sea over the weekend.

Nearly half of voters in a new survey said the United States is spending too much on aid for Ukraine, which comes just ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Washington.

Republicans were more likely to say the U.S. is spending too much, with 65 percent saying so. About half of independent voters and 32 percent of Democrats said the U.S. was spending too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The risk she could lose her children is driving Chiara and her family into self-imposed exile, away from Italy and a hard-right government hostile to same-sex parents.
The 46-year-old is fleeing to Spain after realising her legal rights as one of two mothers of three-year-old Arturo are no longer safe under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
"It's a nightmare," she told AFP, saying she and Christine, 42, are braced to leave friends, family and her job in Rome "because it's the only escape route".
Civil unions became legal in Italy in 2016, but the law on parental rights for same-sex couples is unclear.
Encouraged by several court rulings, local mayors have in recent years been registering both biological and non-biological parents on birth certificates.
But in January, Meloni's interior minist…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders appeared Monday to have persuaded his preferred coalition partners to keep negotiating but reportedly major "stumbling blocks" remain over his hardline anti-Islam, anti-European views.
Wilders delivered a political earthquake in the Netherlands and across Europe last month by handily winning elections and putting his PVV Freedom Party in pole position to form a government.
Unlike Britain and the United States for example, the Netherlands has a hugely fragmented political system that means no one party ever enjoys a parliamentary majority.
Wilders has struggled to convince other party leaders to join his government, as they are put off by elements of his party's manifesto seen as unconstitutional, such as banning mosques and the Koran.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With less than eight months to go before the Paris Olympics, the organisers and the French government are entering an awkward period in which cracks in the preparations are straining relationships.
The main areas of concern are the environmental issues around the surfing venue in Tahiti, the safety of the unprecedented opening ceremony on the Seine, the efficiency of public transport in the Paris region and, of course, the shadow of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- Public transport mess -
The anger and irritation that has shrouded journeys for Paris commuters over the last 18 months has spilled into the political arena.
In mid-November the city's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo declared that the transport system in the city would "not be ready" for the summer of 2024.

Satellites vital for infrastructure, economy, and security are filling up the thousands of miles above the Earth’s surface. With this crowding comes an increase in close approaches between satellites, placing communications, navigation, weather monitoring, missile warning, and other satellites at risk.  There are many reasons to fear close approaches — also known as conjunctions — in space, even if they are accidental. From a safety perspective, accidental satellite collisions could produce thousands of pieces of long-lived debris, as happened when an

WNU Editor: Pepe Escobar in the above post is giving a description of Russia that I am always hearing from my friends/contacts/and family members in Russia. Needless to say the above observations are completely opposite to what the Western media is saying is happening in Russia. 

 
Update: The Duran gives a good analysis in the video below on how Putin was recently treated in his last trip to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.. Putin may be ostracized in the West, but he is more than welcomed in other countries.]]></summary>

President Biden will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House this week, the administration announced Sunday, as Congress looks increasingly unlikely to pass additional funding for Ukraine and as U.S. officials warn that the country will run out of money by the end of the year to fight against Russia’s invasion. 
Zelensky also will meet with some congressional leaders on Tuesday. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) invited Zelensky to speak to senators Tuesday morning, according to a Senate leadership aide. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) will also meet with Zelensky, spokesman Raj Shah said on X, formerly Twitter.

 Sustained Western aid to Ukraine will compel Russia to negotiate on terms favorable to Kyiv by the end of 2024, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Jonathan Finer said on Dec. 8. 
"We want to position Ukraine in such a way by the end of next year that Russia will have to decide whether to come to the negotiating table with conditions acceptable to Ukraine..., or confront a stronger Ukraine," Finer said at the Aspen Security Forum, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine.
Finer believes that a more robust industrial base in the United States and Europe, which will enhance the capabilities of both the U.S. and Ukrainian military industries, will help power a new counteroffensive.

A senior UN aid official has warned that half of Gaza's population is starving, as fighting there continues. 
Carl Skau, deputy director of the UN World Food Programme, said only a fraction of supplies needed have been able to enter the Strip - and nine out of 10 people cannot eat everyday. 
Conditions in Gaza have made deliveries "almost impossible", Mr Skau said.

Israel says it must continue air strikes on Gaza to eliminate Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home.

Civilian proportion of deaths is higher than the average in all world conflicts in 20th century, data suggests 
The aerial bombing campaign by Israel in Gaza is the most indiscriminate in terms of civilian casualties in recent years, a study published by an Israeli newspaper has found. 
The analysis in Haaretz came as Israeli forces fought to consolidate their control of northern Gaza on Saturday, bombing the Shejaiya district of Gaza City, while also conducting airstrikes on Rafah, a town on the southern border with Egypt where the Israeli army has told people in Gaza to take shelter.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
