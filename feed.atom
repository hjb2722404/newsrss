President Biden was at the US Capitol today to give a speech on democracy as he encouraged Americans to vote.

“They too see that democracy is on the ballot this year, and they’re deeply concerned about it. 

“Today, I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, to meet this moment of national and generational importance.

Exit polls show ex-premier Benjamin Netanyahu's party securing the most seats in parliament. 
It's Israel's fifth national election since 2019.  Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing allies secured an early lead in Israel's latest national election, according to exit polls released on Tuesday night after voting closed. 
Exit polls published by Israeli broadcasters showed former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and allied parties close to securing a majority in the 120-seat Knesset.

WNU Editor: Netanyahu is no friend of the Biden White House. He has also vowed to undo the US brokered maritime deal with Lebanon. It looks like there is going to be a lot of friction between the U.S. and Israel.

FOX News: US, Saudi Arabia on high alert over intel of impending Iranian attack: report 
Planned strikes are believed to be targeting Saudi Arabia and Iraq 
The United States and Saudi Arabia are on high alert after Saudi intelligence shared with the U.S. indicated that Iran is expected to carry out an attack on targets in Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
Officials from both countries reportedly told the Journal about the concern over coming attacks. Saudi officials said that in addition to Saudi Arabia, Iran is also looking to strike Erbil, Iraq, where U.S. troops are located. 
The planned attacks are said to be intended as a distraction from protests taking place in Iran against the Islamic nation's leadership.

WNU Editor: I follow Iran very closely. I have seen no uptick in military positioning or movement. I would be shocked if Iran does launch strikes against Saudi Arabia. 
All that I can say is let us pray that such a conflict does not happen. A major war in the Middle East will mean +$200 for a barrel of oil coupled with widespread shortages and rationing. A collapse in supply chains and the global economy. A severe recession, or more likely a severe depression with massive unemployment and social unrest.

Leaked Documents Outline DHS’s Plans to Police Disinformation 
The Department of Homeland Security is quietly broadening its efforts to curb speech it considers dangerous, an investigation by The Intercept has found.

The work, much of which remains unknown to the American public, came into clearer view earlier this year when DHS announced a new “Disinformation Governance Board”: a panel designed to police misinformation (false information spread unintentionally), disinformation (false information spread intentionally), and malinformation (factual information shared, typically out of context, with harmful intent) that allegedly threatens U.S. interests.

Fans of the 45th president begged the new owner to allow him back on the platform, with one user calling Donald Trump’s permanent suspension “the most outrageous act of censorship in modern America”.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prince Harry was slammed by a royal expert as an "emotionally needy" man who has been "completely and utterly taken over" by his wife Meghan Markle.

Tina Brown, author of 'The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor - the Truth and the Turmoil', told The Telegraph ahead of the release of her new book earlier this year that the Duke of Sussex's "whole personality has changed".

"He’s so emotionally needy that he’s been completely and utterly taken over by Meghan and his whole personality has changed. It’s a really sad thing to a great many people," she told the publication.

"Meghan seems to answer some huge need in Harry and it seems like they are in a powerful co-dependency. And I do question how it will end."]]></summary>

This comes amid reports the US Air Force could deploy nuclear-capable bombers to the Northern Territory.

“The relevant US behaviours have increased regional tensions, seriously undermined regional peace and stability and may trigger an arms race in the region,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. 

“China urges the parties concerned to abandon the outdated cold war and … narrow-minded geopolitical thinking.”]]></summary>

Blinken (left) meets with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the margins of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly High Level Week, in New York City. Credit: U.S. State Department photo   
The Diplomat: Blinken, Wang Have First China-US Talks Since 20th Party Congress 
Chinese foreign minister stressed to his U.S. counterpart that Washington should not expect Beijing to change course. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked on the phone on Monday. It was their first conversation — and the first high-level China-U.S. exchange — since the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) concluded on October 22. 
At the party meeting, Wang was elevated to the party’s Politburo. That indicates he is to replace outgoing Yang Jiechi as China’s top diplomat – formally, the director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, the CCP’s foreign policy body. Wang will move out of his foreign minister post along with the promotion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Russia 'suffers deadliest day of invasion yet with nearly a THOUSAND troops killed' as video shows panic-stricken soldiers fleeing on armoured vehicle which flips as it speeds away from Ukrainian attack 
* Ukraine has claimed that 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday as its forces continue to make gains 
* It marks the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin's troops since Russia's the invasion began in back in February 
* Footage has emerged showing panicked soldiers fleeing attack on armoured vehicle - only for it to flip over 
* Comes as Russia tries to round up as many men as possible and push them to the front lines, regardless of skill 
Nearly 1,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in one day in Ukraine, Kyiv has claimed, marking the deadliest day for Vladimir Putin since his troops invaded eight months ago.
Ukrainian forces have been making gains across Russian-occupied areas, with fighting intensifying in the country's east and in the southern city of Kherson. 
 In a blow to Putin's invasion, 950 Russian soldiers were killed on Sunday, pushing the Russian death toll up to at least 71,200, Kyiv has claimed.

WNU editor: If you want to follow war reports from the Ukraine Ministry of Defense, the link is here (link here) 

I personally follow their reports everyday. But needless to say I am skeptical. And in the past few weeks I have found their reports very hard to believe like the claim that 1,000 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday. But they are a reference tool that all those who are following the war should check out each day. 
As for those who want to follow the Russian Ministry of Defense website. It is unfortunately blocked for outsiders. This may change in the future, so the link is here https://eng.mil.ru/]]></summary>

   DW: Norway raises army alert level in response to Ukraine war 
The Norwegian armed forces will do less training and more active operations, the country's prime minister said. Oslo is concerned about sabotage to its energy infrastructure. 
Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Monday that his country's military would be put on a raised level of alert as part of increased security measures in response to the war in Ukraine. 
"This is the most severe security situation in several decades," Stoere told a press conference  "
There are no indications that Russia is expanding its warfare to other countries, but the increased tensions make us more exposed to threats, intelligence operations and influence campaigns." 
The increased alert level would be valid from Tuesday.

Officials in Chinese cities and provinces across the country are pulling no punches in stamping out sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks as winter nears, quickly closing venues and enforcing longer temporary lockdowns on millions of people. 
Cases in mainland China hit 2,898 on Sunday, topping 2,000 for a second straight day and pressuring the country’s controversial zero-COVID policy, which has hamstrung the economy and exasperated its citizens.

Insider: Chinese leader Xi Jinping's power grab fueled a $6 trillion stock selloff and the yuan's decline. These 4 charts capture the market meltdown 
* China's President Xi Jinping has tightened his grip on power — and that has rocked markets. 
* Investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout as Xi shut reformers out of decision making. 
* These 4 charts show how deep the meltdown in China-linked assets went last week. 
China's leader Xi Jinping has tightened his grip on power, shutting out reformers to effectively take sole charge of the world's second-largest economy — and that has rocked markets. 
President Xi unveiled a new decision-making team stacked with like-minded political allies and publicly disrespected his business-friendly predecessor at the Communist Party congress last week. 
Spooked investors dumped Chinese stocks in a $6 trillion blowout Monday, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, the tightly-managed onshore yuan continued to lose ground to the dollar, having already dropped sharply this year.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and the European Union are examining whether to classify Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Sunday. 
"I made it clear last week that we will launch another package of sanctions, that we will examine how we can also list the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation," Baerbock said in a interview with ARD broadcaster on Sunday. 
Her comments come after the head of the Revolutionary Guards warned protesters that Saturday would be their last day of taking to the streets, in a sign that security forces may intensify their already fierce crackdown on widespread unrest.

Competition, miscalculations, and regulatory scrutiny have all but killed the advertising giant's dreams of diversifying its business and rolling up the digital world into its platform. 
For years, the definition of success for many tech employees has been getting a job at a FAANG company (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). 
Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, meanwhile, are often the five major companies people think of when they think of "big tech." 
But there is evidence that Facebook—once a dominant monopoly rightly blamed for all sorts of societal ills—is on the precipice of dropping out of this group through years of sheer mismanagement, a failure to innovate, setting money on fire in pursuit of a metaverse that seemingly no one wants, a vulnerable business model that Apple is squarely taking aim at, and upstart competitors like TikTok that the company seemingly has no answer for. What seemed impossible just a year or two ago—that Facebook will become just another tech company, more or less—now seems like a very real possibility.

WNU Editor: It has been quite a sight to see how quickly this social media platform has lost its influence and reach in the past year. And much of what has happened has been self-inflicted. 
And while I do believe Facebook will be with us for the foreseeable future. Alternative media platforms are now online, and they are providing an environment that does not have the censorship and privacy issues that Facebook has.]]></summary>

* Truss was told Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea 
* Radiation could pose threat to Europe if weapon blew in the direction 
* Ms Truss became fixated with the weather after hearing about possibility 
When Liz Truss was told, during the dying days of her mayfly Premiership, that the security services were picking up intelligence that Vladimir Putin might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine it sent a chill down her spine. 
The Prime Minister was still adjusting to getting used to a new mobile phone number, for the first time in over a decade, as a result of a hack suspected to have been backed or orchestrated by the Kremlin, potentially giving Putin access to information about Western support for President Volodymyr Zelensky's regime. 
 In particular, Ms Truss was told that Putin might explode a weapon in the air above the Black Sea, which would show the West what he was capable of without triggering a full-scale nuclear war.

DNYUZ/Newsweek: Putin Should Be Overthrown, Majority of Americans Say: Poll

On February 24 Putin ordered his army into Ukraine, triggering one of the biggest wars in Europe since the end of World War II. 
After the Russians initially made significant gains, Ukraine has recaptured some territory over the past couple of months, particularly around the northern city of Kharkiv and Kherson in the south. 
According to the Redfield and Wilton poll, conducted for Newsweek, 60 percent of U.S. voters think seeking to “remove Vladimir Putin from power would be a reasonable objective.”

Republicans 47% (+2)

   CBS News: Republicans head into final week with lead in seats, voters feel things are "out of control" — CBS News Battleground Tracker poll 
The election is already underway; millions have voted, and tens of millions more will before Nov. 8. Amid that, eight in 10 likely voters describe things in the country today as "out of control," as opposed to "under control." 
That doesn't bode well for the party in power: Republicans are winning those who say "out of control" right now by more than 20 points, though they're often the ones feeling that way to begin with.   So where do things stand?   
Read more ....   
Update #1: The US Senate races appear to be close .... Its a dead heat for the US Senate (FiveThirtyEight).  
Update #2: It looks like some Governor-ships are flipping Republican .... Governor’s Races Enter Final Sprint on a Scrambled, Surprising Map (New York Times).   
WNU Editor: The CBS/YouGov poll does not say how much of their sample size is Democrat/Republican/Independent. 
FiveThirtyEight says it is a dead heat, but when you look at their map projections it looks like the Republicans are going to pick up a minimum of two seats. 
The New York Times assessment on the governor-ships is blunt. A number of Republican pick-ups.
Bottom line. It is going to be a good night if you are a Republican.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this photo released by the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen watches soldiers operate equipment during a visit to a naval station on Penghu, an archipelago of several dozen islands off Taiwan's western coast on Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2022. (Taiwan Ministry of National Defense via AP)   
StraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons 
Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. 
Defending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. 
Preventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.

WNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.

The same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.]]></summary>
