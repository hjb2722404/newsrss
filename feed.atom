   Endgadget: Frontline Ukraine troops are reportedly enduring Starlink outages  
The lack of internet access is said to be hampering efforts to drive back Russian forces. 
Ukrainian forces have reportedly been dealing with Starlink outages as they try to take back Russian-occupied areas. 
Some of the outages, which are said to have caused a severe loss of communication over the last several weeks, occurred as troops broke through the frontline into territory controlled by Russia as well as during battles, a Ukraine government official told The Financial Times. 
The cause of the apparent outages are not yet known. Engadget has contacted Starlink owner SpaceX for comment. 
Starlink outages were reported in the four regions that Russia annexed last month following referendums, the legitimacy of which have been disputed. 
As the Financial Times notes, there's a significant Ukrainian counteroffensive in those areas.

Daily Mail: From bare-chested brute to Bond-villain wannabe: The images that show Vladimir Putin's unpredictable nature across 70 years... as the Russian leader takes the world to the brink of Armageddon 
* Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70 on Friday amid his on-going invasion of neighbouring Ukraine 
* Putin has dominated Russia for nearly 23 years since being picked by President Boris Yeltsin as his successor 
* He cultivated an image at home as a strongman with adventure stunts, such as riding, fishing and shooting 
* But despite trying to show off his fun side, he has also dragged Russia back into isolation, and has grown increasingly occupied with his legacy. 
Many fear he could resort to using nuclear weapons to secure it  Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70 on today amid his on-going invasion of Ukraine and mounting speculation around the health of the longest-serving paramount leader of Russia since Josef Stalin. 
The Russian despot has dominated Russia for nearly 23 years since being handpicked by President Boris Yeltsin as his preferred successor in a surprise announcement on New Year's Eve 1999. 
 Since then, Putin has been either President or Prime Minister of Russia. He has met with all manner of world leaders, and has carefully curated his image as a strongman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Marines storm a beach near disputed reef in South China Sea as part of wargames featuring thousands of soldiers from US, Philippines and South Korea after Beijing's military drills around Taiwan 
* The KAMANDAG exercises between US and Philippines kicked off Monday and will go on until October 14 
* Marines from both nations and South Korea stormed beach close to a disputed area in South China Sea today 
* The drills were held just 150 miles off Scarborough Shoal, a territory seized by China in 2012 from Philippines 
* The exercises aimed to improve Philippine military's coastal defence capability and invasion readiness 
* It comes after China held a series of huge war games off coast of Taiwan which raised alarm bells 
US and Philippine marines stormed a beach near a disputed rocky outcrop in the South China Sea on Friday as part of joint military drills involving more than 3,500 troops. 
The KAMANDAG exercises - the Philippines' acronym for 'Cooperation of the Warriors of the Sea' - kicked off Monday and will be held across the country's main island of Luzon until October 14. 
Around 300 troops were involved in Friday's amphibious drills held on an uninhabited beach in Zambales province, about 150 miles east of Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012.

Jailed campaigner Ales Bialiatski, Memorial and Center for Civil Liberties win award that will be seen as condemnation of Putin 
The jailed Belarusian human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the Russian human rights organisation Memorial and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties have won the 2022 Nobel peace prize, in an award the committee said was to honour champions of “peaceful coexistence” during the most tumultuous period in Europe since the second world war.
“The peace prize laureates represent civil society in their home countries,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee. “They have for many years promoted the right to criticise power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens.”

The blockade of Haiti’s main fuel terminal by a federation of gangs has made it nearly impossible for millions of Haitians to obtain fuel and increasingly difficult to find drinking water or food.   
The big picture: Three-quarters of Haiti’s hospitals have closed due to “the fuel crisis, insecurity and looting,” the UN says, just as cholera is beginning to spread around the country.
* Gang leaders and protesters are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, backed by demonstrations that have at times turned violent.   
Driving the news: Henry appealed last night for international assistance, though he didn't specifically request a military intervention.

PARIS (Reuters) - France launched a national energy savings plan on Thursday, banking on a push to turn off lights and lower thermostats to avoid power and gas cuts over the winter. 
Although the country is less dependent on Russian gas than eastern neighbours like Germany, French nuclear power production has slumped as the sector struggles to bring more of its aging reactors online out of forced maintenance. 
The government has set a target of cutting France's energy consumption 10% by 2024 from 2019 levels, a first step in a longer-term plan to become carbon neutral by reducing energy use 40% by 2050.
"Our joint action will allow us to avoid taking more binding measures," Energy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said as she presented the plan.

Britain braces for potential energy blackouts this winter amid supply disruptions due to the war in Ukraine 
The U.K. national power operator has warned that citizens should brace for up to three-hour power blackouts this winter in the "unlikely" event that gas supplies fall short. 
The National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) announced Thursday that it has taken steps to establish precautionary measures to ensure gas supplies from October 31 to March 31, 2023. 
"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that overall, this is likely to be a challenging winter for energy supply throughout Europe," the national operator said in a statement that highlighted multiple scenarios where Brits could find their power shut off during peak use.

CNN: Hiking rates too quickly could trigger a ‘prolonged recession,’ IMF head warns 
The global economic outlook is darkening and the risks of recession are quickly rising: That’s the latest message from the International Monetary Fund, which said Thursday it will once again lower its growth projections. 
“We estimate that countries accounting for about one-third of the world economy will experience at least two consecutive quarters of contraction this or next year,” said IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva during a speech at Georgetown University. 
“And, even when growth is positive, it will feel like a recession because of shrinking real incomes and rising prices.”  The IMF anticipates that the world could lose $4 trillion in economic output between now and 2026.

* The US Government makes its first purchase of Nplate for 'nuclear emergencies' 
* The drug treats radiation sickness by stopping life-threatening bleeding 
* Putin's nuclear warning did not spur the purchase, the Government said 
The US has stocked up on radiation sickness drugs just weeks after Vladimir Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons against the West. 
Officials said the deal — worth $290million — was ‘part of ongoing work’ and ‘has not been accelerated’ by the Kremlin leader's escalating rhetoric. 
The US Health and Human Services (HHS) - whose motto is to 'improve the health, safety, and well-being of America - announced the purchase of romiplostim Tuesday.

        <updated>2022-10-07T00:00:00.020Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Kremlin seizes on Zelensky 'blunder' after Ukraine President demands NATO 'launch pre-emptive strikes' on Russia to stop Putin using nukes - before insisting he meant 'imposing sanctions' pre-invasion as Kyiv troops hammer Moscow forces into retreat 
* Zelensky appeared to suggest NATO should launch a series of preemptive strikes against Russian territory 
* Russia said the comments risked 'monstrous consequences' and appeared to call for 'yet another world war' 
* Kyiv later insisted Zelensky was referencing preemptive sanctions and 'would never call for use of nukes' 
The Kremlin has warned of potentially 'monstrous consequences' after Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to suggest NATO powers should bomb Russia to deter Vladimir Putin from using nuclear weapons against Ukraine. 
Russia said such comments risked starting 'yet another world war' after the Ukrainian president seemed to tell Australian think tank the Lowy Institute that he believed 'preemptive strikes' on Russian territory were necessary. 
However Kyiv later insisted he was actually calling for 'preemptive sanctions', just as he did 'before February 24', when the invasion was launched.

WNU Editor: These remarks are insane. This is how World War 3 will start.  The Ukraine government is walking back President Zelensky's remarks on a pre-emptive strike. But he was very clear on what he said and what he wants. 
The complete remarks by Ukraine President Zelensky at the Lowy institute is below:

The Hill: House Democrats propose end to US troop protection in Gulf after OPEC cut 
Three House Democrats have introduced legislation to end U.S. troop protection in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in response to news this week that OPEC and its allies will slash oil production. 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which together comprise about 30 percent of global crude oil reserves, have some 5,000 U.S. troops stationed there. 
In addition to removing those troops and American missile defense systems from the two countries, the legislation introduced by Reps. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Susan Wild (D-Pa.) would move all U.S. technology and defense systems elsewhere in the region.

Quartz: OPEC’s oil cuts force the US to reconsider its foreign policy  
The US is accusing Saudi Arabia of "aligning with Russia" while seeking to restart Venezuelan oil production. 
OPEC+ announced it’ll slash output by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) on Wednesday (Oct. 5), the biggest cut since the pandemic started in 2020. The White House’s reaction was swift, calling the decision “shortsighted” and accusing the oil cartel of “aligning with Russia.” 
Saudi Arabia, which controls about one-third of OPEC’s oil reserves and is seen as a US ally, has not heeded president Joe Biden’s plea against taking such a drastic step. 
Three months ago, Biden traveled to the Middle Eastern nation to convince the kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, to pump more barrels.

Oil production cuts prompt backlash from Washington amid soaring energy inflation 
The White House has accused Opec+ of aligning with Russia after Saudi Arabia led the group in agreeing deep oil production cuts, prompting a backlash from countries battling surging energy inflation triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The Opec+ group said it would reduce production targets by 2mn barrels a day, equivalent to 2 per cent of global supply, following its first in-person meeting in two years in Vienna. The actual cut in output is likely to be closer to 1mn b/d as many weaker members have struggled to hit production targets in recent months.

WNU Editor: OPEC is seeing western countries impose oil sanctions, oil price caps, and hearing vows to transition away from fossil fuels. What also does not help is the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, an attack that many in OPEC see (rightly or wrongly) was done by the U.S. on a fellow energy producing state. Of course OPEC is going to circle the wagons and react in the way that they did. They see their economic survival at stake.]]></summary>

Washington Examiner: Biden says it 'remains to be seen' whether he'll meet Putin at G-20 summit 
President Joe Biden has not completely discounted the prospect of a meeting between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 summit next month in Indonesia. 
“That remains to be seen," Biden told reporters Thursday on the White House's South Lawn. 
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre earlier declined to confirm a separate meeting between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also expected to attend the summit in Bali from Nov. 15-16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Taiwan Will Treat China Flights Into Airspace as 'First Strike' 
(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan warned it would treat any Chinese incursion into the island’s airspace as a “first strike,” as Taipei seeks to deter Beijing from ratcheting up military pressure around the island. 
Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told lawmakers in Taipei that the ministry was taking such incursions more seriously after a recent spate of closer flights by Chinese warplanes and drones.
Pressed on whether any warplane’s violation of Taiwan’s airspace would be viewed as a first strike, Chiu said, “Yes,” without elaborating what the response would be. 
“In the past, we said we won’t be the first to strike, which meant we won’t do it without them firing artillery shells or missiles, et cetera, first,” Chiu said Wednesday. 
“But now the definition has obviously changed, as China used means like drones. So we have adjusted, and will view any crossing of aircraft or vessels as a first strike.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DNYUZ/New York Times: U.S. Aims to Turn Taiwan Into Giant Weapons Depot 
WASHINGTON — American officials are intensifying efforts to build a giant stockpile of weapons in Taiwan after studying recent naval and air force exercises by the Chinese military around the island, according to current and former officials. 
The exercises showed that China would probably blockade the island as a prelude to any attempted invasion, and Taiwan would have to hold out on its own until the United States or other nations intervened, if they decided to do that, the current and former officials say. 
But the effort to transform Taiwan into a weapons depot faces challenges. The United States and its allies have prioritized sending weapons to Ukraine, which is reducing those countries’ stockpiles, and arms makers are reluctant to open new production lines without a steady stream of long-term orders.

RT: Russia ready to send gas to EU via Nord Stream 2 — Moscow 
Supplies are possible through the undamaged string of the pipeline, according to Russia’s deputy prime minister   Russia is able to supply gas to Europe through a string of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that that was not damaged by the recent explosions, according to Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Novak. 
The energy official described the blasts on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines as deliberate.  “Unfortunately, due to sabotage, one string [of Nord Stream 2] was damaged, and an examination is required to make further decisions on the fate of the string,” Novak was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti news agency. 
“As for the second string, it is ready, fully built, and if the necessary legal decisions are made by our European colleagues regarding the certification and removal of restrictions, I think Russia could provide appropriate supplies through this string of the gas pipeline in a short time,” he said.

Update: Russia ready to supply gas to EU over undamaged Nord Stream 2 string — Deputy PM (TASS).   
WNU Editor: I was stunned when I heard this news. Is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline actually two pipelines? Are there redundancies that we do not know about? 
I will be updating this news when more information becomes available, because I am confident that by the end of the day many governments/news organizations/and interest groups will want a clarification from the Russian government. 
But if this is true, it looks like those who are tried to sabotage the pipelines did so with incomplete information.]]></summary>

According to Maria Zakharova, someday the EU countries will have to admit that they were betrayed by their allies 
MOSCOW, October 5. /TASS/. The EU countries will have to face the truth and admit that they were betrayed by their allies in the situation involving the Nord Stream incidents, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel on Wednesday. 
She drew attention to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak’s statement that Russia was ready to supply gas through the undamaged Nord Stream 2 pipeline string.   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The above weekly Russian Foreign Ministry briefing begins at 1:07:35.. English translation available.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova's remarks reminds me of what a very good friend of mine told me once. People never learn until it hits their pocket-books. 
For Russia, these pipelines represent years of planning and work, $23 billion to build, and the expectation of almost a trillion dollars in revenues to Russia over the lifetime of this pipeline that is now lost forever. 
For Europe the loss and cost is even greater. Energy shortages. The astronomical cost to replace this energy. Economic dislocation/dis-industrialization. High inflation and a debt explosion that will cripple the budgets of governments/businesses/families. A social cost that is currently incalculable. 
Bottom line. 
This attack is easily going to cost Europe hundreds of billions of dollars, if not a trillion. 
So yes. The state actor(s) that did this, and the entire world outside of Canada and the U.S. know who that is, has betrayed the EU.]]></summary>

    Washington Examiner: WATCH: Biden drops F-bomb while touring Hurricane Ian devastation in Florida 
President Joe Biden dropped an F-bomb in a hot mic moment during a visit to hurricane-ravaged Florida on Wednesday. 
The candid moment came as Biden exchanged words with Fort Myers Beach Mayor Ray Murphy, who had just thanked the president for coming to the state. 
The two men were shaking hands, and Biden began to say something that was not quite clear in the audio. Several Twitter sleuths suggested he said, "No one f***s with a Biden," although the last word in particular was muffled.

   WNU Editor: For China and in particular Xi watchers this is a must read. I was in Fujian during the time when Xi was a party chief in one of this provinces regions, and during that time the talk in the universities was on the need to replicate the anti-communist movements in eastern Europe. Leading this discussion were those in the arts/culture/music/etc. (just like in eastern Europe at the same time). Hollywood is not the only cultural institution in the world that has a profound influence on it social and political culture. This is actually the case for must countries, and Xi obviously learned that lesson at a very young age when he saw what what was happening around him during that time. On a side note. Chinese President Xi's wife is a singer and musician.]]></summary>

The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, officials said.

The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic, as moving nuclear warheads closer to Russia would make them more vulnerable and less militarily useful, according to experts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.
Lead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.
Gahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.
"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil," he said of their 19th tour.
The band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words "Berlin 4.10.22".
Credited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, "Spirit", in 2017. "Memento Mori" will be their 15th studio record.
Depeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.
The band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as "Personal Jesus", "People Are People" and "Enjoy the Silence".
The group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.

Polish demands for trillions in World War II reparations for damages are a non-starter, said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock during a visit to Warsaw on Tuesday.
The question of reparations is closed, as far as the German government is concerned, the Green Party politician said on Tuesday, following consultations with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau.
Still, "Germany stands by its historical responsibility without any ifs and buts," Baerbock said. "It remains our eternal task to remember the millionfold suffering German inflicted on Poland."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The biggest software upgrade in the short history of crypto has fulfilled its promise to wipe out more than 99 percent of the electricity used by the second-biggest cryptocurrency, experts have told AFP.
That is no mean feat, given that the Ethereum blockchain was burning through about as much electricity as New Zealand.
Sceptics had expected glitches with the upgrade, known as "the merge", but it ended up being a "rather boring event", according to Alex de Vries of the Free University in Amsterdam.
De Vries, whose Digiconomist website models the energy use of Bitcoin and Ethereum, said consumption had indeed plummeted by more than 99 percent on Ethereum.
Moritz Platt, a researcher specializing in crypto at King's College London, said the 99 percent estimates were realistic and heralded a …]]></summary>

Now, 10 years into President Xi Jinping's rule, community organizations such as Charles's have been dismantled and hopes of a rebirth crushed.
Charles has fled China and several of his activist friends are in jail.
"After 2015, the whole of civil society began to collapse and become fragmented," he told AFP, using a pseudonym for safety reasons.
Xi, on the brink of securing a third term at the apex of the world's most populous country, has overseen a decade in which civil society movements, an emergent independent media and academic freedoms have been all but destroyed.

Many of Australia's species are clinging to existence, their habitats shrinking from human activity and extreme events such as the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires, wildlife groups say.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government announced a new 10-year scheme to try and halt the slide into extinction of 110 "priority species" and shield 20 "priority places" from further degradation.
It aims to prevent any new extinctions of plants and animals while conserving at least 30 percent of Australia's land mass.
Wildlife groups blame Australia's poor record in protecting its unique species largely on habitat destruction, accelerated by glob…]]></summary>

"The deserts and mountains of Saudi Arabia will soon be a playground for winter sports," the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said in a statement on the decision made during its general assembly meeting in Phnom Penh.
The Saudi bid was "unanimously approved", the statement said, noting that the megacity known as NEOM will be the first West Asian city to host the event.
First announced in 2017, NEOM has consistently raised eyebrows for proposed flourishes like flying taxis and robot maids, even as architects and economists have questioned its feasibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for "experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science", the award-giving body said on Tuesday.
The more than century-old prize, worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($902,315), is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week after Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the prize for Physiology or Medicine on Monday.
The prestigious prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in the will of Alfred Nobel, who made a fortune from his invention of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 with a some interruptions, primarily the two world wars.
The physics prize has often taken centre stage among the awards, featuring household names of science such as Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie, and rewarding breakthroughs that have reshaped how we see the world.
Last year, scientists Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi shared the physics prize for their work on
complex physical systems such as Earth's changing climate, key in understanding global warming.
Announced over consecutive weekdays in early October, the physics prize announcement will be followed by awards for chemistry, literature, peace and economics, the latter added in 1969 to the original line-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nuclear-armed North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years on Tuesday, prompting a warning for residents to take cover and a temporary suspension of train operations in northern Japan.
The Japanese government warned citizens to take cover as the missile appeared to have flown over and past its territory before falling into the Pacific Ocean.
It was the first North Korean missile to follow such a trajectory since 2017, and Tokyo said its 4,600 km (2,850 miles) range may have been the longest distance travelled for a North Korean test flight, which are more often "lofted" higher into space to avoid flying over neighboring countries.
The latest launch was Pyongyang's fifth in 10 days, amid military muscle-flexing by the United States, South Korea, and Japa…]]></summary>

The agency that manages Ecuador's prisons, SNAI, gave the death toll in a statement which also said 21 people were injured in the clashes between inmates.
It had earlier announced that tactical units conducted operations to regain control of the facility, located in the Ecuadoran city of Latacunga.
The prison houses about 4,300 prisoners and is one of the largest in the country.
Violence in Ecuador's prisons, where drug gangs vie for power, is often carried out with knives and sometimes involves beheadings. The violence has left more than 400 prisoners dead since February 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurricane Orlene made landfall on Monday on Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and a risk of flooding and landslides, forecasters said.
Orlene came ashore south of the beachside city of Mazatlan in Sinaloa state as a Category One hurricane -- the weakest on a scale of five.
At 1500 GMT, the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour and moving inland toward the northeast, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
Boats had been brought ashore in Mazatlan ahead of Orlene's arrival, and businesses boarded up windows and laid down sandbags in case of flooding.
Orlene had strengthened to a powerful Category 4 hurricane on Sunday in the Pacific, prompting warnings for inhabitants of at-risk areas to take refuge in temporary shelters.
But the storm gradually lost strength as it approached the coast and was expected to quickly lose its hurricane force after making landfall.
"Rapid weakening is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours as Orlene moves inland," the NHC said.
"Orlene is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm by this afternoon, and dissipate tonight or early Tuesday," it added.
Tropical cyclones hit Mexico every year on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts, usually between May and November.
In October 1997, Hurricane Paulina hit Mexico's Pacific coast as a Category 4 storm, leaving more than 200 dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain on Monday scrapped plans to axe its top income tax rate just 10 days after a debt-driven budget sparked turmoil on markets and fierce criticism during a cost-of-living crisis.
On the second day of the ruling Conservative Party's annual conference, finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted he was "not proceeding" with the removal of the top 45-percent income tax rate, adding it had become a "distraction".
The announcement also marked the first major policy U-turn under British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who took office less than one month ago.
"It is clear that the abolition of the 45p tax rate has become a distraction from our overriding mission to tackle the challenges facing our country. As a result, I'm announcing we are not proceeding with the abolition of the ... rate.
"We get it, and we have listened."
The announcement also came after former cabinet ministers Grant Shapps and Michael Gove voiced opposition over unfunded tax cuts unveiled by Kwarteng in his controversial mini-budget on September 23.
Kwarteng had proposed to remove the 45-percent rate applied to Britons earning more than £150,000 ($167,400) per year.
The so-called mini budget had sent the pound plunging to a record dollar low and sent bond yields spiking on fears of a borrowing splurge.
The budget included a costly freeze on energy bills for individuals and businesses, in an attempt to cushion fallout from key gas producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Brazil’s presidential race will need to go to an October 30th second round after former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fell short of the 50%+1 he needed to avoid a run-off with extremist incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.
Brazilians voted Sunday in a historic presidential election, with leftist front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who led in the pre-election polls, winning but still short of the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff election.

There are fears the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro will not accept a defeat after he warned that he will only leave office if he's "killed, jailed, or victorious" and has called on his base to "go to war" if the vote is "stolen."
Bolsonaro took an early lead as results started coming in but in 2014, when Lula's leftist party last won a presidential election, it only took the lead after two hours of vote counting. Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.
Lula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.

With 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:

With 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:


Lula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.
To win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.
Polls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.

STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) -Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for discoveries that underpin our understanding of how modern day humans evolved from extinct ancestors.
The prize, arguably among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute and is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($900,357).
It is the first of this year's batch of prizes. The Award committee officially gave Paabo the prize for "discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution."

Outrage over her death has sparked the biggest wave of protests to rock the Islamic republic in almost three years, as well as global solidarity rallies that saw people take to the streets in more than 150 cities at the weekend, with many symbolically cutting off their hair.

"We're committed to helping Taiwan develop the capability to defend itself," Austin said in an interview with CNN.
Washington has historically maintained a policy of "strategic ambiguity" on whether it would intervene militarily if Taiwan were attacked by China.
Asked in an interview with CBS last month whether US troops would defend Taiwan, Biden said "yes," if it were "an unprecedented attack."
Austin was asked by CNN host Fareed Zakaria whether the US military was preparing to send troops to Taiwan in line with Biden's comments, but he declined to answer directly.
