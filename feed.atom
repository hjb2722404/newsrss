        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Mann covers the U-S opioid and fentanyl crisis for NPR. That means he talks to a lot of people struggling with addiction. Again and again, he's heard stories of people who have succumbed to their addiction — last year 112, 000 — more than ever in history.   
But when Mann traveled to Portugal to report on that country's model for dealing with the opioid crisis, he heard a very different story. Overdose deaths in Portugal are extremely rare.
The country has taken a radically different approach to drugs – decriminalizing small amounts and publicly funding addiction services – including sites where people can use drugs like crack and heroin. 
Portugal treats addiction as an illness rather than a crime. No one has to pay for addiction care, and no one scrambles to navigate a poorly regulated recovery system. Could Portugal's approach help the U-S fight its opioid epidemic?

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/chile-to-reopen-probe-into-mystery-of-poet-pablo-neruda/"/>
        <updated>2024-02-20T17:22:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chile will once again try to resolve the mystery of what really killed the Nobel laureate poet Pablo Neruda, who many believe was poisoned by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a court said Tuesday.
The appeals court ordered the reopening of the investigation into the death of Neruda, who was a prominent member of Chile's Communist Party when military dictator Augusto Pinochet took power in 1973.
In a statement, the court said that the "investigation has not been exhausted as there are precise procedures that can be carried out to clarify the facts."
Neruda had been preparing to flee into exile in Mexico to lead the resistance against the Pinochet regime when he died in hospital just 12 days after the coup.
The government claimed the 69-year-old had died of prostate cancer.
An investigation into the cause of Neruda's death began in 2011 when Manuel Araya -- his driver and personal assistant -- asserted that the poet was given a mysterious injection in his chest just before he died.
Araya died in June last year, aged 77.
In 2017, a group of Chilean and international experts concluded that Neruda did not die of cancer, but said they could not determine what did kill him.
And in 2023, a scientific panel investigating Neruda's death was also unable to determine whether he had been poisoned, even though they detected dangerous botulism-causing bacteria in his system.
Judge Paola Plaza ordered the probe to be closed in December 2023, but Neruda's family and the Communist Party appealed that decision soon after.
Neruda is remembered especially for sensual poems about love.
However, in recent years his romantic image has been tainted after his admission in his posthumous memoirs that he had raped a woman came to light after the emergence of the #MeToo movement.
Pinochet, who ruled Chile for 17 years, oversaw a regime that killed some 3,200 leftist activists and other suspected opponents.
The dictator died in 2006 aged 91 without ever being convicted for crimes committed by his regime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Forward-looking family businesses have demonstrated remarkable resilience around the world, empowering them to weather market volatility and commercial shifts. These enterprises have not merely survived but thrived.  A common trait among these businesses is the founders’ foresight for strategic, long-term planning. This includes diversifying revenue streams and segregating business operations to facilitate efficient succession by future generations.   Such planning allows subsequent generations to maintain the founders’ core values and continue their legacy.

Diversification involves expanding operations into various areas to broaden income sources, tap into high-growth potential, and reduce reliance on the original industries, thereby mitigating the risk associated with a single or limited revenue stream.   Resilience is another common trait among successful family enterprises, often fostered through business modernisation. To stay competitive and relevant, they adapt to new trends and opportunities, which may involve diversifying products, penetrating new…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-02-20T13:12:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter on Tuesday suspended the account of Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.
According to Sky News, it is not clear why Navalnaya's account was suspended, and her latest posts were demands to the Russian government to return her late husband's body.
The account was suspended for roughly an hour, though as of this writing, it appears to be back online.
Twitter CEO Elon Musk has a long history of attacking American foreign policy when it comes to aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia, although it's not known at this point if Musk had any role in the decision to suspend Navanaya's account.
The death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has further diminished a rapidly shrinking Russian opposition, which has seen its members assassinated, sentenced to lengthy prison terms or forced into exile as Russian President Vladimir Putin makes it clear he will not tolerate challenges to his regime.
It was widely feared that Alexei Navalny was risking his life by positioning himself as Putin’s most vocal critic in an increasingly repressive Russia, even challenging him for the presidency in 2018.
Navalny narrowly survived being poisoned with novichok – a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union – in 2020 and spent months recuperating in Germany. He earned admiration from Russia's disparate opposition for voluntarily returning to Russia the following year.
His death comes just a day before the official launch of campaigning ahead of a new round of presidential elections set for March 15-17.
Putin oversaw changes to the constitution in 2021 that will allow him to run for two more six-year terms, meaning he could stay in power until 2036. Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.
On December 8 Putin announced his candidature for re-election and is widely expected to win, given the lack of political alternatives and the Kremlin's iron grip on the state apparatus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez was extradited to the United States Thursday to stand trial for allegedly aiding the smuggling of hundreds of tons of cocaine to America and receiving millions of dollars in bribes.
The 53-year-old, whose 2014 to 2022 stint as president was plagued by allegations of corruption, risks spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
AFP witnessed Hernandez’s departure from an air force base in Tegucigalpa on a Drug Enforcement Administration plane destined for the United States. He is due to appear in a New York court on Friday.
Hernandez is accused of having facilitated the smuggling of some 500 tons of cocaine – mainly from Colombia and Venezuela – to the United States via Honduras since 2004, starting long before his presidency.

Nelson Carlo de los Santos Arias, who made "Pepe", one of the buzziest titles at this week's Berlinale festival, said filming the animals on location in Namibia and Colombia had been dicey for his crew.
"One time we didn't know there were hippos there and then they almost took the boat that we were in and so we almost lost the camera," the Dominican filmmaker told AFP.
"Another time a mother -- they are the most aggressive ones -- started running and the sound guy almost lost his equipment."
De los Santos Arias noted the animals can run "up to 35 kilometres (22 miles) per hour, these five tonnes of fat".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia's FSB security services said on Tuesday it had arrested a US-Russian woman suspected of treason for raising funds for the Ukrainian army.
The FSB in the central Urals city of Yekaterinburg said it had "suppressed the illegal activities" of a 33-year-old woman, a resident of Los Angeles with dual citizenship, and taken her into custody.
It said the unnamed woman had been "proactively collecting funds... which were subsequently used to purchase tactical medical items, equipment, means of destruction and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces".
Russian state news agency RIA Novosti posted a video from the FSB showing hooded officers handcuffing and escorting a woman in a white coat with a white hat pulled down over her eyes.
The FSB said she had been acting "against the security of our country" and had been supporting the Ukrainian army while in the United States.
Treason is punishable by up to life in prison under legislation toughened since the start of the military offensive.
Several US nationals are currently imprisoned in Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.
He was arrested last year on espionage charges that he, his employer and the US government have rejected.
Another joint US-Russian citizen, journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, is also being held in pre-trial detention.
He faces charges of failing to register as a "foreign agent" and contravening Russia's strict military censorship laws.
Former US marine Paul Whelan has been in prison in Russia since 2018, serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to negotiate a prisoner exchange to swap Russians imprisoned abroad for US citizens detained in Russia.

According to the 122-page document from Judge Walther Wesser Voltaire, made public by AyiboPost, the president's widow Martine Moise conspired with former Prime Minister Claude Joseph to kill the president in order to replace him herself.
Moise was shot dead when armed men broke into his Port-au-Prince bedroom on the night of July 7, 2021, a raid that left the former first lady injured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jon Stewart decided to take some much needed reporting lessons Monday night from the "journalist" he respects the least: Tucker Carlson.


	With joy in his eyes, Stewart took out pen and paper then asked Carlson to explain how best to do his job.  Stewart then minced clips of the conservative pundit during his controversial reporting trip to Russia — which included an interview with President Vladimir Putin — with journalistic tips he gleaned.


Lie about what your job is 
Lie about what your duty is
Disguise your deception and capitulation to power as moral and noble and based in freedom.

	Stewart described Carlson's demeanor while interviewing Putin as a mixture of "shame, arousal and irregularity." He then showed a clip of Carlson responding "of course" to Putin's description of how World War II was instigated.


	Stewart asked Carlson if great journalism could include field trips. Yes, it could.


	A clip of Carlson sneering at homeless people and taking a deep inhale of bread, of course, spurred some scorn from Stewart.


	Ultimately, Stewart slammed Carlson for failing to provide important context about economic hardship and political oppression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A legal analyst is concerned that the damages Donald Trump was hit with in the fraud trial only compounds his financial problems — and presents a major security threat.
On Monday, Allison Gill of "Mueller, She Wrote" joined with co-host Dana Goldberg on "The Daily Beans" and called the fraud trial fine of $355 million a "doozy." 
Goldberg explained that Trump is going to work on getting the amount down in an appeal, but for now "it's pretty beautiful."
"Plus interest!" Gill chimed in. "So if you take the $355 [million] that Trump owes ... plus 5 percent interest, plus what he owes E. Jean [Carroll], plus 9 percent interest, also in New York, you're looking at $550 million. So, it's going to be pretty difficult."
"All I can think though, is that there's classified documents missing," Gill cautioned. 
"Humm, I know. Highest bidder," agreed Goldberg. 
"How is he going to get this money?" asked Gill. "I mean NRC [National Republican Committee] is broke, NRA [National Rifle Association] is broke, Trump's Save America PAC is bleeding cash from legal representation not just for him but his adult children, and Jared and Ivanka. So, I mean, I guess he can borrow it from Jared?" 
Last month, Trump was hit with $83.3 million in damages after being found liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. He also faces millions in legal fees associated with his four ongoing criminal trials.

On Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron slapped the $355 million demand on him after finding that he and his company inflated the value of Trump Organization properties to secure favorable loans and interest. He has also been barred from conducting business in New York for three years.

Every two months, Michelangelo's masterpiece completed in 1504 undergoes a careful cleaning at its home in Florence's Accademia Gallery, where it has resided for over 150 years.
Considered by many awestruck viewers to represent the perfect man, the 17-foot-high (5.1 metre) sculpture carved from a single block of marble stands alone under the skylight of the domed gallery on Mondays, when the museum is closed.
His personal restorer, Eleonora Pucci, climbs on a scaffolding for an up-close view -- part of a monitoring and cleaning ritual necessary for the preservation of the Renaissance icon visited by over two million visitors last year.
Despite David's good looks and Biblical heritage, the slayer of Goliath needs upkeep.

"This is an excellent opening for a musical biography," analyst David A. Gross said, adding that the film was doing much better with audiences than with critics.
British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir, who plays the iconic reggae singer in the story of his rapid rise and too-soon death, previously drew attention for his portrayal of Malcolm X in "One Night in Miami."
Lashana Lynch plays Rita Marley, and son Ziggy Marley is one of the film's producers.

Gothic fantasia “Poor Things” took five prizes and Holocaust drama “The Zone of Interest” won three.
Christopher Nolan won his first best director BAFTA for “Oppenheimer,” and Cillian Murphy won the best actor prize for playing physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb.
Murphy said he was grateful to play such a “colossally knotty, complex character."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
