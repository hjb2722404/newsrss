Reuters: Putin ally accuses U.S. of involvement in deadly attacks inside Russia 
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A powerful ally of President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that the United States coordinated with Ukraine to kill two pro-war nationalists in Russia and to carry out attacks on critical national infrastructure in an effort to undermine stability. 
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year in what it called "a special military operation," the Kremlin accused the West of unleashing a proxy war against it. 
Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, was killed in a car bomb in August; pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed in a bomb last month; and nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bomb earlier this month. 
Russia also accused Ukraine of attacking the Crimean Bridge last October and accused the West of being behind blasts on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September.

Update #1: US had hand in assassinations of Dugina, Tatarsky, Russia’s top security official asserts (TASS)
 
Update #2: Patrushev said US intelligence agencies coordinated Tatarsky’s murder and the explosion of Prilepin’s car (Eastern Herald)

 
WNU Editor: Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev is, IMHO, the second most powerful leader in Russia after Putin. 
He has just publicly accused the U.S. of waging war inside Russia. 
Let that sink in.]]></summary>

Wang, who has delivered some of the most important and immersive documentaries about China, made "Youth (Spring)" from 2,600 hours of footage.
The unflinching but tender portrait of young workers in textile factories premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday -- a rare documentary to be included in the main competition for the Palme d'Or.
The factory managers are filmed openly as they negotiate dirt-cheap wages and tell workers to leave if they aren't happy -- footage gained thanks to Wang's many years on the ground.

The hazard was produced by depleted uranium munitions destroyed in Ukraine, Nikolay Patrushev has claimed  
The destruction of depleted uranium shells in Ukraine has produced a radioactive cloud which has been blown toward Western Europe, the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, has claimed. 
The UK has supplied this type of munition to Ukraine to be fired from British-made Challenger tanks.

The senior official revealed the purported threat during a government meeting on Friday, in which he accused the US of manipulating its allies to provide “help” to other nations that results in harm being done to the recipients. 
“They ‘helped’ Ukraine this way too, applied pressure to its satellites to supply depleted uranium munitions. Their destruction resulted in a radioactive cloud moving towards Western Europe. They have detected an increase in radiation in Poland,” Patrushev stated.

Update #2: Ukraine's Depleted Uranium Blast: Europe on Brink of 'Environmental Disaster' (Sputnik)

 
WNU Editor: You would think that after Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolay Patrushev issued this nuclear warning there will be an official and public reaction to it. 
But as of this posting there has been no comment from any Western official. Zero coverage from the Western media. And no comment from the Ukraine government. 
But on Ukraine social media it is a different story. 
Many are worried and are pressing the Kyiv government to provide more information and assurances that there is no need for concern.]]></summary>

CNN: Biden tells G7 allies the US will support joint F-16 training effort for Ukrainians 
President Joe Biden informed G7 leaders on Friday that the US will support a joint effort with allies and partners to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16s, a senior administration official tells CNN.
The training is not expected to happen in the US, the official said, and will likely happen entirely in Europe. But US personnel will participate in the training alongside allies and partners in Europe, the official said. It is expected to take several months to complete and the official said the hope is it will begin “in the coming weeks.” 
The decision marks a stark turnaround for Biden, who said earlier this year that he did not believe that Ukraine needed the F-16s. The decision to support the training initiative came together very quickly, officials said, and was made by Biden following meetings with G7 leaders in Hiroshima, Japan, where the topic of F-16s to Ukraine was a key point of discussion.

And while there is hope in the West that the battle for Bakhmut may shift in favor of the Ukrainian army .... Ukraine, Wagner group both say Russian forces in retreat near Bakhmut (CBC/Reuters), the momentum is simply not there. 
At the end of 2022 I wrote that the battle for Bakhmut was the biggest battle of the war, and a "meat grinder" for both armies. This battle also suited the Russian strategy of engaging the Ukraine army in a war of attrition, a tactic that favored the Russians due to their superior firepower and advantages in logistics. 
We are now at the end, and all the worst predictions have come true. 
It is not mentioned much in the West, but the Ukraine military threw in the equivalent of an Army Corps to the defense of Bakhmut, but it was not enough. The Wagner Group has defeated the best that Ukraine can throw in the battle, and it's impact is going to be felt across the board in Ukraine.]]></summary>

It is now poised to spread its influence beyond the sparsely populated region near Madrid, with the party set to make gains in regional and local elections on May 28.
Surveys suggest the main opposition conservative Popular Party (PP) could need the support of Vox to govern in half of the 12 regions casting ballots, just as it did in Castilla y Leon last year.
Polls also indicate the PP is on track to win a year-end general election but will need Vox to form a working majority and oust Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's coalition government from office.

Majid Kazemi, Saleh Mirhashemi and Saeed Yaghoubi were found guilty of "moharebeh" -- or waging "war against God" -- for shooting dead three members of the security forces at a demonstration in the central city of Isfahan on November 16, the judiciary's Mizan Online news website said.
Iran witnessed waves of nationwide protests following the September 16 death of 22-year-old Amini, an Iranian Kurd who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the Islamic republic's strict dress rules for women.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Smiths bassist Andy Rourke, whose pounding rhythms underscored some of the most influential albums in British music history, has died at the age of 59, band-mate Johnny Marr announced Friday.
Rourke died "after a lengthy illness with pancreatic cancer", the Smiths lead guitarist and co-founder said.
"Andy will always be remembered as a kind and beautiful soul by everyone who knew him, and as a supremely gifted musician by people who love music," Marr wrote on Instagram.
Along with drummer Mike Joyce, Rourke provided a whip-tight rhythm section underlying Marr's pioneering chords and co-founder Morrissey's mordant lyrics as the Smiths became one of Britain's best-loved bands in the 1980s.

Mocha brought lashing rain and winds of 195 kilometers per hour (120 miles per hour) to Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh on Sunday, collapsing buildings and turning streets into rivers.
The storm churned up villages, uprooted trees and knocked out communications across much of Myanmar's Rakhine State.
The United Nations said Friday that at least 800,000 people in Myanmar need emergency food aid and other assistance in the wake of the cyclone.

Common Dreams: 'Death Outlives War': Analysis Estimates Post-9/11 US Conflicts Killed Over 4.5 Million 
"The United States government, while not solely responsible for the damage, has a significant obligation to invest in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in post-9/11 war zones," said the author of a new report. 

The post-9/11 War on Terror may have caused at least 4.5 million deaths in around half a dozen countries, according to a report published Monday by the preeminent academic institution studying the costs, casualties, and consequences of a war in which U.S. bombs and bullets are still killing and wounding people in multiple nations. 
The new report from the Costs of War Project at Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs shows "how death outlives war" by examining people killed indirectly by the War on Terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

WNU Editor: The report is focused on blaming the U.S.. But many Western countries (i.e. Canada, U.K., etc.) also willingly participated in these wars and conflicts, and they must also share some of the blame.

RT: Russia contemplates severing ties with Poland

 
An extreme outcome is now a real prospect amid an unfolding row over diplomatic property in Warsaw, Moscow's envoy has acknowledged  
Diplomatic relations between Russia and Poland that are already fraught, may deteriorate further or even be completely severed, Moscow’s top diplomat to Warsaw has warned. Ambassador Sergey Andreev's comments came after the Polish prime minister suggested this week that kicking the envoy out of the country would be “easy” to do. 
Andreev said there “was always a possibility” that ties could be severed, when asked about such a scenario by the Izvestia newspaper. “Whether it becomes reality depends on the decisions of our leadership and the Polish authorities,” he said in an interview published on Tuesday.

CNBC: Global debt nears record highs as rate hikes trigger ‘crisis of adaptation,’ top trade body says 
* The IIF said the combination of such high debt levels and rising interest rates has driven up the cost of servicing that debt, triggering concerns about leverage in the financial system. 
* “At close to $305 trillion, global debt is now $45 trillion higher than its pre-pandemic level and is expected to continue increasing rapidly,” the IIF said. 
The global debt pile grew by $8.3 trillion in the first quarter to a near-record high of $305 trillion as the global economy faced a “crisis of adaptation” to rapid monetary policy tightening by central banks, according to a closely-watched report from the Institute of International Finance. 
The finance industry body said the combination of such high debt levels and rising interest rates has driven up the cost of servicing that debt, triggering concerns about leverage in the financial system.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea accused the U.S. and South Korea of ramping up "nuclear blackmail" with joint military drills, pledging to take corresponding action against what it called "warmongers' madness," state media KCNA said on Friday.
U.S. and South Korean forces have been staging an intensified series of annual springtime exercises since March, including air and sea drills involving a U.S. aircraft carrier and heavy bombers.
North Korea has reacted angrily to the exercises, calling them a rehearsal for invasion.
"Their plot to crush us militarily is another clear indication that the enemy warmongers' madness has reached a point where it cannot be overlooked," KCNA said. "The frantic nuclear war fuss among U.S. and puppet warlike bellwethers is bound to trigger corresponding responses".
Pyongyang would continue to develop its weapons programmes, KCNA said, calling it a "legitimate right of a sovereign state to have more powerful means of self-defence" to fend off "serious situations and prospective threats".
North Korea has been stepping up military activity in recent months, unveiling designs for new, smaller nuclear warheads, firing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. and testing what it called a nuclear-capable underwater attack drone.
This week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a military satellite station, saying successfully launching a spy satellite is an "urgent requirement of the prevailing security environment".
Kim has said he prioritised a spy satellite programme as part of efforts to advance surveillance technology to improve the country's ability to strike targets in a crisis.
The reclusive country in December conducted what it called an important "final phase" test for a spy satellite and said it would complete preparations for the launch by April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roger Ailes before his death told his wife that Rupert Murdoch’s two sons sought his ouster and wanted to turn Fox News into a centrist or even liberal outlet, Elizabeth Ailes said Thursday during an appearance on Newsmax.
“Roger made running Fox News look easy, and as you know, it was anything but,” she told Newsmax host Eric Bolling.
“Rupert has the checkbook, he has money, but he couldn't hold a candle to Roger in terms of genius, and the ideas that Roger put forth back in '96,” she said, noting that it was her late husband who developed the the right-wing network’s “fair and balanced” and “we report, you decide” slogans.
“That was a challenge to the establishment mainstream media who thought that just because they said they were objective people we would take them at their word, and we all know that they were very liberal all that time.” 
The former Fox News CEO’s wife claims that Murdoch’s sons, Lachlan and James, played a role in Ailes’ ouster from the company.
Roger Ailes left Fox News in July 2016 amid a torrent of sexual harassment allegations by subordinates including Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. 
“My thought is that I go back to July 2016 when events unfolded, and after 20 years of running the channel and turning it into a $20 billion asset, throwing off $2 billion in profits, the sons Lachlan and James had decided that they wanted Roger gone,” she said.
“Roger said to me, these useless kids tweedle dumb and tweedle dumber are going to ruin the channel and turn it into CNN and that's exactly what's happening," she added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says China should be “honouring the terms” of the Free Trade Agreement after China eased some of the tariffs it had on Australian trade. 

“We should continue to welcome progress, and the fact China firstly removed its inability or unwillingness to actually have dialogue with Australia, secondly, has eased some of the tariffs or sanctions in some areas, that’s a good thing,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia.
 
“The expectations are that China should be fully honouring the terms of the Australia-China free trade agreement.

“We shouldn’t have to do the type of work around our timber industry, our live seafood industry, let alone be facing continued tariffs on our barley and wine industries.

“China should be ensuring that they remove all of those sanctions, all of those different tariffs, so they are honouring the terms of the free trade agreement they voluntarily entered into, honouring the commitments they gave to the World Trade Organisation. 

“They should be doing all of that, and we should be expecting them to do that without any sense of condition placed upon Australia.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Birmingham says he hopes the White House puts “absolute priority” on Joe Biden coming to the Pacific Islands to talk about defence after the US President cancelled his trip to focus on domestic affairs. 

“Perhaps the most disappointing part of President Biden’s cancelled scheduling in relation to his visit to our part of the Pacific is the absence and the cancellation of the trip to Papua New Guinea,” Mr Birmingham told Sky News Australia. 

“That was going to be a very significant and symbolic visit.

“Symbolic in being the first US President to visit Papua New Guinea, significant in terms of building upon President Biden hosting all the Pacific Island leaders in Washington and then returning that visit by engaging with Pacific Island leaders.”]]></summary>

Wall Street Journal: Accounting Error Leaves Pentagon With $3 Billion More in Arms for Ukraine, U.S. Says 
WASHINGTON—The Pentagon has overcounted the value of the weaponry it has sent to Ukraine by at least $3 billion, an error that could eliminate the need to ask Congress for more money to keep Kyiv in the fight this spring, people familiar with the situation said. 
The military services inadvertently used a higher value for at least some of the weaponry the Pentagon sent to Ukraine, using valuations for new equipment instead of the older gear pulled out of U.S. stockpiles, the people said. 
An internal audit identified the difference in March, and now the Biden administration may not need to seek additional funding from Congress for next year, the people said. The Pentagon has sent nearly $40 billion to help Ukraine defend itself since Russia invaded in February 2022.

WNU Editor: Talk about a neat accounting trick. 
Say this weapon system is not worth $1 million. Instead it is now worth $800,000 thereby freeing $200,000 to spend on something else. 
And here is an easy prediction. 
When the US comes around to replace that $1 million weapon system that they now say is worth $800,000, I am willing to bet that the replacement cost will be $1.5 million (or more).

Since 2017, junior sailors assigned to aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN-73) were subject to some of the toughest living conditions in the military, according to a new Navy investigation released on Thursday. 
Sailors assigned to the carrier over its almost six-year-long maintenance period at HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding experienced poor living conditions, up to three-hour commutes and isolation from their families and peers as part of life in the shipyard. 
Complaints about the life as a George Washington sailor, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, fell on deaf ears within Navy leadership, according to the quality of life investigation released on Thursday and reviewed by USNI News.

DNYUZ/New York Times: As the U.S. Attends the G7, China Hosts a Summit of Its Own 
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is kicking off a summit on Thursday that the country is heralding as a historic milestone, rolling out the red carpet for five Central Asian countries that are critical to China’s regional ambitions. 
The inaugural China-Central Asia summit is part of China’s broader aim to strengthen economic and political partnerships with like-minded countries, to counter what it sees as a U.S.-dominated world order that is trying to contain and suppress China. 
Notably, Mr. Xi’s summit was scheduled on the eve of the annual Group of 7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which begins Friday and will be attended by leaders of the world’s wealthiest large democracies, including President Biden. 
A major topic for the G7 leaders will be how to address what the United States describes as China’s growing assertiveness.

New York Times: The Latest Flash Point Among Ukraine’s Allies Is Whether to Send F-16s 
A fresh push by Britain and the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter planes has exposed the latest fault line among Western allies who have wrangled repeatedly over sending powerful weapons of war, once again pitting a reluctant United States against some of its closest European partners. 
Several European allies are prepared to give their F-16s to Ukraine. But the Biden administration, which must approve any transfers of the American-made planes, remains unconvinced that Ukraine needs the expensive jets, which are a staple of many modern military arsenals. 
So deep is Washington’s skepticism that Kyiv’s pilots are currently not even allowed to train on the F-16s that are owned by European states, according to a senior Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity to frankly discuss the sensitive diplomatic issue.

Update: We may soon see a change in US policy .... Exclusive: U.S. could train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s in 4 months (Yahoo News).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Thursday retracted his claim that four Indigenous children missing for more than two weeks after an airplane crash in the Amazon had been found alive.
Writing on Twitter, Petro said he had deleted his tweet from Wednesday night in which he had announced the rescue of the four children, including an 11-month-old baby.
"I am sorry for what happened. The military forces and Indigenous communities will continue in their tireless search to give the country the news it is waiting for," he said in his retraction.
More than 100 soldiers have been deployed with sniffer dogs to search for the minors who were traveling in an airplane that crashed on May 1, leaving three adults including the pilot and the children's mother dead.
Rescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old include a 13, nine and four-year-old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.
"At this time there is no other priority other than progressing with the search until finding them," added Petro. "The children's lives are the most important thing."
Petro's stunning announcement on Wednesday had been met with uncertainty as he gave no details about where or how the children had been rescued, nor how they had survived alone in the jungle.
Amid widespread confusion, the military has not confirmed any rescue.
Avianline Charters, owner of the crashed aircraft, had previously said that one of its pilots in the search area was told the children had been found and that they "were being transported by boat downriver and that they were all alive."
But the company also said that "there has been no official confirmation" that the children were out of danger, and thunderstorms posed a risk to them reaching safety.
Petro said on Thursday that the news of the supposed rescue had been provided by the government's Institute of Family Welfare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British musician Sting warned against songs written by artificial intelligence in an interview with the BBC published Thursday, urging caution about the technology.
The 71-year-old former frontman of The Police said, "The building blocks of music belong to us, to human beings."
"That's going to be a battle we all have to fight in the next couple of years: Defending our human capital against AI," he said.
The use of AI in music is the subject of debate in the industry, with some denouncing copyright abuses and others praising its prowess.
AI technology was used to imitate Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd in a song released last month called "Heart On My Sleeve".
The viral track was briefly available on music streaming platforms before it was pulled following a copyright complaint from Universal Music Group, which publishes both artists through a subsidiary.
David Guetta meanwhile recently used AI to add a vocal in the style of rapper Eminem to a song for a live show.
But the French producer said he will not release it commercially.
"The tools are useful, but we have to be driving them," Sting said.
"I don't think we can allow the machines to just take over. We have to be wary," he added.
Sting -- real name Gordon Sumner -- shot to fame with The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as "Roxanne", "Message in a Bottle" and "Walking on the Moon".
He then forged a solo career with classics such as "Englishman in New York", "Fields of Gold" and "Shape of My Heart".

ERR News: FT: Kallas pleads with local companies to stop trade with Russia 
Prime Minister Kaja Kallas (Reform) told UK newspaper the Financial Times that she had to "plead" with companies to find a "moral compass" and decline deals that may result in Moscow accessing sanctioned goods. 
The paper's recent investigation into Russian sanctions evasion identified $1 billion of goods having disproportionately passed through the Baltic states, believed to be part of Moscow's "ghost trade". Local companies have also been involved.
"Kallas accused local companies of hypocrisy, telling them: "You are very vocal about . . . Ukraine and Russia and security . . . but in a hidden way . . . you are agreeing [with Moscow]"." the paper wrote. 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have seen a rise in exports to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia transiting through Russia.

More than 40 nations have agreed to set up a system to tally the damage Russia has inflicted on Ukraine in the hope of getting reparations, adding to the international legal challenges the Kremlin is facing. 
The register of damages, which will allow Ukrainian victims of war to catalog the harm they have suffered, found a plethora of support among the 46-nation Council of Europe summit in Iceland. 
In total, 40 member states of the council agreed to join on May 17 or will do so in the future. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Hungary, and Turkey will not join, at least not initially.

WNU Editor: When this war is finally over, Ukraine, or what is left of it, will be owing the West hundreds of billions if not more. They cannot pay this amount. This "Register of Damage" is more about EU nations being paid, and nothing to do with helping Ukraine.

According to Turkish sources, yesterday NATO held an emergency meeting on the state of air defense of the largest base hubs for Ukraine in Poland and Slovakia in light of the failure of the Patriot air defense system in the defense of Kyiv.

WNU Editor: The official line is that the Patriot systems in Kyiv only sffered "minor damage" .... US officials say damage to Patriot missile defense system was minimal following Russian attack near Kyiv (CNN). More here .... Patriot missile system in Ukraine damaged but operational: US (France 24).
I do not know if the Patriot systems were damaged or destroyed, but I do know that since yesterday Ukrainians are now being warned/threatened to not post images or videos of Ukraine's air defense systems or how many missiles were launched during a barrage on social media. 

 
Update: Good point. See tweet below.

30 US Patriot PAC-3 MSE launch at a cost of $5 million per missile. That’s $150 million gone within 2 mins. At the end the Patriot launch platforms were destroyed by Russian missiles. Why would any military still want to buy Patriot after this failure? pic.twitter.com/JiNr06y0Rt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: As G-7 Summit kicks off in Hiroshima, China and Russia are on everyone’s minds 
* The Group of 7 will meet at a crucial time for slowing global growth as a result of hawkish central banks aiming to bring down inflation. 
* Leaders will discuss international trade and security as the world grapples with an ongoing war in Ukraine and worries over U.S.-China decoupling persist. 
The annual Group of 7 summit officially kicks off on Friday in Hiroshima, Japan. 
Leaders of the seven major industrial democracies – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States – will discuss the future of global relations and the world economy as it faces a number of uncertainties: growing geopolitical tensions, central banks’ combat against rising inflation and a U.S. debt ceiling deadlock. 
Also under the spotlight are the countries invited for the gathering, including Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Vietnam – nations with pivotal roles to play in regional alliances as the rift between Washington and Beijing deepens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong must not "recommend books with unhealthy ideas", the city's leader John Lee said on Thursday, following the removal of library books related to the deadly Tiananmen Square crackdown and other political issues.
The finance hub has undergone huge legal and political changes since Beijing imposed a national security law on the territory in 2020, silencing dissent following massive, and at times violent, pro-democracy protests the year before.
The latest measure comes after a prominent political cartoonist -- whose work often satirized Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China -- was suspended indefinitely from publishing in a mainstream newspaper, and his books were removed from the city's libraries over the past week.
The flash removal prompted Hong Kong journalists to comb the …]]></summary>

However MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat's determination to modify the lese-majeste laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn has quickly emerged as a key issue that could block his path to power.
The monarchy has long had an exalted status in Thai society, and is shielded from criticism by section 112 of the penal code, which punishes infractions with jail terms of up to 15 years.
Posters of the king are ubiquitous, from shops and homes to public buildings and motorway billboards, and cinema-goers are expected to stand for the royal anthem before screenings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authorities in Ravenna issued an immediate evacuation order Thursday for three villages threatened by floods after heavy rains left nine people dead across northeastern Italy.
Buses were being sent to help residents leave Villanova di Ravenna, Filetto and Roncalceci after the river Lamone burst its banks.
Nearly two dozen rivers and streams have flooded across the southeast of the Emilia Romagna region following downpours earlier this week, submerging entire neighborhoods and farmland.
More than 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and hundreds of landslides were reported, regional officials said.
The rain stopped mid-afternoon on Wednesday and meteorologists said they expected no significant rainfall on Thursday.

Fahmy, who started off in an Old Cairo workshop about 50 years ago, said her focus has been designs that "resonate with Egyptian identity".
Artists and artisans in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, draw from a history that spans ancient Pharaonic times, the Mamluk, Ottoman and modern eras.
"We are lucky to be able to draw on 6,000 years of history," said textile designer Goya Gallagher, founder of Cairo-based Malaika Linens, which makes high-end household pieces.

"The main challenge is making sure our pieces are timeless, that they're very well made and always hand-made," she said at the company workshop on the west…]]></summary>

It was sold by Sotheby's following a four-minute bidding battle between two bidders, the auction house said in a statement.
The Bible was bought by former US diplomat Alfred Moses on behalf of an American nonprofit that will gift it to the ANU Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Israel, Sotheby's said.
"The Hebrew Bible is the most influential book in history and constitutes the bedrock of Western civilization. I rejoice in knowing that it belongs to the Jewish People," said Moses, an ambassador under president Bill Clinton.

The defense ministry said Russian forces had launched 30 cruise missiles from land, sea and air, targeting several regions and killing one person in Odesa.
The military said its air defense units had destroyed 29 of the cruise missiles and shot down four drones.
"A series of air attacks on Kyiv, unprecedented in their power, intensity and variety, is continuing," said Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv's civil and military administration.
The attack follows other recent barrages in which Ukraine claimed to have downed several advanced Russian Kinzhal missiles.

President Joe Biden arrived in Japan on Thursday for a truncated Asia visit meant to bolster allies amid China’s growing military and economic ambitions. 
The trip, once planned for eight days, has been shortened by half; two of Biden’s three stops were scrapped so he could return to Washington for negotiations over raising the US debt ceiling. 
Left with only a stop in Japan for the Group of Seven summit, Biden is attempting to coalesce the leaders of some of the world’s largest economies around a commitment to take on Beijing’s aggressions and support Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion.

Germany’s much-hyped Zeitenwende, which promised a significant boost in defense spending, has so far yielded few tangible new investments in military capabilities and been overshadowed by the government’s various perceived prevarications on arming Ukraine. European militaries’ stores of critical munitions and equipment have been found wanting amidst the rush to support Ukraine’s resistance, and its defense industrial base faces significant challenges in ramping up production to replenish, let alone grow, its customers’ stockpiles.

How Ukraine could become the next South Korea. 
U.S. officials are planning for the growing possibility that the Russia-Ukraine war will turn into a frozen conflict that lasts many years — perhaps decades — and joins the ranks of similar lengthy face-offs in the Korean peninsula, South Asia and beyond. 
The options discussed within the Biden administration for a long-term “freeze” include where to set potential lines that Ukraine and Russia would agree not to cross, but which would not have to be official borders. The discussions — while provisional — have taken place across various U.S. agencies and in the White House.

Update: US wants to ‘freeze’ Ukraine conflict – Politico (RT)

 
WNU Editor: The Kremlin is not going to agree to a freeze in the conflict. 
The overwhelming consensus among the think tanks in Moscow is that a ceasefire (i.e. freezing the conflict) will be a strategic defeat. The reason why is outlined in the tweet below.

I spoke about this from the very beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine. 
Elena Panina, Institute of Russian Strategic Studies: "Stopping hostilities in Ukraine without the complete defeat of the Kiev junta is a strategic loss for Russia.

* U.S. consumers are showing significantly less concern about the U.S. energy situation than they did one year ago. 
* The U.S. House of Representatives may once again consider a piece of legislation to pressure the OPEC oil producers’ group to stop making output cuts. 
* The bill may be retaliation against the Arab OPEC countries, and a warning to others, for normalizing ties with Iran and Syria. 
 In early May, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary was reportedly considering a bill to pressure the  OPEC oil producers’ group to stop making output cuts by revoking the sovereign immunity that has protected OPEC+ members and their national oil companies from lawsuits over price collusion. (The committee previously passed the bill in 2018, 2019 and 2021.) 
The OPEC Basket Price has hovered in the mid $70s, not historically high, though U.S. politicians like to talk down the price of gasoline before the summer driving season begins. (Saudi Arabia needs a price of $80.90 USD to balance its budget, and fund the diversification of its economy.)

Insider: Revealed: Vladimir Putin's secret Black Sea bunker 
You would think that the architechts who designed Vladimir Putin's palace thought of everything. 
After all, the 190,000-square-foot, billion-dollar complex, perched on a rugged bluff overlooking  the Black Sea, has every luxury that an autocrat could possibly desire. As revealed by Alexei Navalny's investigation, the palace has its own church, wine cellar, and casino. It has a hookah lounge complete with a stripper pole, an arboretum, and an ice rink for the hockey games Putin likes to play with cronies. But good luck ordering takeout — security is tight. Putin's imperial dacha is sealed off from the country he rules by 17,000 acres of woodland and a special no-fly zone. 
The precautions are more than paranoia on Putin's part. Earlier this month, Russian authorities claimed that two drones had attempted to assassinate Putin in a failed strike that ended in an explosion above the Kremlin.

Japan and China on Tuesday made their first call on a new military hotline after years of negotiations to set up the communication channel. As per a report by AFP, the development was confirmed by the defence ministries of both countries. Japanese Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada, in a statement, said that he held a conversation for 20 minutes with his Chinese counterpart Li Shangfu, the news agency reported. 
"Hamada mentioned the existence of security concerns between Japan and China, such as the situation in the East China Sea," it said. 
He "stated that it is necessary to have candid communication especially when there are concerns about Japan-China relations". 
The call was confirmed by Beijing, too, saying the air and maritime hotline would "contribute to further maintaining regional peace and stability". 
The hotline was launched on March 31 this year and had been mooted by both sides for over a decade as a way to avert unexpected clashes in the East China Sea.

XIAN, China (Reuters) - Central Asian heads of state converged in China's historic city of Xian on Thursday for one-on-ones with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seal pledges of "enduring" friendship, and paving the way for a summit expected to result in a regional pact with Beijing.
The bilateral talks will set the stage for a group meeting on Friday, the first in-person gathering of the six leaders, where Xi will deliver an "important" speech and an "important" political document will be signed, China's foreign ministry has said.
Across the Silk Road city of Xian, banners, billboards and even taxi signs were set up to promote the summit, with some in both Chinese and Russian.

Ecuador’s embattled President Guillermo Lasso, who was facing a looming impeachment vote, has triggered a constitutional clause to dissolve government, a politically fraught move that could spark protests with the country already tackling a fragile security situation. 
The Ecuadorian leader invoked a procedure known as “mutual death,” whereby the opposition-led National Assembly is dissolved and snap elections will be called, according to a decree published on the website of the presidency.

The chair of Ukraine’s Supreme Court was removed from his post after being arrested in a bribery investigation, two anti-corruption bodies said on Tuesday. 
The agencies did not identify the chair by name, but said it was the Supreme Court chief. On Tuesday, Vsevolod Knyazev was dismissed as chief justice after an overwhelming majority of the court’s judges voted to strip him of the position, according to local news reports. 
The authorities accused the justice of accepting $2.7 million in bribes. 
“This is a dark day in the history of the court,” the court’s judges said in a joint statement. “We must be worthy and withstand such a blow.”

Moscow Times/AFP: Russian Oil Exports Hit Post-Invasion High – IEA 
Russia's oil exports rose in April to the highest level since its invasion of Ukraine, boosting revenues by $1.7 billion despite Western sanctions, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday. 
The Paris-based organization said Russian exports increased by 50,000 barrels per day to 8.3 million bpd last month, estimating that the country did not fully deliver on a threat to cut production sharply.
"Indeed, Russia may be boosting volumes to make up for lost revenue," the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.

The country's oil export revenues rose by $1.7 billion to $15 billion in April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso has dissolved the country's parliament in the middle of impeachment proceedings against him.
Lasso's office said in a statement on Wednesday that the president would rule by decree until new parliamentary elections are held.
A date for new elections would be set within a week, according to the statement.
"It is impossible to solve the challenges with a parliament whose goal is to destabilize the country," Lasso said in a televised address. "I have to give an answer to the political crisis. Ecuador needs a new political and social pact."
Lasso is accused of knowing about unfavourable contracts between the state oil transport company Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana and the private shipping company Amazonas Tankers, but doing nothing to modify or terminate the deals after taking office.
The unfavorable contracts are said to have cost the Ecuadorian state several million dollars.
Lasso on Tuesday rejected allegations of embezzlement that have been levelled against him in parliament.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Johnny Depp hit back on Wednesday against years of negative press, telling the Cannes Film Festival that most of the stories about him were "fantastically, horrifically written fiction".
Speaking to reporters a day after the premiere of his new film "Jeanne du Barry" on the festival's opening night, he said he did not care about being boycotted by Hollywood.
"Do I feel boycotted now? No 'coz I don't think about Hollywood, I don't have much need for Hollywood," said the actor.
"It's a very strange, funny time where everyone must fall into line," he added. "If you want to live that kind of life, I wish you the best. I'll be on the other side."
Depp lost his part in the Harry Potter spin-off "Fantastic Beasts" films after his ex-wife Amber Heard accused him of domestic abuse.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
