After achieving a degree of success with the EV6 two years ago, the Koreans have upped the ante with an imposing and well-equipped EV9, albeit it at a high price. The first lavishly equipped Launch Edition with all-wheel drive will bend your bank balance to the tune of €83,190 in Europe. Prices for the base version with no gizmos hover around €70,000.

Politico:  Ukraine declares war on Russia’s Black Sea shipping

 
Kyiv warns it’s ‘completely unjustifiable’ for Western vessels to continue shipping Russian oil. 
Russian ports and ships on the Black Sea — including tankers carrying millions of barrels of oil to Europe — could justifiably be attacked by the Ukrainian military as part of efforts to weaken Moscow's war machine, a senior Kyiv official warned Monday in the wake of two recent attacks on Russian vessels. 
"Everything the Russians are moving back and forth on the Black Sea are our valid military targets," Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told POLITICO, saying the move was retaliation for Russia withdrawing from the U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal and unleashing a series of missile attacks on agricultural stores and ports. 
“This story started with Russia blocking the grain corridor, threatening to attack our vessels, destroying our ports,” Ustenko said. “Our maritime infrastructure is under constant attack."

Bloomberg: Rare Russian VIP jet in North Korea spurs arms deal concern 
An unusual sighting of a Russian military jet in North Korea is stoking concern that Kim Jong Un is selling Vladimir Putin weapons as ties strengthen between the sanctioned states. 
Tracking data from FlightRadar24 shows the Russian Air Force Ilyushin IL-62M flying from Moscow to Pyongyang on July 31 and returning on Aug. 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South China Morning Post: South China Sea: Beijing tells Philippines to remove grounded warship from disputed reef after latest clash in long-running territorial dispute 
Beijing has urged Manila to remove an "illegally" grounded warship from a reef in the disputed Spratly Islands after an incident over the weekend in which Chinese coastguard ships fired water cannons at vessels supplying troops stationed there. 
While Beijing defended the coastguard's actions as "professional and restrained" on Monday, the Philippine government summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest about the incident on the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. 
The disputed reef - also known as the Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines or Renai Shoal in China - has been occupied by the Philippines since 1999 when a second world war-era warship was run aground on the atoll to assert Manila's claims over the area.

WNU Editor: The Chinese position is very clear .... China again urges the Philippines to immediately tow away the grounded warship from Ren'ai Reef -- part of China's Nansha Islands (Global Times). 
Update: This can quickly escalate into something bigger .... China-Philippines dispute could escalate into superpower conflict, say analysts (Helen Davidson, The Guardian).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[London-based sex worker Marin Scarlett and right-wing populist Nigel Farage might initially appear unlikely campaigning allies, but when it comes to the pitfalls of banking in Britain they share a common cause.
"It's ridiculous that financial institutions can act like moral arbiters," Scarlett told AFP, echoing Farage's exact same criticism last month after a scandal erupted around his treatment by British banks.
Farage's complaints about the closure of his account with the upmarket Coutts, a subsidiary of NatWest used by the late Queen Elizabeth II, dominated the news for days, prompted questions in parliament and cost top executives their jobs.
For Scarlett, who is in her thirties and started out as a sex worker 15 years ago, the sudden uproar was galling, given arbitrary account closure…]]></summary>

Victoria Nuland, a veteran envoy and acting deputy secretary of state, said she met for more than two hours with military chiefs who ousted democratically elected Western ally Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.
Nuland's trip, conducted in secrecy until she left, came after the expiration of a deadline set by ECOWAS to reinstate Bazoum by midnight (2300 GMT) on Sunday or risk military intervention.
The 15-nation bloc is reconvening for its own diplomatic push on the crisis with a summit Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja.

The musician's funeral cortege will pass along the seafront in the town of Bray, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Dublin, where she lived for 15 years.
The Grammy award-winning singer, best known for her cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U", died last month after being found unresponsive at her London home. She was 56.
The musician, who rose to international fame in the 1990s, will be mourned at a funeral attended by family and friends before a private burial.
Her family offered the public the chance to pay their final respects by organizing the cortege through Bray, saying she loved the town and its residents.

A peace plan pitched by Ukraine and its allies to more than 40 countries this weekend in Saudi Arabia brought little in the way of concrete steps to stop the war or reverse Russia’s territorial gains. 
The most tangible outcome from the Jeddah meetings was a plan to form working groups under various points of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point “peace formula” — on areas including food supply and nuclear security — according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they’re not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

But the junta, under self-declared head of state General Abdourahamane Tiani, former commander of Niger's presidential guard, instead closed the airspace and pledged to defend the country.

Reuters: Top US official traveled to Niger and held 'difficult' talks with junta officials 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. State Department's acting No. 2 traveled to Niger and held talks on Monday with senior officials from the country's junta which seized power last month, but made no progress in meetings she described as "difficult". 
U.S. Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was in Niamey, she told reporters in a call, and met with Moussa Salaou Barmou, the self-proclaimed defense chief of Niger's junta and three other colonels supporting him. 
Washington offered ways to restore democratic order, Nuland said, but the junta officials showed little interest. The U.S. side conveyed what is at stake in terms of economic assistance and other aid if the situation is not reversed, she added.

The Independent: North Korea’s Kim Jong-un orders increase in arms factory capacity for ‘war readiness’, state media reports

 
Kim Jong-un calls for rapid expansion in ‘production’ during a visit to a factory producing engines for cruise missiles and drones. 
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has asked his country’s key weapons factories to boost their arsenal capacity and perfect the “war readiness” as he toured the facilities producing artillery systems and launchpads for nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, state media reported on Sunday. 
The reclusive leader called for “rapidly expanding production” during his visit to a factory that produces engines for cruise missiles and drones. 
The 39-year-old supreme leader complimented workers of an unspecified factory manufacturing launcher trucks for establishing a “solid foundation” for production but asked for the supply of the vehicles to be ramped up as a top priority for the military, reported North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency.

* Chonhar bridge was damaged and small bridge across Tonky Strait was shelled 
Ukrainian troops damaged two key bridges leading into Russian-occupied Crimea with 'Storm Shadow missiles supplied by the UK' today. 
The Chonhar bridge linking mainland Ukraine to Crimea was damaged and a small bridge across the Tonky Strait was also shelled. 
Continuing attacks by Zelensky's forces are making it increasingly hard for Putin's invading army to get on and off the peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.

WNU Editor: The Military Summary Channel (video below) wonders if the SU-24s that Ukraine used to launch these missiles flew in from Poland. This is not the first time that I am hearing such speculation. For the past few months there is a lot of talk on Russian social media sites that monitor and report on the war that Poland has provided an airbase or two  for Ukraine to launch airstrikes from.

Threat of military intervention made by ECOWAS ‘must be taken very seriously,’ French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna says. 
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna on Saturday backed efforts to reverse a military coup in Niger, following a meeting in Paris with the African country’s Prime Minister Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou and Niger’s Ambassador to France, Aïchatou Boulama Kané. 
France “firmly and resolutely supports the efforts of ECOWAS to thwart this attempted putsch,” the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement, referring to a group of 15 West African countries that has given the putschists in Niger until Sunday to step down or face a possible military intervention. 
“The future of Niger and the stability of the entire region are at stake,” the ministry said.

Update #1: France backs regional bid to oust coup leaders in Niger ahead of deadline (CNN)
 
Update #2: France backs ECOWAS push to reverse Niger military coup (Al Jazeera) 
WNU Editor: France and the US are hoping that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will cobble together a military force to reverse the military coup in Niger. Easier said than done. Some member states are against any form of military intervention against Niger .... Burkina Faso, Mali warn against military intervention in Niger (Al Jazeera), and two, the member states of ECOWAS have limited military capabilities to launch such an operation against Niger's new leaders. 
Bottom line. 
The West will need to get directly involved in launching such an operation to quash this coup, and they already have the means to do it.  There are currently about 3,000 Western troops in Mali .... Which Western countries have foreign forces in Niger? (Al Jazeera).]]></summary>

Flight tracking website Flightradar24 is showing that there are currently no aircraft in Niger's skies. 
The West African group of countries, Ecowas, had earlier warned it could use force if President Mohamed Bazoum was not reinstated by 23:00 GMT on Sunday.

"Harry doesn't want to become a prisoner of the palace. He and Meghan are offering to rent an apartment at Kensington Palace and … hopes that will please William and show that they're serious about coming back," the insider told OK! magazine.

Daily Mail Columnist Richard Eden said the Sussexes will need to "apologise".

"The only hope there could be is that Harry and Meghan apologise and say we're really sorry for all the damage we've done, and we'd like to make amends. Unless that happens, I can't see any kind of reconciliation."]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
