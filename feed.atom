 OilPrice.com: The World’s Third-Largest Economy Is Facing A Looming Energy Crisis 
Japan is facing an energy crisis that can severely hurt the world's third-largest economy as it is forced to tackle a combination of a weak local currency, the fallout from the Ukraine war, and a heatwave. 
Japan already had a significant energy import bill as it depends on foreign oil and gas for 90 percent of its needs. But as the yen fell to the lowest in 20 years, Japan's bill became even bigger, with the price rise in crude oil, which has been some 40 percent in dollar terms since the start of 2022, reaching a whopping 70 percent in yen terms. 
"A confluence of factors, including the higher fuel prices since the war and the tumbling currency, is putting a significant pressure on Japan's energy security, making this one of the most serious energy crises Japan has had," said Jane Nakano, a senior fellow at Washington-based think tank the Center for Strategic & International Studies.

Update #2: Japan, South Korea buyers have not yet been asked to pay roubles for Russian LNG imports (Reuters)   
WNU Editor: Because Japan imports 90% off its energy needs, it needs to continue to buy Russian oil and natural gas. Japan is also the country that proposed to the G7 to cap Russian oil export prices at half the current rate. 
Update #3: Japan is not the only Asian facing an energy crisis .... Factbox: Asia-Pacific economies face escalating energy crisis (A&P Global).]]></summary>

New immune-evading Omicron subvariant BA.5 is now dominant in the U.S.—and previous heavy hitter “stealth Omicron” is now a shadow of its former self, according to federal health data released Tuesday. 
BA.5 is estimated to have caused nearly 54% of COVID infections in the U.S. last week, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Along with twin variant BA.4, it swept South Africa this spring thanks to its ability to evade immunity from both prior infection and vaccination. 
The week before that, the two variants combined made up slightly more than half of U.S. cases. But last week, BA.5 accomplished the same feat alone, without the help of BA.4, which came in third at 16.5%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his invasion of Ukraine he cited the "self-cleansing of society" and the "purification" of the motherland. It led foreign policy experts to fear that the invasion was part of a larger war of genocide.
By the end of May, Russian state TV was threatening to invade Poland. Now that the war has been going on for 131 days, a Daily Beast report cited Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko hinted that the next war will be against Europe as a whole. 
“The time has come for the forgetful Europe to give itself a moral cleansing,” Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state television's BelTA.
Lukashenko talked about fighting Nazis in World War II, known to Russians as the “Great Patriotic War,” and said that their efforts aren't over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the United States Catholic bishops continue a debate over whether politicians should get communion, another group of bishops is working on making desperate deals with drug traffickers, Vice News said citing Mexican newspaper Milenio. 
“There is a need for a social pact,” said Bishop Sigifredo Noriega. “A pact where even the bad guys could have a say.”
The "bad guys" he's talking about are organized crime groups that have been increasing decades-long violence in Mexico. The Catholic church is estimated to have multiple billions of dollars but they're not about to use it for a holy war against the drug cartels in Central America. 
Two priests were killed last month in church and they are searching for solutions. The assumption seems to be that giving them "a say" might persuade the narcos to work cooperatively within the community to traffick their drugs without so many murders.

"The bishop of Zacatecas suggested 'directly speaking' with members of organized crime," said the report. It explained, "Zacatecas is one of Mexico’s states most affected by violence related to drug trafficking, and is leading in the ranking on murders this year."

Father Javier Campos was 79 years old when he was murdered and Father Joaquín Mora was 80. Their deaths are said to be a result of drug boss José Noriel Portillo “El Chueco” (of the Sinaloa Cartel) chased a tourist guide into the church. The priests tried to protect the man but they were all three killed, said Chihuahua state authorities. They were then dumped two days later about 125 miles from the church. 
"The murder of the Jesuit priests reinforces the call to examine the security strategy in Mexico, as we are experiencing a wave of historical violence: the number of murders so far this six-year term exceeds 122,000 people," the Archdiocese of Mexico said in an editorial.

Jump out of a perfectly good airplane, charge a machine gun nest, be stationed at Ft. Irwin – these are just three of the myriad miseries American patriots are willing to endure to defend our country. But today's military is asking too much of our young people, as evidenced by the crashing recruitment rates that threaten to deplete a military already running short of soldiers. Have our young people suddenly turned from heroes to zeros, ne'er-do-well heirs of the brave warriors who confronted the forces of tyrannical gun control at Lexington and Concord? 
No. The kids are alright. The problems lie echelons above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's finance and health ministers resigned on Tuesday, in what looked to be the final blow for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's premiership after he had tried to apologize for the latest scandal to dog his administration.
Both finance minister Rishi Sunak and health minister Sajid Javid resigned in what appeared to be a choreographed release of letters to the prime minister, in which both took aim at his ability to run an administration that adhered to standards.
The resignations came as Johnson was apologising for what he said was a mistake for not realizing that a former minister in charge of pastoral care was unsuitable for a job in government after complaints of sexual misconduct were made against him.
Both had formerly publicly supported Johnson during months of scandal over his administration's conduct and a damning report into parties at his Downing Street office and residence that broke strict COVID-19 lockdown rules.
Sunak, who had reportedly clashed with the prime minister in private about spending, said: "For me to step down as Chancellor while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other serious challenges is a decision that I have not taken lightly."
"However, the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously. I recognize this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning."
Javid said many lawmakers and the public had lost confidence in Johnson's ability to govern in the national interest.
"I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership - and you have therefore lost my confidence too," Javid said in a letter to Johnson.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The future of Team USA, regardless of what happens in Mexico, remains a bit of an incomplete picture.  Morgan, who scored twice on Monday, and Megan Rapinoe both received their first call-ups to the squad since October for the Concacaf event.  But Morgan, 33, is already defending his position against rising stars like Catarino Macario, who is currently out with a knee injury.  And young forwards like Mallory Pugh, Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman all play in the same position as Rapinoe, who turned 37 on Tuesday.
“It’s not easy being a striker in the United States right now,” Andonovski said when he announced his Concacaf Championship roster.  “Obviously it’s great, but it’s not easy because the competition is getting bigger and bigger.
Similar battles are playing out on the pitch at every position, in every roster decision, as the United States go from a roster that has taken them to two consecutive World Cup titles to one that could take it to one. third against regional rivals like Canada, the reigning Olympic gold medalistand European contenders like Sweden, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and England – among others – who contest the European championship this month.
The Americans’ remaining group stage schedule includes matches against Jamaica (Thursday) and Mexico (Monday).  Canada leads Group B, which includes Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Panama.  The final will take place on July 18.
To achieve this, Andonovski will rely on a mix of experience, talent and generations at his disposal: of the 23 players in the American squad, seven are in their thirties but eight are 25 or younger.  And so far, he hasn’t made any promises to anyone.
“It doesn’t mean that all these players who have done well in the past are just going to come back here at the next camp because they did well a year or two years ago,” Andonovski said in February, when a the previous list also omitted several accomplished veterans.

Warzone/The Drive: Air Force’s First ‘New’ Constant Phoenix Nuke-Sniffing Jet Has Flown 
While far from new, the converted KC-135Rs will make up a fleet of three WC-135R nuke-sniffing jets that replace problem-plagued models. 
The first of what will become the U.S. Air Force’s fleet of three “nuke-sniffing” planes completed its pioneering flight test in Greenville, Texas this week. The KC-135R, with the serial number 64-14836, now converted into the WC-135R Constant Phoenix configuration, is scheduled to be delivered next month and will carry out operations that consist of collecting air samples to screen for the presence of notable nuclear materials. Beyond taking baseline readings around the globe, the Constant Phoenix jets can be deployed to monitor nuclear weapons tests and look for and track nuclear leaks and other nuclear incidents. In doing so, it can provide critical intelligence and help map and mitigate potential fallout.

Retired general starts fundraising effort to outfit volunteer Ukrainian fighters with equipment 
Retired Canadian Armed Forces general Rick Hillier believes Canada and other Western nations could be doing more to support Ukraine's effort to fight back against the Russian invasion. 
The conflict is stretching into four months with no real indictors of an end in sight. On Monday, Russian forces launched a missile attack on a busy shopping centre in the city of Kremenchuk. 
Hillier — a former chief of defence staff —  told CBC News Ukraine is in a struggle for its life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian state TV host Olga Skabeeva has in the past signaled that she wants to see former President Donald Trump back in the White House in 2024 -- but now she's apparently having second thoughts.
The Daily Beast's Julia Davis has posted new video showing Skabeeva taking a more critical eye toward Trump because he is apparently no longer so eager to heap slavish praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The other day, Trump promised to destroy the Russian Federation, to destroy Putin's hegemony, as he put it," she said. "Now we have to think whether to re-install him again as the American president! We haven't decided yet."
This is quite the tone shift from earlier in the year when Skabeeva openly called on Trump to run for president again and promised he would once again receive help from Russia's government, just as he did in 2016 when Russian spies hacked into the Democratic National Committee and leaked tranches of emails timed to deal damage to Hillary Clinton's campaign.

"Donald already declared that he will become the 47th president of America and will figure things out with Russia and Putin," she said this past January. "Donald, we're waiting for you and are ready to elect you again."
At the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine this past February, Trump praised Putin's military strategy as "genius" and "very savvy" despite the fact that it has led to tens of thousand Russian army casualties, a massive contraction of the Russian economy, and the expansion of NATO to Sweden and Finland.
Watch the video below or at this link.

\u201cMeanwhile on Russian state TV: annoyed by Trump reportedly promising to destroy the Russian Federation and Putin's hegemony, state TV host Olga Skabeeva said that Russia "will have to think whether to re-install him again as the American president. We haven't decided yet."\u201d

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Russia is set to switch off the gas for work on a key pipeline — and Germany fears the worst 
* Russia is poised to temporarily shut down the European Union’s single biggest piece of gas import infrastructure, stoking fears of a delayed or only partial return of gas supplies. 
* Some fear the Kremlin could use planned maintenance works to turn off the taps for good. 
* “If it doesn’t come back after maintenance because President Putin plays games or wants to hit Europe while it hurts, then the plan to fill up gas storage by the end of summer will probably not work,” said Eurasia Group’s Henning Gloystein. 
Russia is poised to temporarily shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline — the European Union’s biggest piece of gas import infrastructure — for annual maintenance. 
The works have stoked fears of further disruption to gas supplies that would undermine the bloc’s efforts to prepare for winter. 
Some fear the Kremlin could use planned maintenance works to turn off the taps for good. 
 The summer maintenance activities on the pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, are scheduled to take place from July 11 through to July 21.

A Russian colonel was accused of selling the locations of his own soldiers, an audio recording released by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate revealed. The recording is a man saying he is a Russian soldier and a female friend. The recording doesn't cite a specific place in Ukraine, but he was complaining of constant shelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[German police believe a home-made bomb could have caused an explosion at the offices of the hard-left Die Linke political party in western Germany, according to dpa sources.
Police in the city of Oberhausen found evidence of a home-made explosive device that was built using "flash explosives" like those contained in fireworks, the sources said.
An explosion at around 3:20 am (0120 GMT) destroyed the windows of the Die Linke party office. It also partially destroyed the interiors of the shops including a hairdressers and a travel agent.
Yusuf Karacelik, parliamentary group leader of the party in Oberhausen, said in a written statement on Tuesday that he assumed it was a "targeted attack from the right."
Speaking to dpa, Karacelik called it a "right-wing terrorist attack."
National party leader Janine Wissler also said she believed there could be a right-wing political motive behind the blast.
There are currently no indications of who carried out the suspected bombing. A police spokesperson said that they were investigating all possible leads and that a political motivation could not be ruled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to growing tension with Israel over its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has ordered the Jewish Agency to cease all operations in the country, The Jerusalem Post reports. 
The move could greatly undermine the ability of Russian Jews to immigrate to Israel, of which thousands have already secured the paperwork to do so, but the sanctions on Russia have caused most international airlines to stop flying to the country.
Sources in Russia's Jewish community told the Post that "people from the Jewish community have been feeling the Iron Curtain setting on them and they fear they won't be able to escape the country" and that "a number of Jews have said that the Russian authorities are trying to arrest them and that they fear for their lives."
The Jewish Agency works to facilitate aliyah from Jewish communities around the world. If the organization is blocked in Russia, it will be the first time in the past 30 years that aliyah efforts are banned in the country.

"I was updated this morning regarding the decision of the Russian Ministry of Justice. As is well known, the Jewish Agency is a central arm of the government and the ministry for the assistance of the immigration of Jews from all over the world to the State of Israel," Aliyah and Integration Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata said in response to the move. 
"We must ensure that their scope of operation is maintained as it has been throughout the years. I appealed to the Prime Minister to work with the Moscow administration to resolve the problem and I want to strengthen the Jewish community in Russia, which must be worried at this time about the consequences of the decision. Aliyah is a basic right for the Jews of Russia and we will make sure that it is preserved as such."]]></summary>

A sample of 750,000 entries posted online by the hacker showed citizens' names, mobile phone numbers, national ID numbers, addresses, birthdays and police reports they had filed.
AFP and cybersecurity experts have verified some of the citizen data in the sample as authentic, but the scope of the entire database is hard to determine.
Advertised on a forum late last month but only picked up by cybersecurity experts this week, the 23-terabyte database -- which the hacker claims contains the records of a billion Chinese citizens -- is being sold for 10 bitcoin (approximately $200,000).

Emergency services have now instructed about 50,000 people to evacuate or to prepare to escape the rising waters in New South Wales, officials said.
Emergency workers carried out 22 flood rescues in Sydney overnight, they said, with the support of 100 army troops deployed to the state.
The floods, heavy rain and powerful winds led to power cuts for 19,000 homes, officials said.
Australia has been at the sharp end of climate change, with droughts, deadly bushfires, bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef and floods becoming more common and intense as global weather patterns change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italy declared a state of emergency in five northern regions and announced emergency funds on Monday over a worsening drought that has plagued the Po Valley in recent weeks.
The cabinet approved a state of emergency in five regions—Friuli-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Piedmont and Veneto—until December 31, the government said in a statement that also announced a 36.5 million-euro ($39.5 million) fund to help those affected.
Italy is facing an unusually early heatwave and a lack of rainfall, particularly in the northern agricultural Po Valley, which has been hit by its worst drought in 70 years.
The state of emergency provides “extraordinary means and powers” to help guarantee public safety, compensation for losses while seeking to guarantee normal living conditions for those in the area.
According to the country’s largest agricultural union, Coldiretti, the drought threatens more than 30 percent of national agricultural production, and half of the farms in the Po Valley, where Parma ham is produced.
Lakes Maggiore and Garda were also hit by lower than normal water levels for this time of year, while further south the Tiber River, which runs through Rome, also dropped.
The Po represents the peninsula’s largest water reservoir, much of which is used by farmers.
In recent days, several municipalities have announced restrictions.

Verona, a city of a quarter of a million people, has rationed the use of drinking water, while Milan has announced the closure of its decorative fountains.
Another consequence of the drought is that hydroelectric power production has fallen sharply.
Hydroelectric plants, mostly in the mountainous north of the country, account for nearly 20 percent of national energy production.
The announcement comes a day after at least seven people died after a glacier collapsed in the Italian Alps which Prime Minister Mario Draghi said was “without doubt” linked to global warming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[California, which once updated its cumulative case and death counts every weekday, now does so only twice a week.  In Florida, case and death data are released only once every two weeks.  As recently as last week, many other public testing sites shut down Alaska, Colorado and Rhode Island;  Iowa is closing many sites by the end of next week.
Recent virus numbers have wobbled during holidays like Memorial Day and Juneteenth, during which many states often pause reporting and then restart tracking afterwards, a trend that is sure to continue this week. after the 4th of July holiday weekend.
“Tracking the daily test tally is less informative than it used to be,” Dr Adalja said, citing the strong link between cases and hospitalizations in the past.  Today’s numbers shouldn’t be treated like checking a sports team’s daily standings or scores, he added.
“I think testing plays a different role,” he said.  “Even when testing was at a different stage, it was always an underestimate.”
To get localized insight into the evolution of the virus, Dr Adjala said he had come to rely on hospitalizations as a percentage of his capacity.  It also checks the CDC community level monitoring, which includes new hospital admissions and the number of beds used.  He urges focusing on serious illnesses, rather than following “booms and busts of cases”.
Hospitalizations increased slightly throughout June, although they remain low.  Just over 33,000 people are in US hospitals with the coronavirus on average, and fewer than 4,000 are in intensive care.  Reports of new deaths remain below 400 a day, down from the country’s daily peak of more than 3,300 deaths in January 2021.

As the Kremlin presses ahead with its military intervention in the pro-Western country, more and more Russians are turning to astrologers.
In Russia's second city of Saint Petersburg, bespectacled Elena Korolyova receives clients in her apartment, where two cats prowl between piles of books.
"People want to know what will become of Russia, cut off from the rest of world," the 63-year-old told AFP.
Astrologers, psychics and mediums have for years been popular in Russia, and particularly turbulent years have seen demand for their services increase.
As the country reels from a barrage of unprecedented sanctions over Ukraine, more and more Russians are turning to astrology as they peer into the future.

This claim was unsupported by law or history, violating legal precedents, established practices in other states, and the clear intent and authority of Congress.

This week, Gorsuch got his answer: Yes, the court would wither and side with an aggressively political media campaign against the rule of law.  The tribes have once again seen another broken promise – despite our best hopes, the court sent a message that the word of the United States is meaningless when it c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The attack during the July 4 parade in Highland Park was the largest and most publicized shooting, but far from the only one, over the holiday weekend.
It was one of two mass shootings in the Chicago area alone on Monday.  Less than 12 hours earlier, five people were injured in a shooting in Chicago’s South End.
The Highland Park shooting was notable for its scale (at least three dozen injured), its fatality (at least six killed) and its location, an affluent suburb that doesn’t often see such violence.  But it was part of a pattern: the brutal pervasiveness of gun violence in a nation with more guns than people.


By early Monday morning, at least 57 people had been shot in Chicago over the July 4 weekend, nine of them fatally, according to NBC Chicago.  This did not include the toll from…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the United States grapples with the ongoing fallout from the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v.  Wade, a question lurks between court opinions and news reports: why are pregnancy risks so rarely discussed anywhere, even though this information is relevant not only to individual decisions, but also to policies regarding abortion, pregnancy and health care for women?
With the wave of abortion bans unfolding across US states, these risks are going to come into greater focus – figuring both in women’s decisions to risk getting pregnant if they live in a state that has banned abortions, and arguments that will occur in state legislative chambers about the degree of threat to a mother’s health that must be present to permit an abortion under untested and rapidly changing state laws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reason.com: The Army Thinks Printers Cost Over $1 Million 
Poor accounting practices mean the Department of Defense can't even tell how much money or equipment it has lost. 
The Army failed to properly account for tens of millions of dollars' worth of equipment, according to the Department of Defense's (DOD) internal watchdog. 
A report released last week by the DOD Office of the Inspector General detailed the results of a recent audit of military bases in Kuwait. Specifically, the audit intended "to determine whether the Army effectively accounted for Government-furnished property (GFP)." 
The audit focused on two bases, Camp Arifjan and Camp Buehring. In 2010, a contractor (not named in the report) was awarded a $75 million contract to provide operations and security support to both bases, including "food and housing, payroll support, fire protection, security protection, law enforcement, and transportation." The contract was extended multiple times, totaling more than $5 billion over more than a decade.

Insider: Germany's second-largest city is preparing to ration hot water as the Russia energy crisis escalates 
* Hamburg's environment senator said the city could set limits on when people can use hot water. 
* Jens Kerstan told Welt am Sonntag that this could happened in the case of an "acute gas shortage." 
* Germany is scrambling to plug the gap in energy supplies after cutting its dependence on Russian gas. 
Hamburg, the largest non-capital city in the European Union, has warned that it could ration be forced to hot water as the Russian energy crisis causes chaos. 
Jens Kerstan, environment senator for Germany's second biggest city, told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag on Saturday that Hamburg could restrict availability of hot water to certain times of days "in an acute gas shortage." 
"We are in a much worse crisis than most people realize," Kerstan said in a separate interview with the Hamburger Abendblatt on Sunday. 
He urged people to take shorter showers, avoid full baths, and install modern thermostats and water-saving shower heads.

   Washington Examiner: White House Report Card: Zogby says Biden ‘in real trouble’ 
This week’s White House Report Card finds President Joe Biden ending another horror week, whipped repeatedly by the Supreme Court and approval polls and facing a growing fall election disaster if he doesn’t pull up soon. 
Democratic pollster and grader John Zogby, who likes the president, gave another subpar grade to Biden and warned of rocky shores ahead. 
“The president is in real trouble,” Zogby said in grading a “D.” And he added that approval polls of Biden and his handling of the economy are “showing real dangers for him among Democratic bastions as well as independents.”

WNU Editor: Zogby is not the only pollster giving a heads-up on what is the public support for President Biden (see below): 

"President Biden has blamed major oil companies and Russian President Putin for higher fuel prices. Critics say Biden’s energy policies are mainly to blame. Who bears most responsibility for higher fuel prices?"
26% Big Oil
15% Putin
51% Biden
8% Not Surehttps://t.co/24DWMNhds2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Campaigners in Northern Ireland are closely watching US moves to restrict abortion, particularly concerns that women will now have to travel across states for terminations.
Abortion was only decriminalized in the British province in 2019 -- 42 years after terminations were made legal up to 24 weeks in most circumstances in the rest of the UK.
But despite legislation, lack of government funding and political wrangling have meant women are still having to travel to the British mainland for abortions.
Currently, there are still no surgical abortion services available in Northern Ireland and no options for abortion after 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Last year, 161 women crossed the Irish Sea to England and Wales for an abortion, according to UK government statistics published last month.

Ticket sales had to be temporarily suspended twice on opening day to avoid overcrowding inside the Tainan Art Museum on the island's south-western coast, with thousands waiting in line for a chance to see the gory display.
The show features traditional artifacts, artworks and pop culture about the afterlife in different Asian cultures, with much of the display borrowed from a French museum.
The main attraction is three life-size depictions of Chinese hopping vampires -- reanimated corpses whose stiffened limbs mean they can only move by bouncing along -- with visitors lining up …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tropical Storm Bonnie was upgraded to a category one hurricane on Sunday as it swept towards Mexico after killing three people in El Salvador and Nicaragua, the US National Hurricane Center said.
The hurricane, the third of the season off Mexico's coast, is carrying maximum sustained winds of 80 miles (125 kilometers) per hour "with higher gusts," the NHC said, citing satellite images.
"The core of Bonnie is expected to remain south of, but move parallel to, the coast of southern and southwestern Mexico during the next couple of days," the center said in its latest advisory.
Before moving towards Mexico, the storm caused damage to property in the Central American countries of El Salvador and Nicaragua, felling trees and flooding rivers, streets and hospitals.
A 24-year-old woman died in El Salvador, emergency services said, while in Nicaragua the army said a 40-year-old man was swept away trying to cross a river and a 38-year-old man died trying to rescue passengers from a bus.
Rescuers in El Salvador were still searching Sunday evening for a missing man and the search efforts will continue on Monday, the country's civil protection agency said.
"Bonnie generated very heavy rains and thunderstorms in the coastal area, the volcanic mountain range and the San Salvador metropolitan area, with strong gusty winds and hail in some areas," the environment ministry said.
El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said all classes would be suspended Monday.
Bonnie, which made landfall in Nicaragua overnight Friday to Saturday, is set to drench southern Mexico with heavy rain, the NHC said.
Swells caused by the hurricane are to "cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," its advisory said.

Danish police said Monday that the suspect in a weekend shooting at a Copenhagen mall that left three dead, including two teenagers, was known to mental health services.
"Our suspect is also known among psychiatric services, beyond that I do not wish to comment," Copenhagen police chief Soren Thomassen told a press conference.
Thomassen added that the victims appeared to have been randomly targeted and there was nothing to indicate it was an act of terror.

Russia has intensified its restrictions on independent media since attacking its neighbor in February, with journalists under threat of prosecution for criticizing the invasion or for even referring to it as a war.
The US government-backed Open Technology Fund is paying out money to a handful of American firms providing virtual private networks (VPNs) free of charge to millions of Russians, who can then use them to visit websites blocked by censors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]  Twenty-five years since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, The Hong Kong Jockey Club has remained committed to giving back to society and promoting community development. Not only does the Club support charities, but it also organises a wide range of fun activities for children and the young at heart, the latest of which is the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour.   Inspired by the ancient Chinese mythical animal ‘Dragon Horse’, Drago Cavallo is a contemporary expression of Chinese culture and a symbol of inspiration, which will lead a trail of positivity around Hong Kong. The adorable creature is designed by renowned artist Simon Ma.    On July 3, Club Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, Simon Ma, Po Leung Kuk Chairman Dr Daniel Chan, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Chairman Philip Ma and the talented students whose artwork adorns the special anniversary Drago Cavallo sculptures, took part in the opening ceremony of the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour in Tai Kwun.     The exhibition showcases 43 exhibits from the Drago Cavallo collection until July 10. Visitors can also experience the AR scavenger hunt and other immersive digital experiences on the spot. The roving exhibition will then be held in the East Coast Park Precinct, Sha Tin Town Hall Plaza, the Hong Kong Museum of Art and other surprising locations until November.     “Drago Cavallo is a wonderful initiative for our younger generation, providing them with a platform to express themselves and showcase their creativity. I would like to thank Simon Ma for initiating this meaningful programme and all partners for their collaboration. Creativity is key to innovation, and innovation is vital to maintaining Hong Kong’s competitive edge. This is why continuous development is one of the Club’s core values,” said Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges.   “This art showcase is just one of many programmes the Club is proud to support through its ‘With You. Now. Always.’…]]></summary>

Ukraine on Sunday said the tactical withdrawal would save the lives of its soldiers who would regroup, to launch a counter offensive with the help of long-range Western weapons. But Moscow said the capture of Lysychansk less than a week after taking neighbouring Sievierdonetsk meant it had "liberated" Luhansk. It ...]]></summary>

VOA/Reuters: Minister: Sri Lanka Struggling to Pay for Fuel Shipments  
Colombo — Sri Lanka is struggling to raise $587 million to pay for about half a dozen fuel shipments, a top minister said Sunday as the cash-strapped country tries to cope with its worst financial crisis in decades. 
The country of 22 million people is unable to pay for essential imports of food items, fertilizer, medicines and fuel — due to a severe dollar crunch. 
Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said new fuel shipments were being lined up, but the country is struggling to raise enough funds to pay as the central bank can supply only about $125 million. 
Sri Lanka only has 12,774 tons of diesel and 4,061 tons of petrol left in its government reserves, he told reporters in Colombo, the commercial center of the island nation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good look at USS Green Bay's flight deck. Via Seaforces.org 
Daily Mail: Disturbing new footage shows moment US Osprey helicopter crashed into USS Green Bay in 2017, killing three young Marines after suffering fatal technical issue 
* Footage released this weekend showed the horrific August 2017 Osprey smash that killed three Marines 
* It was completing a day of practice missions in Australia when it struck the deck of the USS Green Bay and plunged 30 feet into the Pacific 
* The chopper's co-pilot, 1st Lt. Benjamin Cross, died in the subsequent crash, as did Pfc Ruben Velasco, 19, and Cpl Nathaniel Ordway, 26 
* Another 23 Marines who were on board the chopper at the time of the smash were rescued 
* A subsequent investigation cleared Cross and his unnamed co-pilot of any wrongdoing, and said technical issues had caused the crash 
* Last month, five decorated Marines were killed in an Osprey crash in California, with some branding the accident-plagued choppers flying death-traps 
Newly-unearthed footage shows the moment a MV-22 Osprey helicopter crashed over the side of a US warship in 2017, killing three Marines who were on board. 
The clip, first posted online Saturday, shows the sophisticated helicopter - which can fly like a plane and hover like a chopper -  trying to land on the deck of the US Green Bay of the coast of Queensland, Australia, on August 5, 2017. 
But the chopper - which has been plagued by fatal accidents that have killed 51 service personnel since its first flight in 1989 - suddenly drops unexpectedly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: JPMorgan Sees ‘Stratospheric’ $380 Oil on Worst-Case Russian Cut 
(Bloomberg) -- Global oil prices could reach a “stratospheric” $380 a barrel if US and European penalties prompt Russia to inflict retaliatory crude-output cuts, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts warned. 
The Group of Seven nations are hammering out a complicated mechanism to cap the price fetched by Russian oil in a bid to tighten the screws on Vladimir Putin’s war machine in Ukraine. 
But given Moscow’s robust fiscal position, the nation can afford to slash daily crude production by 5 million barrels without excessively damaging the economy, JPMorgan analysts including Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note to clients. 
 For much of the rest of the world, however, the results could be disastrous. 
A 3 million-barrel cut to daily supplies would push benchmark London crude prices to $190, while the worst-case scenario of 5 million could mean “stratospheric” $380 crude, the analysts wrote.

Fortune: ‘From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU’: Lavrov says a new Iron Curtain is coming down between Russia and the West 
Back to the Cold War it is, then.  A new Iron Curtain is descending between Russia and the West, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday. 
“From now on, we will trust neither the Americans nor the EU,” Lavrov said at a press conference after talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Vladimir Makei. 
“We will do everything necessary not to depend on them in critically important industries.”  Lavrov was concurring with comments made by Makei, regarding the appearance of a new Iron Curtain that was “being erected by Westerners themselves.” In echoing the Belarusian diplomat, Lavrov warned Western countries to “behave carefully.”

* Filip Voskresenski told journalists he was among the 70 Russian diplomatic staff declared “persona non grata” and ordered to leave the country before Monday. 
* Bulgaria’s expulsion decision was announced by acting Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, who took a strong stance against Russia after it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNN: Belarus claims to have shot down Ukrainian missiles  
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has accused Ukraine of firing missiles at military facilities on his country’s territory. 
He said the missiles were intercepted by Belarusian air defense systems earlier this week. 
Without providing any evidence of the alleged attack, Lukashenko – a close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin – called the act a “provocation”. 
“Thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Lukashenko said in comments that appeared on his presidential website on Saturday and were also published by state-run news agency Belta. 
He added that there were no soldiers from Belarus currently fighting in Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on Lukashenko’s claims.
