CNN: China’s Xi acknowledges Covid frustration caused protests and hints at relaxing rules, EU official says

Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel in Beijing on Thursday that the protesters were “mainly students” who were frustrated after three years of Covid, and hinted at the potential relaxation of China’s prevention measures, an EU official told CNN Friday. 
“Xi also said Omicron is less deadly than Delta, which makes the Chinese government feel more open to further relaxing Covid restrictions,” the EU official said.

Reuters: Japan, Britain and Italy to announce joint fighter project as early as next week - sources 
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan, Britain and Italy will announce a groundbreaking agreement as early as next week to jointly develop a new advanced jet fighter, two sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters. 
For Tokyo and London it represents the culmination of ever closer defence ties, which in turn give Britain a bigger security role in Asia and provide Japan with new security partners that can help it counter neighbouring China's growing military power. 
The push to merge the British led Tempest jet fighter project with Japan's F-X fighter programme was first reported by Reuters in July. It will be the first time that Japan has collaborated with countries beyond the United States on a major defence equipment project.

The president’s statements on talks with Russia aren’t that different from his previous positions.
 President Joe Biden’s comments on Thursday that he’d be open to diplomacy with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the war in Ukraine may have been more about signaling Western solidarity and shoring up the US’s relationship with France than about entering into an imminent dialogue with Russia.
Biden made the remarks during an official state visit from French President Emmanuel Macron, whose decision to try and engage Putin in talks during the course of the invasion has been met with little success, as well as some frustration with from allies like the US. 
National Security Agency spokesperson John Kirby clarified Biden’s comments in a press brief…]]></summary>

Moldova relies heavily on Russia and Ukraine for energy and has been badly hit by the invasion of its neighbor.
In this interview, Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita explains the challenges faced by her country.  Natalia Gavrilita: First of all, the attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. These attacks have already caused two nationwide power cuts, one on November 15, 2022, and one a week ago. Today, we heard about new potential attacks, including ones targeting the nearby region of Odesa.
I think that the greatest threats we face relate to energy security — among other things — because of the supply line via Ukraine as we don't have any high-voltage transmission lines that can be connected to the Romanian grid. We are working on this and hope to have a joint high-voltage transmission line in 2024. Until then, we remain very vulnerable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: The AP raises a good question, but does not give an answer .... EXPLAINER: Can Ukraine pay for war without wrecking economy? (AP). 
This AP article outlines what Kyiv and its allies are doing, but it is obvious that without Western aid Ukraine's financial house of cards will collapse. 
I know this to be true from my own personal case. All of my relatives in Ukraine are now dependent on me for a remittance to survive. And they are the lucky ones. 
The official inflation rate is around 25%, but they tell me that for the basics like food and fuel prices have more than doubled. 
Before the war Ukraine was already having problems paying the loans and debts that it has accumulated since 2014. Ukraine is certainly not going to be able to pay-off the debt that it has accumulated since the start of the war, and it certainly does not have the resources to rebuild the country when the war is over. 
What is also ominous is that all of Ukraine's youth know this. Even if the war should end today, they have no desire to stay in a broken country that will take generations of hardship to pay-off its debts and rebuild the country. Everyone under 30 that I know in Ukraine have either left the country, or will (in the case of the men) when the conflict is over.]]></summary>

Euronews: Russian Foreign Minister accused US, NATO of direct involvement in Ukraine war 
Russia’s foreign minister on Thursday accused the West of becoming directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine by supplying it with weapons and training its soldiers. 
Sergei Lavrov also said that Russia’s strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other key infrastructure that have left millions without power, heating and water were intended to weaken Ukraine’s military potential and derail the shipments of Western weapons.
“You shouldn't say that the US and NATO aren’t taking part in this war, you are directly participating in it,” Lavrov said in a video call with reporters.

WNU Editor: The Russian public knows that they are in an undeclared war against NATO. I know that NATO and Russia are now in an undeclared war. Most readers of this blog also know that both sides are now in an undeclared war. 
But do most Europeans feel this way? Do most Canadians and North Americans feel this way? 
I cannot speak for Europe, but I know that in Canada and the U.S. the public is clueless on what is happening.

* Journalist Matt Taibbi Friday began publishing the internal Twitter documents 
* They showed the shocking political influence on content moderation at the site 
* Taibbi conducted his probe with the cooperation of new Twitter chief Elon Musk 
* Emails showed staffers censoring tweets at the behest of the Joe Biden's team 
* His campaign made requests for tweets to be taken down - and Twitter complied 
Files showing Twitter's suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal were released on the social media giant today thanks to Elon Musk. 
The documents include internal Twitter emails appearing to show staffers censoring tweets at the behest of the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign. 
Weeks ahead of the election in October 2020, Twitter prevented sharing of a story about Hunter's involvement with a Chinese oil giant – and his then-presidential candidate father Joe Biden's potential slice of a multi-million-dollar deal with the foreign firm.

Update: Elon Musk Releases THE TWITTER FILES: How Twitter Collaborated With "The Biden Team" To Cover Up The Hunter Laptop Story (Zero Hedge)   
WNU Editor: The above Daily Mail article does a good summary on what has been disclosed by journalist Matt Taibbi. 

Matt Taibbi began publishing the internal Twitter documents on his Twitter page today. You can read the full conversation on Twitter below. 
It is clear to me that the staff at Twitter probably never thought that these internal discussions would be made public. They must be really pissed. On another note. You know that this type of political bias, influence and censorship is even worse at Facebook and Google/YouTube.

NYPost: Putin fell down stairs, soiled himself as speculation over worsening health grows: report  
Russian President Vladimir Putin fell down the stairs and soiled himself this week amid mounting speculation that his health is declining, an anti-Kremlin Telegram channel with apparent links to his security team reported. 
Putin, 70, suffered the unfortunate fall at his Moscow official residence on Wednesday evening, according to the Telegram channel “General SVR,” which purports to be run by a former Russian spy. 
The ailing Russian leader allegedly fell down five steps before landing on his coccyx, or tailbone.   Although his security guards immediately rushed to his aid, the impact of the fall caused Putin to “involuntarily defecate” due to “cancer affecting his stomach and bowels,” according to the channel.

Update: ‘Critically ill’ Putin falls down stairs and ‘soils himself’ while plagued with cancer, claims Kremlin ‘insider’ (The SUN)   
WNU Editor: I have lost count over the years on how many reports I have read that Putin is sick. Putin is dying. Putin has incurable diseases. Etc.. 
I an sure Russian President Putin is going to die one day. But he looked good yesterday (see above picture from Reuters).]]></summary>

DW: Germany, Norway seek NATO role in undersea infrastructure 
The leaders of Germany and Norway have said they will propose that NATO plays a role in protecting undersea infrastructure like gas pipelines or fiber optic cables. This follows the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said on Wednesday that they would be speaking with the head of NATO about involving the alliance in future operations to protect critical undersea infrastructure like gas pipelines or fiber optic cables.  
Store said Norway had already increased vigilance at such sites in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and even more so after the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. 
Store was visiting the German capital on Wednesday for bilateral talks and to attend the Berlin Security Conference with Scholz.

WNU Editor: Germany has stated that they know who was responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline attacks. But they will not release that information due to national security. 
I think it would be helpful if we do know who was responsible for those attacks. To make that information and evidence public so we will know who are we defending our infrastructure against, and why billions must be spent to do so.

A record $51.5 billion is needed to help 230 million of the world’s most vulnerable people in nearly 70 countries next year, the UN said on Thursday.  
The size of the appeal – 25 per cent higher than this year’s - reflects the fact that the total number in need is 65 million more than in 2022, the UN and partner organizations noted. 
In a video message, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that during a "year of extremes", it was essential to fund lifesaving operations next year, which were a "source of hope for millions of people in desperate need."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To justify the invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin used the false pretexts of "denazification" and "demilitarisation" of the country.

* Biden said he was open to meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin  
* But he said it must be with NATO allies and Putin must want to end war in Ukraine 
* 'I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, (to) find out what he's willing to do,' Biden said during his joint press conference at White House 
President Joe Biden on Thursday said he was open to meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin but put several caveats on such a sit down. 
Biden said the meeting would have to be with NATO allies and that Putin needs to be ready to talk about how to end his invasion of the Ukraine. 
The president, speaking at a joint news conference at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron, said he would choose his words carefully when he was asked about meeting with the Russian president.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is "open to negotiations" on Ukraine but the West must accept Moscow's demands, the Kremlin says, a day after US President Joe Biden said he was willing to talk with the Russian leader. 
Speaking after talks on Thursday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Biden said he was ready to speak with Mr Putin "if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war", adding the Russian leader "hasn't done that yet". 
Mr Biden has not spoken directly with Mr Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

BBC: Ukraine war: Kyiv displays dummy nuclear-capable missile fired by Russia 
Russia is now using nuclear-capable missiles with non-explosive warheads to exhaust Ukraine's air defences, the Ukrainian military has said. 
It displayed what it said were fragments of Soviet-made X-55 cruise missiles - designed for nuclear use - found in Ukraine's two western regions. 
The rockets are being launched to "exhaust the air-defence system of our country," a Ukrainian official said. 
He said tests on the fragments did not show abnormal levels of radioactivity. 
Ukrainian military experts say Russia may have significantly depleted its vast missile arsenal after carrying out wave after wave of massive strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure in recent weeks. 
Moscow is now resorting to using blunt projectiles that still cause devastation, they say. A UK intelligence report in November came to similar conclusions.

Update #2: Russia's use of Soviet-made missiles aimed at distracting air defenses - General Staff (Ukrinform)   
WNU Editor: Pentagon officials reported the same thing a few days .... Russia firing unarmed missiles to deplete Ukraine air defense, says U.S. military official (Reuters). 
I know Russia has thousands of these old missiles. They are not running out of missiles as this report is claiming .... Putin fires cruise missiles with dummy nuclear warheads at Ukraine because their missile stocks are so depleted, UK government says (Daily Mail).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Independent: Biden willing to discuss end to Ukraine war with Putin but says Russian victory is ‘beyond comprehension’ 
President Joe Biden on Thursday said he would be willing to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin to learn whether he’s willing to end his nearly year-long invasion of Ukraine, but not unilaterally and only after discussions with America’s Nato allies first. 
Speaking at a news conference alongside French president Emmanuel Macron after a three-hour bilateral meeting between the two leaders and their respective advisers, Mr Biden said he’d take a meeting with Mr Putin “if he’s willing to talk to find out what he’s willing to do”. 
“But I’ll only do it in consultation with my Nato allies. I’m not going to do it on my own,” he added.

Update #2: Biden has 'no immediate plans to contact' Putin, will only speak if he is 'looking for a way to end the war' (FOX News)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Spain letter bombs: Spanish PM targeted amid spate of explosive packages 
Spain has stepped up security after revealing a number of letter bombs have been sent to high-profile targets, including the prime minister. 
On Wednesday, an employee of the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid was lightly injured when a similar device exploded. 
Officials say the defence minister was among the other targets. Another device was also sent to the US embassy. 
It is thought the bombs could be linked to Spain's support for Ukraine, but no-one has yet claimed to have sent them.  Russia - which invaded Ukraine in February - has condemned any "terrorist" activity, saying such threats or acts were "totally reprehensible".

It would take a minimum of one week for Russia to pull out of Kherson city, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Russia still had 40,000 troops in the region and intelligence showed its forces remained in a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Taliban have banned Afghan women from entering the capital's public parks and funfairs, just months after ordering access to be segregated by gender.
The new rule, introduced this week, further squeezes women out of an ever-shrinking public space that already sees them banned from traveling without a male escort and forced to wear a hijab or burqa whenever out of the home. 
Schools for teenage girls have also been shut for over a year across most of the country.
"For the past 15 months, we tried our best to arrange and sort it out -- and even specified the days," said Mohammad Akif Sadeq Mohajir, spokesman for the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue.
"But still, in some places -- in fact, we must say in many places -- the rules were violated," he told AFP late W…]]></summary>

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

The commander had proposed the "difficult decision" of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.

Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran's border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.
The crackdown on nationwide protests since her death has killed at least 304 people, including 41 children and 24 women, according to a combined toll issued…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Moscow (AFP) - Russia is moving US basketball star Brittney Griner to a penal colony after she lost an appeal against a drug conviction, her lawyers said Wednesday, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.
Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.
She "is now on her way to a penal colony," lawyers Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov said in a statement.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters it was too early to talk about a dialogue with the United States on extending the New START nuclear arms treaty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
