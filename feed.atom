Vladimir Putin wants the restoration of the USSR, and people are only expendable material for him, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with famous French actor Alain Delon, shown on the air of the telethon. 
"He [Putin] understands perfectly well what he is doing. He knows how many people are dying. But for him this is an integral part of the plan," Zelensky said. 
At the same time, he believes that Putin has made the majority of the nation believe in what he is doing. 
"There are social networks. We understand how people react. Many have been brainwashed by the information war, dirty information. Many have gone crazy and rejoice when they kill us. It looks scary," Zelensky said.

WNU Editor: Unfortunately you have to click on the above video to go to Youtube to watch it. It is also in French, and there is no close-captions or translation. 
Fortunately I speak French, and while it is a repeat of what he has been saying for the past few weeks, Zelensky did mention 2 important points. One .... he was "shocked" at Israel’s lack of support, and (2) he remarked that Ukraine is losing 50 soldiers a day. 
This is a hard to believe number, especially when Zelensky himself admitted a few months ago that Ukraine was losing 60 - 100 soldiers a day .... President Zelensky Says 60-100 Ukrainian Soldiers Are Being Killed Per Day And Around 500 Wounded (June 1, 2022), and his top aid admitted losses between 100 - 200 soldiers a day .... Senior Aide to President Zelensky Says Ukraine Is Losing 100 - 200 Soldiers Each Day (June 10, 2-22). My sources in Ukraine tell me that the number runs in the hundreds per day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ABC News Australia: Long queues form at Russia's borders as Putin's military mobilisation order prompts men to flee 
Some Russian men have rushed to leave the country after President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation, with traffic at border crossings with Finland and Georgia surging and prices for plane tickets from Moscow skyrocketing. 
Mr Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia's first mobilisation since World War II and backed a plan to annex swathes of Ukraine, warning the West he was not bluffing when he said he would be ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory. 
Prices for flights out of Moscow soared above $US5,000 ($7,000) for one-way tickets to the nearest foreign locations, with most air tickets sold out completely for coming days.

WNU Editor:  There is some exaggeration .... Debunked: Russians were not in a 35km queue at Finland border  (Euronews), but there is no question in my mind that with this mobilization many Russian males now want to be outside of Russia until this is all over.

A US aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea for a joint naval exercise, the first time since 2017. Separately, the South Korean president was caught on a hot mic insulting the US, which his office denied. 
The nuclear-powered USS Ronald Reagan reached the port of Busan on Friday as the two countries prepare for a drill aimed at showing strength in the face of rising threats from North Korea.

A B-2 Spirit has been ferried to Plant 42 in California for restoration a year after it ended up wing-down in the dirt.

Today, the aircraft flew to Plant 42 after receiving temporary repairs at Whiteman, and will now undergo a more substantial restoration so that it can return to the fleet. The War Zone was the first to report on the initial mishap, which took place on September 14, 2021, and publish satellite imagery showing the bomber lying on the grass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On February 1, 2021, the Burmese army retook power, brutally ending a decades-long period of democracy.

A shadow government was quickly formed, but armed resistance also got organised in a country cut off from the world. In this exclusive report shot in the rebel maquis and underground pro-democracy resistance circles, FRANCE 24 brings you an inside look at Myanmar’s civil war. Exiled dissidents, rebel military leaders and deserters from the Burmese army speak out and denounce in particular the growing and decisive Russian support for the junta.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian Oil tanker makes a delivery to Shell Refinery Spring 2011 by joecabby2011 used under CC BY-SA 2.0 
OilPrice.com: Russia’s Oil Exports Are Set To Plunge Next Year 
* Russia’s oil exports have been resilient since it invaded Ukraine, falling just 400,000 bpd below pre-war levels despite international sanctions. 
* The EU's embargo on crude oil this December and its embargo on oil products in February will displace 2.4 million bpd of oil. 
* While Russia may be able to find buyers for roughly half of that supply, it seems inevitable that its exports will fall dramatically. 
Nearly seven months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil exports have been quite resilient and just 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) below pre-war levels. 
But come December, Russian oil supply could plunge by more than one million bpd after the EU embargo on Russian oil imports by sea enters into force. 
In February, another one million bpd could then come offline due to the EU’s fuel embargo.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The West will need to find alternative oil suppliers, and Russia will need to find new customers. I predict both will succeed, but the disruption in supply chains will only mean higher prices for consumers. 
The only respite that we may have when it comes to oil prices is if the global recession deepens. And in that case it will only mean one thing. We are all suffering.]]></summary>

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, there has been a whopping $15.8 billion “in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden Administration, including more than $15.1 billion since the beginning of Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion on February 24.”

The U.S. Air Force will roll out its new B-21 stealth bomber the first week of December, the service's top weapons buyer said Tuesday. 
Andrew Hunter, the assistant Air Force secretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, gave no more details, not even a location for the rollout, which is expected to mark the first public view of the aircraft, which has been developed in near-total secrecy. 
He spoke Tuesday at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Air, Space & Cyber conference outside Washington, D.C.  Northrop Grumman is building the B-21 at a factory in Palmdale, California. The aircraft is expected to make its first flight in 2023.

Washington Post: U.S. has sent private warnings to Russia against using a nuclear weapon 
The United States for several months has been sending private communications to Moscow warning Russia’s leadership of the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nuclear weapon, according to U.S. officials, who said the messages underscore what President Biden and his aides have articulated publicly. 
The Biden administration generally has decided to keep warnings about the consequences of a nuclear strike deliberately vague, so the Kremlin worries about how Washington might respond, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations. 
The attempt by the White House to cultivate what’s known in the nuclear deterrence world as “strategic ambiguity” comes as Russia continues to escalate its rhetoric about possible nuclear weapons use amid a domestic mobilization aimed at stanching Russian military losses in eastern Ukraine.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia will on Friday begin its plan to annex around 15% of Ukrainian territory via referendums in four regions controlled by Russian forces, a move the West says is a gross violation of international law that significantly escalates the war. 
After nearly seven months of war, and a critical battlefield defeat in northeastern Ukraine earlier this month, President Vladimir Putin explicitly backed the referendums after the Russian-controlled regions lined up to ask for swift votes to join Russia. 
The self-styled Donetsk (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republics (LPR), which Putin recognised as independent just before the invasion, and Russian-installed administrations in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will hold votes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hill: Trump responds to Putin’s warning that nuclear threat ‘not a bluff’ Former President Trump responded Wednesday to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hinting at being willing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, saying that the conflict should never have happened and that it could lead to a world war. 
Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that the conflict would not have come to pass if he were still in the Oval Office.   “But as I have made very clear for quite some time, this could now end up being World War III,” he said.

Update #1: Trump says Ukraine war wouldn’t have happened if he were president and boasts he could end it (The Independent)  
Update #2: Trump issues World War III warning (RT)   
WNU Editor: Would Trump have made a difference if he was still President? I do not know. 
But I do know that it has been 20 months since Biden assumed the Office of the President, and since the fall of Afghanistan last year there is now a perception in the Western world that everything is rapidly descending into political/social/and economic chaos. 
What also does not help is that it appears the US President is not in control of his own faculties. Another "brain fog" incident happened again yesterday (see below):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  Hong Kong’s leading convenience store chain 7-Eleven renews its collaboration with Pei Ho Counterparts to provide free meals to the less privileged groups most impacted in these testing times  Serving Hong Kong for more than four decades, 7-Eleven has become one of the most recognised retailers across the city’s neighbourhoods. It offers round-the-clock conveniences to the population and pledges to play an active, good corporate citizen role by helping those in need.  Since 2017, for example, the franchise has supported Pei Ho Counterparts, a social enterprise associated with distributing free meals to the underprivileged in some of Hong Kong’s neediest districts. To date, 7-Eleven has donated a total of 250,000 free meal boxes, water, and goodie bags to the conscientious social enterprise, benefitting groups such as the homeless, the elderly, and struggling families.  Recently, 7-Eleven announced its continued collaboration with Pei Ho Counterparts in a new Sik Tak Fan La campaign. Literally, “the meal is ready” in Cantonese, the new campaign aims to raise HK$2 million for the social enterprise. The sum will support the organisation’s work in providing free meals and supplies for the less privileged communities most in need on a more regular basis.  Mobilising 7-Eleven network and resources  By making the most of its robust, 1000-plus store network, 7-Eleven is well positioned to create a synergetic effect within individual neighbourhoods. The company’s network makes a compelling case for engaging the broader community in support of the campaign that is for a good cause.   “As part of the Hong Kong community and as an organisation that prioritises corporate social responsibility, we are committed to contributing to society,” said Choo Peng-chee, chief executive officer of DFI Retail North Asia, the operator of Hong Kong’s leading convenience store chain.   “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe impact,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Libertarian Institute: Polls: Americans Oppose Increasing Ukraine Aid, Defending Global Democracy 
Two new polls from Morning Consult and Concerned Veterans for America show at least a plurality of Americans are tired of interventionism. The results show twice as many Americans want to send less aid to Ukraine than those who would support sending more. Meanwhile, only 17% of Americans are concerned about defending democracy around the globe. 
The Joe Biden White House built its foreign policy around the idea it would move away from fighting wars against terrorists in the Middle East, and refocus the Department of Defense on “Great Power Competition.” The administration marketed the policy as “autocracy versus democracy” with the White House leading the Western countries against Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and other ostensibly bad countries.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised by these poll numbers. Running an empire is an expensive business, and most Americans are getting tired of the cost in both treasure and blood.

Daily Mail: US Air Force Academy in Colorado is blasted for holding woke 'diversity and inclusion' summit that saw cadets ordered to ditch 'gendered' language including mom, dad, boyfriend and girlfriend 
* A recent training seminar at the US Air Force Academy aimed to teach cadets about diversity and inclusion 
* The presentation included messages recommending that gendered terms be kicked to the curb 
* 'Colorblind' and 'I don't see color' were also recommended to be abandoned 

 * Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida has called the teachings 'destructive' 
The US Air Force Academy is under fire for holding diversity and inclusion training that urges cadets to use non-gendered language, scrapping words like 'mom,' and 'dad', as well as 'girlfriend' and 'boyfriend.' 
According to screenshots from the seminar, obtained by FOX News Digital, Air Force training officials are asking recruits to use generic terms like 'partner' instead of 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend,' and 'parent' or 'parents' instead of 'mom' and 'dad.' 
The slides shared by FOX News prompted outrage from many across the country, including Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL).

Bloomberg: Turkey Shocks With Another Rate Cut Despite Raging Inflation 
(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank delivered another shock cut to interest rates, despite inflation running at a 24-year high and with the lira trading at a record low. 
The Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Sahap Kavcioglu lowered the benchmark to 12% from 13% on Thursday, surprising most economists surveyed by Bloomberg. 
The lira extended declines after the announcement and was trading 0.2% weaker against the dollar as of 3:02 p.m. in Istanbul. 
Turkey is charting an economic strategy in defiance of mainstream monetary policy. It’s already been an outlier for much of this year, as the world’s central bankers unleashed the most aggressive tightening in decades, and stood out even more this week as countries like Indonesia and Brazil raised rates.

The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 0.75% on Wednesday, making an aggressive move to tame inflation that could have other side effects — including a possible recession. 
The rate increase could also explode federal deficits even further in the years ahead.  A new analysis from the budget hawks at The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) predicts this week’s rate hike alone will add $2.1 trillion to government deficits over the next decade. 
That’s on top of a series of hikes we’ve already seen this year that are already set to add trillions more to the deficit in coming years. The central bank concluded its two-day policy meeting Wednesday by suggesting it could hike rates further in the months ahead.

Update #1: Another jumbo Fed rate hike poised to add $2.1T to national debt, CRFB says (FOX News)  
Update #2: Expected Interest Rate Hike Will Add $2 Trillion to the Deficit (Reason)   
WNU editor: The biggest loser with this interest rate increase is the US Federal Government. With $31 trillion in debt, every 1% increase in the Fed rate adds $300 billion in interest costs. 
So far in fiscal 2022, where interest have been low for the most part, the US Treasury has already spent $471 billion to just pay-off the government's interest payments.

A suspect has been taken into custody after the Washington Monument was vandalized with a splash of red paint and a lewd message on Tuesday night. 
The United States Park Police in Washington DC confirmed they had detained a male individual suspected of the vandalism.

Maplecroft:  101 countries witness rise in civil unrest in last quarter  
Worst yet to come as socioeconomic pressure builds 
The world is facing an unprecedented rise in civil unrest as governments of all stripes grapple with the impacts of inflation on the price of staple foods and energy, according to the latest edition of our Civil Unrest Index (CUI). The data, covering seven years, shows that the last quarter saw more countries witness an increase in risks from civil unrest than at any time since the Index was released. Out of 198 countries, 101 saw an increase in risk, compared with only 42 where the risk decreased. 
The impact is evident across the globe, with popular discontent over rising living costs emerging on the streets of developed and emerging markets alike, stretching from the EU, Sri Lanka and Peru to Kenya, Ecuador and Iran. 
As the conditions for civil unrest build in a growing number of countries, the severity and frequency of protests and labour activism is set to accelerate further over the coming months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[San Francisco (AFP) - A US jury on Wednesday ordered Meta to pay $174.5 million for violating live-streaming patents developed by a US Army veteran seeking to fix shortcomings in battlefield communications.
	

		A trial in Texas federal court ended with jurors deciding that "live" features at Facebook and Instagram used technology patented by Voxer, a company co-founded by Tom Katis, legal documents showed.
	

		"We believe the evidence at trial demonstrated that Meta did not infringe Voxer's patents," a company spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry.
	

		"We intend to seek further relief, including filing an appeal."
	

		Katis had reenlisted in the army after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and served as a Special Forces communications sergeant in Afghanistan, court filings said.
	

		When his combat unit was ambushed in Kunar province, he felt that the systems for coordinating reinforcements, medical evacuations and more "were ill-suited for time-sensitive communications with multiple groups in a highly disruptive environment," the complaint said.
	

		"Mr. Katis and his team began developing communications solutions in 2006 to remedy these shortcomings," his lawyers said.
	

		"The new technologies enabled transmission of voice and video communications with the immediacy of live communication and the reliability and convenience of messaging."
	

		Facebook approached San Francisco-based Voxer about potential collaboration after it launched a Walkie Talkie app in 2011, but no agreement was reached, according to legal documents.
	

		Instead, the lawsuit argued, Facebook went on to launch Facebook Live and Instagram Live, incorporating Voxer technology into the features.]]></summary>

* Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted on Wednesday that achieving a soft landing will be 'very challenging' 
* Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy rate 0.75 points to 3.25%, the highest since 2008 
* US central bank also projected rates will hit 4.4% this year and 4.6% in 2023 - higher than expected 
* Fed is attempting to cool down the economy to battle soaring inflation, which stands at 8.3% 
* Higher rates mean costlier borrowing, including mortgages and business loans, slowing growth 
* But by tamping down the economy, the Fed raises the risk of triggering job losses and layoffs 
The Federal Reserve has issued another super-sized increase to interest rates in a move intended to fight inflation, but which deepens the risk of a sharp economic downturn and job losses. 
At the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, the US central bank raised its policy rate by 75 basis points for the third time, to a range of 3 percent to 3.25 percent, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. 
The Fed is attempting to cool down the economy in order to tame rampant inflation, which remains stubbornly high at 8.3 percent -- but as interest rates climb, the path to a so-called 'soft landing' is narrowing.

Update #1: Fed attacks inflation with another big hike and expects more (AP)  
Update #2: Fed goes big with latest rate hike; Powell vows to 'keep at it' (Reuters)   
WNU Editor: Bottom line. Unemployment rates are going to climb in 2023. Expect more interest rate hikes, but only after the mid-term elections. And as for inflation, that mess is only going to get worse .... Fed-funds rate could end up as high as 5%, says overseer of $1.3 trillion in assets (Market Watch).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Reserve traveled rate by 75 basis points on September 21 and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has forecast another 125 basis point hike before the end of the year.  If that happens, it will take the benchmark rate to 4.4% by the end of the year, which is significantly higher than the June estimate of 3.8%.  The Fed has also hinted that it only expects rate cuts to be considered in 2024.
The expectation of higher rates pushed the 2-year Treasury note to 4.1%, its highest level since 2007. This could attract several investors seeking safety in this uncertain macro environment.  Higher rates are also likely to reduce the appeal of risky assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies and may delay the start of a new uptrend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Historically speaking when a country orders a military mobilization while fighting a war, its neighbors follow suit within a few hours if not days. But after Putin's announcement early today that he had ordered a partial mobilization, all that I have been hearing from the leaders of NATO and countries that border Russia is nothing but rhetoric denouncing this move (see above video). 
No calls to match Russia's partial mobilization. No calls to even declare a partial wartime industrial mobilization. Even Ukraine is silent on matching this Russian mobilization.

You can take this to the bank. 
If the West does nothing in the coming days to say that they will match Russia's mobilization efforts, this is going to cause panic in Ukraine that the West is now abandoning them. And in the eyes of the Kremlin, another example on how weak and ineffective the West has become. 
My prediction. 
The West (primarily the U.S.) will announce more troop deployments to eastern Europe, and more aid to Ukraine in the coming days. But it will fall short from what Ukraine needs, and it will certainly not match what Russia is going to do.]]></summary>

In a televised address on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of Russia's reservist forces to help boost the war effort in Ukraine.
The mobilization of these forces will serve to “protect our nation, its sovereignty and territorial integrity" as well as "ensure the security of our people and those in areas that have been liberated”, he said, the latter a reference to occupied areas of Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden accused Russia on Wednesday of making "reckless" and "irresponsible" threats to use nuclear weapons and said Moscow had violated the core tenets of United Nations membership by invading Ukraine.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Biden slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin for starting an unprovoked war that some 40 U.N. members were helping Ukraine fight through funding and weapons.
Earlier on Wednesday, Putin ordered a Russian mobilization to fight in Ukraine and made a thinly veiled threat to use nuclear weapons, in what NATO called a "reckless" act of desperation in the face of a looming Russian defeat.
Biden echoed that sentiment.

Putin is trying to change the course of the Ukraine war. Will it work?
 Russian President Vladimir Putin committed to a partial military mobilization in a speech Wednesday, where he also threatened nuclear retaliation against the West. It was a sign of Putin’s willingness to escalate the war in Ukraine, as Kyiv’s successful counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region has recaptured territory and pushed back Russian front lines. 
Putin stopped short of decreeing a full national mobilization, instead only drafting the army reserves, a move he said was “necessary and urgent.” Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu later confirmed that Russia would call about 300,0…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAO PAULO (Reuters) - At least nine people have died after part of a warehouse near the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo collapsed on Tuesday, during a visit by two congressional candidates.
Congressional candidates Jones Donizette and Ely Santos were visiting Brazilian container company Multiteiner when part of a concrete structure inside the warehouse collapsed over them and company employees.
Donizette said in a Facebook post that he and Santos had both been rescued, but a local fire department said at least nine people had died in the collapse.
The fire department added that 31 people had been rescued and 28 of these taken to nearby hospitals, though a spokesperson said rescue teams believed there could still be more people trapped under the debris.

NEW YORK — U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said Tuesday that a breakdown in global cooperation amid Russia’s war in Ukraine is exacerbating the top threats to human existence, including food insecurity and climate change. 
Guterres said problems such as poverty, indebtedness, online hate and harassment, and a loss of biodiversity are resulting from the international system’s failure to function. 
“Divides are growing deeper. Inequalities are growing wider. Challenges are spreading farther,” Guterres said at the annual gathering of leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
“We have a duty to act. And yet we are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction,” he said.

Aerial images showed a devastating scene of dozens of black glossy mammals strewn across a long beach, stuck on the waterline where the frigid southern ocean meets the sand.
Locals covered survivors with blankets and doused them with buckets of water to keep them alive, as other whales nearby tried in vain to twitch free and yet more lay dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two key parties in France's left-wing alliance were Wednesday facing crises after senior figures were accused of violence against women, with a Greens party chief stepping back from his role days after a colleague from hard-left France Unbowed.
Julien Bayou was "suspended from his role" as co-president of the Greens' bloc in the National Assembly (lower house), the party said late Tuesday, after he was accused of psychologically abusing an ex-partner.
"We are a feminist party, and so we place ourselves at the service of women's testimony... we acknowledged that the only way to show we weren't pretending and weren't hiding was a temporary suspension," Sandra Regol, vice-president of the Green MPs' group, told broadcaster Franceinfo on Wednesday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps more than any other French director, Jean-Jacques Annaud has always felt at home making films in Hollywood, with the American movie capital's flair for the epic and the spectacular.
Now, the 78-year-old Oscar-winner behind "The Name of the Rose," "Seven Years in Tibet" and "Enemy at the Gates" is returning to Tinseltown with his latest film, "Notre-Dame On Fire" ("Notre-Dame Brule") -- a thriller about the real-life blaze at the beloved cathedral in Paris.
Annaud spoke to AFP via phone from France's capital as organizers of next month's The American French Film Festival (TAFFF) announced Tuesday that his movie will be their opening night Los Angeles gala premiere.
"I'm close to Notre-Dame now and far away from Los Angeles. But part of my heart remains in Los Angeles," said Annaud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are set to blast off to the International Space Station Wednesday on a Russian-operated flight despite soaring tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
NASA's Frank Rubio and Russia's Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin are scheduled to take off from the Russia-leased Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1354 GMT, according to Russian space agency Roscosmos.
Rubio will become the first US astronaut to travel to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz rocket since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into pro-Western Ukraine on February 24.
In response, Western capitals including Washington have hit Moscow with unprecedented sanctions and bilateral ties have sunk to new lows.

The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Wednesday morning that the storm had grown stronger, registering maximum wind speeds of 130 miles per hour (210 kilometers per hour) as it barreled toward Bermuda.
The NHC said Fiona was 105 miles (170 kilometers) north of Turks and Caicos and had been upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane, the second highest level on the Saffir-Simpson scale.
"Swells from Fiona are expected to reach Bermuda by early Thursday. The swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the NHC said in its latest advisory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, warning the West that if it continued what he called its "nuclear blackmail" that Moscow would respond with the might of all its vast arsenal.
"If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we use all available means to protect our people - this is not a bluff," Putin said in a televised address to the nation.
Putin said he had signed a decree on a partial mobilisation, which significantly escalates the conflict.
Putin said his aim was to "liberate" east Ukraine's Donbas region, and that most people in the regions under Russian control did not want to be ruled by Kyiv.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation.
The policy decision, due to be announced at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world's economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks as the value of the dollar soars.
While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00%-3.25% range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be rele…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) -A U.S. Navy warship and a Canadian frigate carried out a routine transit of the Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, the U.S. military said, an operation which comes amid heightened military tensions between Beijing and Taipei.
In recent years, U.S. warships, and on occasion those from allied nations such as Britain and Canada, have routinely sailed through the strait, drawing the ire of China, which claims Taiwan over the objections of the island's democratically elected government.
In a statement, the U.S. Navy said its Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Higgins and the Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class frigate Vancouver conducted the transit through a corridor in the strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state.

"There is no other way to characterize this except for nuclear terrorism."
The missile struck near the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant (SUNPP), which is about 160 miles west of the six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest such station. Shelling of that Russian-controlled facility—which Russia and Ukraine have blamed on each other—has fueled fears of a disaster in the nation home to Chernobyl.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A top adviser to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned on Tuesday that China's foot-dragging on debt relief could burden dozens of low- and middle-income countries with years of debt servicing problems, lower growth and underinvestment.
Yellen's counselor Brent Neiman criticized China's "unconventional" debt practices and its failure to move forward with debt relief at an event at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"China’s enormous scale as a lender means its participation is essential," Neiman said in the speech, first reported by Reuters, citing estimates that China has $500 billion to $1 trillion in outstanding official loans, mainly to low and middle-income countries.

He told Politico that he was aware of the "populist threat he faces," and said that the more center-right parties needed to "reexamine" their relationships with these types of groups. He noted that far-right parties are on the verge of taking unprecedented power in Europe.

Separatist authorities in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, as well as in the southern Kherson region, said they would hold the vote over five days beginning Friday this week and ending on Tuesday.
These territories are on the frontlines of a sweeping Ukrainian counter-offensive that has seen Kyiv's forces retake hundreds of towns and villages that had been controlled by Russia for months.
Their integration into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict as Moscow could try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.

It is the earliest known evidence of human opium use, according to a statement released on Tuesday by Tel Aviv University, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Israel Antiquities Authority.
The Canaanites used the psychoactive drug as an "offering for the dead," researchers believe, according to the statement.
The ceramic vessels containing opium were found during excavations at Tel Yehud, near Tel Aviv, where Canaanite tombs dating back to the 14th century BC are located.
"This exciting discovery confirms historical writings and archaeological hypotheses according to which opium and its trade played a central role in the cultures of the Near East," the joint statement said.

The Horn of Africa nation is on the brink of a second famine in just over a decade, enduring its worst drought in 40 years after failed rainy seasons since late 2020 wiped out crops and livestock.
With a fifth monsoon forecast to fail, the United Nations warned this month that time was running out to save lives as it urged donors to contribute more to the relief effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SpaceX will apply for an exemption from US sanctions against Iran in a bid to offer its satellite internet service to the country, owner Elon Musk said on Monday.
"Starlink will apply for an exemption from sanctions against Iran," Musk said in response to a tweet from a science reporter.
Musk had initially announced that the Starlink satellite internet service had been made available on every continent -- "including Antarctica" -- with the company planning to launch up to 42,000 satellites to boost connectivity.
Iranian-born science journalist Erfan Kasraie had said on Twitter that bringing the service to Iran could be a "real game changer for the future" of the country, which elicited Musk's response. 
Launched at the end of 2020, Starlink offers high-speed broadband service to customers in areas poorly served by fixed and mobile terrestrial networks through a constellation of satellites in low earth orbit. 
The service received notoriety after supplying antennas and modems to the Ukrainian military to improve its communications capabilities in its war with Russia.
Starlink is monetized through the purchase of antennas, modems and subscriptions with rates that vary by country. 
Nearly 3,000 Starlink satellites have been deployed since 2019 and SpaceX is conducting about one launch a week, using its own Falcon 9 rockets to speed up its deployment.
Iran has been under a tightened US sanctions regime since former president Donald Trump terminated a 2015 agreement over its nuclear activities. 
While current President Joe Biden supports a renegotiation of the deal, Iranian insistence on long-term guarantees from Washington has stalled discussions. 
New rounds of sanctions were imposed on Iran this month after a Tehran-based company helped ship drones to Russia, and in response to a massive cyberattack targeting Albania in July allegedly carried out by Iran's intelligence ministry.

They sued Amaral for libel. In 2015, a Portuguese court ruled in their favour, ordering Amaral to pay them damages. Two years later the ruling was reversed by Portugal's highest court.
