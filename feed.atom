(Reuters) - Russia successfully test-fired a hypersonic Zircon cruise missile over a distance of about 1,000 km (625 miles), the defence ministry said on Saturday. 
The missile was fired from the Barents Sea and hit a target in the White Sea, it said. 
Video released by the ministry showed the missile being fired from a ship and blazing into the sky on a steep trajectory. 
President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems. Hypersonic weapons can travel at nine times the speed of sound, and Russia has conducted previous test-launches of the Zircon from warships and submarines in the past year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the gun control debate rages in the United States after the latest gruesome massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, you can be pretty sure those who stand up for gun rights, harden on soft targets, and support the Second Amendment won’t actually read the text of the Second Amendment on air or in print.
Why would Second Amendment absolutists ignore the actual wording of the Amendment?  Because of the pesky second and third words in the text itself: “Well regulated”.
Here is the full text of the Second Amendment:

“A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms will not be infringed.”

A SnapStream search of cable news shows that since the killing of 21 people in Uvalde, Texas, the term “well-regulated” h…]]></summary>

I learned that the 18-year-old mass murderer plays video games like Fortnite and Call of Duty.  I learned that at one point the monster used a knife to cut his face.  I learned that on his 18th birthday, he bought two assault rifles    photos of which he took and posted them online with the caption “my weapons”.

I don’t care that he had a difficult upbringing.  I don’t care how hard college was for him.  I don’t care if he had a hard time making friends.

It’s not because I lack sympathy.  It’s because all my sympathy is exhausted for the carnage he left behind.  I care that 10 year old Jacklyn Jaylen Caz…]]></summary>

Reuters: Iran shows off underground drone base, but not its location -state media 
(Reuters) - The Iranian army has given some details - but not the exact location - of an underground base for its military drones, state media reported on Saturday, amid simmering tensions in the Gulf. 
State TV said 100 drones were being kept in the heart of the Zagros mountains, including Ababil-5, which it said were fitted with Qaem-9 missiles, an Iranian-made version of air-to-surface U.S. Hellfire. 
"No doubt the drones of Islamic Republic of Iran's armed forces are the region's most powerful," army commander Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi said. "Our capability to upgrade drones is unstoppable," he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Bankrupt Sri Lanka Takes Russia Oil as Fuel Crisis Persists 
(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka is receiving Russian crude oil that it will use to make fuel as the bankrupt nation faces crippling shortages of everything from gasoline to diesel. 
The Russian grade of Siberian Light will be processed at Ceylon Petroleum Corp.’s refinery in Sapugaskanda, Chairman Sumith Wijesinghe said in a phone interview. The country’s sole refinery is set to receive crude on May 28, enabling its restart for the first time in over two months, according to its power and energy minister in an earlier tweet. 
Sri Lanka is the latest Asian nation to accept Russian crude after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine prompted widespread condemnation and sanctions. Most refiners in the US and across Europe have halted purchases from the OPEC+ producer, prompting the cost of Russian oil to plummet, while opportunistic buying from Asian customers in China and India has surged.

The visit by the nine-member delegation to the region is the latest stage in a case the plaintiffs hope will set a new worldwide precedent.
Leading the demand for "climate justice" is 41-year-old Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya, who lives in the mountains close to the city of Huaraz.

The chips in question were found inside a recovered example of the 9S932-1, a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle that is part of the larger Barnaul-T system, a Pantsir air defense system, a Ka-52 “Alligator” attack helicopter, and a Kh-101 (AS-23A Kodiak) cruise missile.

   Daily Mail: Biden raises eyebrows by saying North Korea stood with the US against Russia and whispering 'I am your Commander in Chief' during Naval Academy speech 
* 'Did anybody think, when I called for sanctions against Russia, in addition to NATO, did Australia, Japan, North Korea ... would stand up and support?' 
* Biden charged Vladimir Putin with trying to wipe out Ukraine's culture 
* North Korea was one of the four countries to vote against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia' invasion of Ukraine 
* Belarus, Eritrea and Syria also voted against the resolution. Cuba, Nicaragua and China abstained from the vote 
President Biden mistakenly claimed Friday in his commencement address to graduates at the Naval Academy that North Korea side with the U.S. against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. 
'Did anybody think, when I called for sanctions against Russia, in addition to NATO, did Australia, Japan, North Korea, some of the [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries would stand up and support those sanctions?' Biden asked the more than 1,200 midshipmen in the class of 2022.

Bloomberg: Russian Wins in Eastern Ukraine Spark Debate Over Course of War 
(Bloomberg) -- Russian troops are making steady progress in Ukraine’s east on the back of more-concentrated artillery and air power, now controlling almost all of the Luhansk region and threatening to encircle thousands of Ukraine’s most experienced troops. 
That is sparking fears that Russia could be poised for a bigger breakthrough, and leading to increasingly panicked calls from Kyiv for even more powerful offensive weapons. 
Russia’s capture of a series of towns including Popasna means its forces hold 95% of the Luhansk region that makes up the northern half of the Donbas area. 
On Friday, Ukraine’s military command said Russian troops were pushing on from Popasna toward the town of Bakhmut, 32 kilometers (20 miles) west, seeking to isolate Ukrainian forces in a pocket of government-held territory around Sievierodonetsk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“If you swim at the same pace every day,” Ms. Lepinski said, “you won’t get as much benefit.”  On the one hand, she added, interval training is more fun.  “And two, that challenges your heart a little better.”
Mr. Ksebati and Ms. Lepinski said a good beginner or intermediate workout is 1,000 to 1,500 meters, or 20 to 30 laps, which should take around half an hour.  Start with a short warm-up — maybe a 4×50 at an easy pace — to get your heart rate up.  You can mix up different strokes, do breaststroke or backstroke rather than freestyle for some variety.  Then do a 4×25 using a plank to activate your legs.
Next comes the main set, or most of your workout.  If you’re working on speed, do 8×50 (eight rounds with a break after each) at a brisk pace.  If you want to increase your endurance, try a moderately paced ladder, going up and down the length of your intervals: 1×50, 1×100, 1×200, 1×100, 1×50.
Finally comes the return to calm, another 4×50 swim at a relaxed pace.  You can take a longer break – one or two minutes – between the warm-up, the main series and the cool-down.
It’s a bit confusing at first, but once you get the lingo down, you can follow almost any swim workout.  Want even more structure or a goal to achieve?  Apps like MySwimPro provide personalized workout plans, or you can find your local American masters swimmers crew.  (In the swimming world, “masters” simply means adult.)
Above all, enjoy the process.  For many swimmers, the water isn’t just a place to train, it’s also a sanctuary.  “It’s hard to think about the stress of the world when you’re wondering, ‘When is my next breath?  Where is the end of the pool?  What platform am I on?  said Ms. Lepinski.  “When you slip under water, the world goes away.”

Ukrainian troops could withdraw from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces are close to surrounding, an official there says. 
Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, said Russians were in part of the city. 
"It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave." 
Russia has made seizing the whole eastern Donbas region a key war aim. 
Ukraine is pleading for long-range weaponry to resist Russia's advance, but the US has so far not offered it.

Bloomberg: Colombian Voters Seem Headed Toward a Radical Shift on Sunday 
(Bloomberg) -- Colombians head to the polls on Sunday amid strong indications that the anti-establishment mood sweeping Latin America could lead them to abandon the pro-business Washington-centered model they’ve embraced for decades. 
Presidential frontrunner Gustavo Petro, 62, a one-time guerrilla and later Bogota mayor, has tapped especially younger voters’ yearning for radical change, pledging to tax wealthy landowners, go green by phasing out oil and coal and restore ties with the socialist government next door in Venezuela.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Hundreds of Lithuanians are clubbing together to buy an advanced military drone for Ukraine in its war against Russia, in a show of solidarity with a fellow country formerly under Moscow's rule.
Some 3 million euros ($3.2 million) have been raised in just three days - out of the 5 million euros needed - largely in small amounts, according to Laisves TV, a Lithuanian internet broadcaster that launched the drive.
"Before this war started, none of us thought that we would be buying guns. But it's a normal thing now. Something must be done for the world to get better," said Agne Belickaite, 32, who sent 100 euros as soon as the fundraising launched on Wednesday.

Military.com: Navy Leader Floats Idea of Selling Troubled Littoral Combat Ships to South America 
The Navy's top uniformed leader told Congress that the U.S. government should consider selling ships from its troubled littoral combat fleet it plans to decommission to countries in South America. 
The Navy has faced sharp criticism for its latest plan to decommission all of its Freedom-class littoral combat ships. 
The youngest ship, USS St. Louis (LCS-19), was commissioned less than two years ago in August 2020. 
"We should consider offering these ships to other countries that would be able to use them effectively," Adm. Michael Gilday said when asked by Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., about the Navy's plan to decommission nine of the ships in its upcoming budget proposal at a Senate committee hearing Thursday.

Mr Trump said cynical politicians are “seeking to exploit the tears of sobbing families”.

“When Joe Biden blamed the gun lobby, he was talking about Americans like you,” he told the audience at the NRA conference. 

“He was shamefully suggesting that Republicans are somehow okay with letting school shootings happen,” he said. 

“This rhetoric is highly divisive and dangerous, and most importantly, it’s wrong.”]]></summary>

Something is wrong in America.  We don’t know how to stop aggression and death.
The massacres in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas have once again shaken us.  We are preparing to fight the scourge of gun violence that threatens every part of the country: grocery stores and churches, street corners and malls, and schools full of schoolchildren.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also, look a little deeper and clay can give Gauff as much benefit as she gets out of it.  At 5-foot-9, Gauff is about the average height of top players these days, but she has long legs.  This can help her cover a lot of ground in a few quick steps, but it can make balls that sit low on grass and hard courts a little more difficult for her.
If there was a common thread running through Gauff’s first three matches, it was how often she was well placed.  The balls hit the clay and bounce right into her strike zone, giving her a series of belt-high fastballs she can play on, while taking advantage of the extra split second the clay gives her to put her feet or slide into position.
Always aggressive and on the hunt for forehands, she will inevitably make her share of mistakes, but so far she has hit more winners than unforced errors, which is always a good sign for any player.  She also rarely appeared unbalanced.
“I really like sliding,” she said.  “I think it helps me recover faster after I reach the ball. Then also, I mean, I play pretty hard on my forehand, so I think the clay bounces the ball even higher.
For her part, Anisimova, 20, also spent most of her childhood in Florida, but she said she became more comfortable on clay largely by playing numerous junior tournaments in the Latin American countries, where red clay is also much more common than her.  is in the United States.
Anisimova is a dangerous returner, capable of punishing slower serves, especially with her near-death backhand.  She also knows that her footwork and movement may be the weakest part of her still-developing game, and longer points on clay inevitably require her to cover more ground.  Clay makes his weakness a little less weak. 
“It gives me more time,” she said of clay after her victory over Muchova.  “Hard courts can sometimes be a bit too fast.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian Central Bank @Reuters   
Reuters: Brussels says about $24 bln of Russian central bank assets frozen in EU, less than expected 
BRUSSELS, May 25 (Reuters) - European Union states have reported the freezing of about 23 billion euros ($24.5 billion) of assets of the Russian Central Bank, a top EU official said on Wednesday, revealing for the first time a figure that was expected to be much higher. 
Russia has publicly said that Western sanctions led to the freezing of about $300 billion of its central bank's assets globally. 
Of these frozen assets, only less than one-tenth is in the EU, according to information that the European Commission has collected from the 27 EU governments, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders told a news conference.
He said that about 23 billion euros had been frozen in the EU since the start of the war in Ukraine in February, a figure that is dwarfed by the $100 billion frozen by the United States.

WNU Editor: This is far less than the $300 billion that was previously reported. The U.S. says they have seized $100 billion. Reuters is also saying that its sources in Moscow are saying that worldwide $300 billion in assets has been frozen. But I have been following this story since day one. And if you dig deep the Kremlin and the Russian Central Bank have never officially said how much money has been seized.  
I know two months before the invasion the Kremlin told many Russian companies to pull out their money from the West in the event of more sanctions being imposed. It looks like many followed this warning. It also looks like the Russian government has far more money than what they are acknowledging.]]></summary>

"Kandalaksha is something of an anomaly. He is from Russia, and describes himself as a political refugee. An opponent of President Vladimir V. Putin’s government, he left his homeland in 2014 when Moscow annexed Crimea and began supporting a separatist war in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk," reported Carlotta Gall. "'I was fighting the Putin regime,' he said, 'and I understood the hottest place to fight against the Putin regime was in Ukraine.'

He does it without breaking eye contact, without stopping to breathe.  He doesn’t seem to notice that he’s doing it.  It’s a reflexive, unconscious movement, the best way to demonstrate what it means.
Díaz does not speak, he says, Wayúu, the language of Colombia’s indigenous community to which he can trace his roots.  He also does not wear traditional clothes or maintain any customs.  Life took him away from La Guajira, a strip of land bordered by the Caribbean Sea on one side and Venezuela on the other, the Wayúu homeland.
That’s when he traces his veins with his finger, feels his heartbeat.  “I feel Wayúu,” he says.  He may not be – by his own estimation – a “pure” Wayúu, but t…]]></summary>

Leaked copy of draft shows Beijing wants more involvement in policing, cybersecurity and marine mapping 
China is pursuing a sweeping regional economic security deal with Pacific nations that would dramatically expand its influence and reach into those countries, in a pact that has western countries and some Pacific leaders deeply worried. 
The wide-ranging deal lays out China’s vision for a much closer relationship with the Pacific, especially on security matters, with China proposing it would be involved in training police, cybersecurity, sensitive marine mapping and gaining greater access to natural resources.

   Warzone/The Drive: Mysterious South China Sea Missile Launch Claimed To Be Caught By Airliner (Updated) 
Video taken from an airliner appears to show the launch of a missile from a ship or a submarine in the South China Sea. 
Video has emerged on social media that is said to show an apparent launch of a missile, possibly from a submarine, as viewed from a Cathay Pacific Boeing 777 flying over the South China Sea. Unseen individuals can be heard in the clip talking about whether it is heading their way. 
Twitter user @jchovernut, a pilot for U.S.-based airline Allegiant Air and a veteran of the U.S. Navy's submarine community, posted the video, seen below, online on Tuesday. "They were over the South China Sea & were issued a last-minute hectic call from ATC: 'turn left 90 degrees immediately!!,'" according to one Tweet accompanying the video.

Wednesday night’s strike hit the site of the Parchin military complex, about 60 km southeast of the capital, with quadcopter suicide drones, according to the Iranian sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.  The drones exploded in a building used by the Ministry of Defense for drone development research, killing a young engineer who worked at the ministry and injuring another person, they said.

It’s been a devastating week for the people of Uvalde, Texas, but also for a nation struggling to understand how this kind of horror can happen again.
The gruesome details of 19 elementary school children and two adults killed by a lunatic 18 year old who had just purchased two assault weapons shortly after his birthday were painfully difficult to digest.  And the predictable rhetorical pattern that followed this tragedy sounds like the worst version of groundhog day already.
Like every other mass shooting that has come before, the immediate aftermath of the Uvalde school shooting saw political media rhetoric fall apart with two clear subgroups.
On the one hand, there was anger and disgust that such an event could happen again and an immediate call for policies that could …]]></summary>

A recent court ruling found that racism operates in the Greenfield Police Department.  Mayor Roxann Wedegartner’s response demonstrates that she is not listening to a diverse constituency and failing to collaborate with city officials and employees.  First, she said she would consider appealing the verdict (with taxpayers’ money).  She does not seem to grasp that racism is pervasive in all American institutions.  No matter how well-meaning European Americans are, change will never happen without this fundamental recognition.  The court’s decision is an invitation, a mandate, to review the policy and make amends.  Let the judgment be an opportunity for change, not hunkering down with secure blinders.  Second, alleging that he lied under oath, Wedegartner discharged the white police officer who testified on behalf of the black officer who brought the case.  And she confined him to his house during working hours!  Is she judge, prosecutor and jury?  I am delighted with the number of citizens who joined in testifying outside of City Hall as well as the members of Council who spoke.  In the civil rights movement of the 60s, a favorite freedom song was “Which Side Are You On?”  Mayor Wedegartner, which side are you on?

The price of regular gasoline in California has already risen to over $6 a gallon, and it’s nearly impossible to find gasoline under $4 anywhere else.  Nationally, prices have risen nearly 50 cents per gallon in the past month.
The war in Ukraine is the most immediate cause of the price spike, as global refiners, tankers and traders shun Russian exports, pulling up to three million barrels of oil a day off the market.  Energy traders have also pushed up oil prices in hopes that Western governments will impose even tougher sanctions on Russia and its energy industry.
But another reason for the high prices is that, in sp…]]></summary>

Auto sales also rose as car buyers purchased vehicles after months of shortages.
Incomes are also rising, the result of a robust labor market and the fastest wage growth in decades.  But income is not keeping up with spending or rising prices: after-tax income rose 0.3% in April from the previous month and remained flat after controlling for inflation.

Everything changed this month, when Biddle finally got his wish.


She staged one of the first productions in the country of “Cats: Young Actors Edition”, an hour-long version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1981 hit musical, adapted by iTheatrics for Concord Theatricals and released to schools across North America last fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A killer whale - orca - that strayed from the ocean and began swimming up the River Seine in France earlier this month is now at risk of dying, a researcher monitoring the mammal told local media. 
"It is in a life-threatening condition ... its state of health is very poor," Gerard Mauger, vice-president of Cotentin Cetacean Study Group (GECC), was quoted as saying on France 3 television's website.
The whale is unable to find enough food in the river and the fresh water is increasingly damaging its health. "It is really complicated to find solutions to try to make it go back to the salt water", Mauger said, adding that helping the animal risked stressing it.
The 4-metre (13-foot) orca, identified as a male, was first spotted at the mouth of the Seine on May 16 between the port of Le Havre and the town of Honfleur in Normandy, before it travelled dozens of kilometers upstream to reach west of the city of Rouen.
Local state authorities were not immediately available for comment.
Muriel Arnal, president of French animal rights organization One Voice, told Reuters there was an urgent need to rescue the whale.
She also noted that male killer whales are "mummy's boys", generally sticking to their mothers their entire lives. "We have to be fast," Arnal said, suggesting that using nets to guide the orca would be less stressful than placing it on a barge.

        <updated>2022-05-27T16:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More importantly, though, it negated nearly all of the reviews.  It was instructive, for example, to read most Madrid media accounts of the Mbappé deal.  Rather than a defeat for Madrid, Mbappé’s decision was presented as that of a mercenary and a traitor, a defector who gave his word to Pérez and then betrayed him.
Mbappé’s family were so distressed by this depiction that his mother decided to correct it publicly, claiming on Twitter that her son had never ‘gave his word’ to Real Madrid.
That he chose ‘El Chiringuito’ for his first appearance to discuss Super League was no accident either.  The show regularly features prominent Madrid supporters journalists known to burst into tears over the club’s successes, or rail against those – Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard – who are deemed to have brought dishonor to the club.
The spectacle is not, in this, an outlier.  Pérez oversees a vast network of soft news media, dependent not only on his grace and favor for information and access, but also intimidated by the breadth and weight of his business interests.  Pérez always claimed he was only powerful because he was Real Madrid president, but that’s not entirely true.  It is also powerful in many other ways.
This allowed him to lead Real Madrid as he sees fit.  Despite its size, the club’s hierarchy is relatively tight, with many recruitment decisions overseen by Pérez;  its general manager, José Ángel Sanchez;  and his chief scout, Juni Calafat.  Real Madrid is, in that sense, something of an aberration, almost a throwback to a time when most of its peers have diversified and deepened their personnel.
Pérez would say, of course, that it works: five Champions League finals in nine years is all the proof he needs.  This is perhaps his greatest gift.  No matter what he does, no matter how unlikely it seems, Pérez has a remarkable ability to emerge triumphant.
This may have been the year that destabilized the kingdom he so painstakingly built.  Rather, it could turn out to be the year that cemented him for good.

RFE: Iranian Oil Seized From Formerly Russian-Flagged Tanker Stopped Off Greece  
The United States has confiscated Iranian oil held on a Russian-operated ship near the Greek island of Evia in the Aegean Sea, according to news reports quoting Greek sources. 
 Following a "judicial intervention by U.S. authorities concerning the ship's cargo," the process is currently under way for the oil "to be handed over" at U.S. government expense, an unidentified official quoted on May 26 by the AP news agency said. 
The vessel was temporarily seized by Greek authorities on April 15 when it anchored off the port of Karystos on Evia. At the time, it was flying a Russian flag and was carrying a crew of 19 Russians.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States on Friday imposed fresh sanctions over North Korea's missile launches, including on two Russian banks, after Russia and China blocked action by the UN Security Council.
The Treasury Department said it was freezing any US assets and criminalizing transactions with the Far Eastern Bank and Bank Sputnik, Russian institutions accused of working with North Korea.
It also targeted Jong Yong Nam, alleged to be working out of Moscow-allied Belarus for North Korea's weapons research body, and a trading company affiliated with state carrier Air Koryo, which is already under sanctions.
Senior Treasury official Brian Nelson said the banks were targeted as they "knowingly provided significant financial services" to the North, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
"The United States will continue to implement and enforce existing sanctions while urging the DPRK to return to a diplomatic path and abandon its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles," he said in a statement.
The United States and South Korea have said that North Korea tested three rockets, including an intercontinental ballistic missile, on Wednesday and that it could be preparing its first nuclear test since 2017.
The United States on Thursday forced a vote at the Security Council on toughening sanctions, saying that North Korea had brazenly violated a unanimous 2017 resolution that warned of consequences for further tests.
But Russia, whose relations with the West have sharply deteriorated over the Ukraine war, and China vetoed the US-drafted resolution, saying that sanctions would heighten tensions.
The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, accused Beijing and Moscow of emboldening North Korea and said the United States would take unilateral measures against Pyongyang.

Gen. Cavoli is nominated to be NATO's next commander.  
The US general nominated to be the next commander of NATO suggested in a Senate hearing on Thursday that he may offer military options to facilitate grain exports from Ukraine and help break Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s southern coast. 
When asked what NATO could do about Russia’s blockade, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who currently serves as the commander of US Army Forces in Europe and Africa, said if he’s confirmed, he would “provide the military options required by our civilian leaders.” 
“Clearly the way we would approach that would have to be a whole of government approach, which may or may not include a military component,” he added.

The public is often presented with shocking images of muggings, muggings and brazen robberies occurring in major Democratic-run cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New Yorkand philadelphia cream.
A Google video search of the terms “Fox News” and “crime” returns countless results from various crime segments.  Meanwhile, on Fox News.com, his national “CRIME” label is filled with new messages several times an hour during the day.
The collective message from this endless barrage of segments and articles is that cities are simply dangerous places thanks to the irresponsible actions of the progressive politicians who run them.

I am not a lawyer.  However, that does not prevent me from understanding the absurdity of the originalist approach to the Constitution.  
Although I am amazed that 55 men devoted just under four months at the end of the 18th century to produce another type of government, I am clear-headed about their accomplishment.  History reveals that they weren’t totally on board, as only 42 appeared at the signing.  Three of those present were uncomfortable and refused to sign.  However, imagine how rare it is for 55 people, crammed into one room, to agree on everything.
And they were men.  Founding Fathers, the name coined by Warren G. Harding, is too patriarchal.  I prefer the Founders.  I know of only two offstage contributors: Abigail Ada…]]></summary>

In 1986, the Italian justice system launched a counter-offensive, with the Palermo prosecutor's office leading the charge. Judge Giovanni Falcone became a symbol of the fight against the mafia but on May 23, 1992, he was killed in a car bombing, along with his wife and three bodyguards. His colleague and friend Paolo Borsellino was murdered less than two months later.

   Washington Post: Ukrainian volunteer fighters in the east feel abandoned 
DRUZHKIVKA, Ukraine — Stuck in their trenches, the Ukrainian volunteers lived off a potato per day as Russian forces pounded them with artillery and Grad rockets on a key eastern front line. Outnumbered, untrained and clutching only light weapons, the men prayed for the barrage to end — and for their own tanks to stop targeting the Russians. 
“They [Russians] already know where we are, and when the Ukrainian tank shoots from our side it gives away our position,” said Serhi Lapko, their company commander, recalling the recent battle. “And they start firing back with everything — Grads, mortars. 
“And you just pray to survive.”

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/ted-cruz-russia-2657401507/"/>
        <updated>2022-05-27T13:47:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was one of several lawmakers who wrote to the Biden administration in September demanding an end to the embargo on Russian ammunition imports.
"The group sent a letter dated Sept. 3 to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen accusing the administration of using the sanctions as a means to enact gun control measures and arguing that it would exacerbate a shortage of ammunition," said the report. "'Wholesalers, retailers, small businesses, gun owners, and shooting sportsmen rely on ammunition imported from Russia and are rightfully concerned that this is an attempt at gun control,' the lawmakers wrote in the letter."
The sanctions were first imposed in response to the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok. He survived this attempt but was imprisoned on dubious charges upon returning to Russia.
'Two weeks before the letter was sent, the lobbying arm of the NRA wrote about the sanctions, calling it an 'overreach' and 'crusade against law-abiding gun owners' by the Biden administration," said the report. "The letter mirrors the same points the NRA made in its article. The organization wrote that it is exploring all of its legislative, legal and policy options to block the policy."

Other Republican lawmakers who signed the letter include Caucus Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY), and far-right Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Lauren Boebert (R-CO).
This comes despite the fact that Cruz has publicly demanded that the Biden administration sanction Russia more harshly as the Ukraine invasion has unfolded. He spearheaded a legislative effort to sanction the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which the administration held off on to maintain good relations with Germany. This became moot after Germany canceled the project itself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author Bram Stoker only had one bloodthirsty creature of the undead in mind when a visit to the seaside Yorkshire town of Whitby inspired "Dracula".
But to mark the 125th anniversary of the chilling book's publication, 1,369 people have gathered to break the world record for the largest crowd of vampires.
They needed to stand together in the same place for five minutes to break the Guinness record, which previously stood at 1,039 people set at a 2011 event in the US state of Virginia.
Costume requirements were strict: attendees had to wear black shoes, black trousers or dress, a waistcoat, shirt, black cape or "collared overcoat" -- and, of course, fangs.
"We'd like to say a BIG thank you to everyone who has come along to Whitby Abbey to help make this happen -– you all looked fang-tastic!" organizers English Heritage tweeted after the stunt on Thursday evening.
The novel was first published in 1897, seven years after Stoker visited the picturesque seaside town in northern England and took creative inspiration from the Gothic surroundings of its 11th century abbey.
The Irish author found the name Dracula in the local library, in a book about a 15th-century prince in present-day Romania who was said to have impaled his enemies on wooden stakes.

The frail but flamboyant 92-year-old matriarch has been the driving force in the family's comeback from exile to the peak of power in the May 9 polls.
President-elect Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos has described his mother as "the supreme politician in the family", one who wields a "very big influence".
Known for her lavish spending, Imelda symbolizes the greed of her husband Ferdinand Marcos's dictatorship, which ended in 1986 after a popular revolt ousted him.
An estimated $10 billion was stolen from state coffers over the course of his brutal and corrupt 20-year rule that left the country impoverish…]]></summary>

"The West has declared a total war on us, on the Russian World. Nobody makes any secret of this," Lavrov said at a meeting of the Council of the heads of Russia’s constituent territories at the Foreign Ministry. 
Lavrov warned that the Western policy of "cancelling" Russia would continue for a long time.

WNU Editor: This is a transformation for Lavorv. From saying in March that the West has declared ‘total war’ on Russia (link here), to total war on the "Russian world". He is tapping into the perception among many Russians that the West is waging a Russiaphobe campaign.

“When the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, Western Union stopped sending funds there or withdrawing them from Afghanistan, but if you had Bitcoin, you were fine.  Your Bitcoin is there.  You can send it to anyone in the world if you have a phone.

Georgian voters turned out in record numbers to vote in the 2022 primary election, in a complete beating of the leftist media narrative that the electoral reform law enacted last year amounted to “Jim Crow 2.0”.

MSNBC Host Joy Reid called the law like “putting Georgia back on an express train in Jim Crow times”.
“These laws are not only stupid, these laws are not only racist, but they are destructive to a functioning democracy”, mentioned MSNBC Contributor Jason Johnson.
MSNBC anchor Tiffany Cross called Georgia’s “voter suppression” law.
CNN anchor Don Lemon tagged it “Jim Crow 2.0” and “nothing less than an attack on the right to vote”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent statement released by French authorities has pledged France and Australia to “rebuild” a bilateral relationship – after accusing the previous Morrison government of a “breach of trust”. 

It comes as France accused its allies “of stabbing it in the back” – when Australia opted for nuclear-powered submarines to be built with US and British technology.

Following Australia’s federal election outcome, French President Emmanuel Macron called Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to congratulate him on his election win.

The full statement released by French authorities says:  

“After acknowledging the severe breach of trust following the decision of the previous prime minister, Scott Morrison to terminate the submarine contracts, the French president and Australia's prime minister have agreed to rebuild a bilateral relation based on trust and respect to jointly overcome global challenges, foremost among which is the climate emergency and the strategic challenges in the Indo-Pacific.”]]></summary>

Ms Heard returned to the stand for the last time ahead of closing arguments.

She claims she has been "harassed, humiliated and threatened" every day since accusing her former husband of physical and sexual abuse.

She was questioned if she was surprised by the number of people testifying against her.

British model Kate Moss denied rumours she was pushed down stairs by Mr Depp while they were dating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British supermodel Kate Moss denying Amber Heard's claim her former boyfriend Johnny Depp abused her was the "quickest testimony" of the whole trial, says Mitry Lawyers' Richard Mitry.

Mr Mitry said Ms Moss' testimony was not pivotal to the outcome of the case but was important because it "directly refuted" Ms Heard's claim about Depp in her statement.

During Ms Heard’s testimony, she mentioned Kate Moss and a rumour that the actor once pushed the model down a flight of stairs, leaving the door open for Depp’s legal team to bring her in to take the stand.

Ms Moss denied rumours she was pushed down stairs by Mr Depp while they were dating.

"By Kate Moss not only denying that in all of three minutes, which is probably the quickest testimony in this whole trial, categorically stating good things about him – naturally it's going to help his case."]]></summary>

China and Russia on Thursday blocked an effort to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea at the United Nations Security Council that was led by the U.S. after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un conducted a spate of missile tests this year, including the launch of several intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
Both China and Russia hold veto powers at the U.N. Security Council, which they exercised after the introduction of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) — North Korea’s official name — for the tests with more restrictive sanctions.

CNN: US preparing to approve advanced long-range rocket system for Ukraine 
Washington (CNN)The Biden administration is preparing to step up the kind of weaponry it is offering Ukraine by sending advanced, long-range rocket systems that are now the top request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials say. 
The administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. 
Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a gamechanger in their war against Russia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, The Daily Beast reported that a new video appears to show Brazilian police killing a mentally ill Black man inside a car with a gas grenade.
"Federal highway police stopped 38-year-old Genivaldo de Jesus Santos, as footage shows, pinning him to the ground, putting him in the back of a police car, and trapping his kicking legs with the door as gas billows out of the vehicle," reported Alice Tecotzky. "An autopsy confirmed that Santos, who suffered from schizophrenia, according to family members, died of asphyxiation."
"Santos’ nephew, Wallison de Jesus, told local media outlets that his uncle was unarmed," the report continued. "The nephew said that Santos became nervous after officers found medication packets during the encounter. As per the nephew’s account, he told officers that Santos needed the medication and that his uncle 'didn’t resist.'"
Brazilian Federal Police dispute this story, claiming that Santos "actively resisted" and that they only resorted to a gas grenade after "instruments of lesser offensive potential" failed to subdue him.
Brazil has rampant rates of police violence, particularly against Black civilians. According to The Washington Post, the incident has already sparked protests in Santos' hometown.
All of this comes as Brazil's presidential election is scheduled for October, where right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, notorious for his anti-Black remarks, is struggling in polls against former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OilPrice.com: Here's How Russian Crude Is Finding Its Way To Customers 
* Refinitiv Eikon: Greece has emerged as a new hub for Russian oil via ship-to-ship (STS) loadings. 
* Vortexa: Russia has been increasing fuel exports to Greece, with shipments set to jump to about 2.5 million barrels. 
* Trading Russian crude and oil products remain legal for now. 
Small tankers and ship-to-ship transfers are being used to keep the flow of Russian oil to China steady, Bloomberg reported this week, citing sources from the brokering industry.
Typically, the report notes, Russian ESPO crude is shipped directly to China. But lately, buyers are opting for loading the crude on small tankers and shipping it to South Korean waters, from where it is loaded onto supertankers and then taken to China. 
According to Bloomberg’s sources, the change is a result of reprioritization among buyers as shipowners avoid loading Russian oil because of Western sanctions. Currently, almost all of the ESPO available for sale is going to China.

WNU Editor: As high as oil prices are right now, I shudder when I think on what would happen if all Russia oil and energy exports are banned. The cost of oil would then go through the roof.

Rigzone/Bloomberg: Saudi Arabia Making $1B From Oil Exports Every Day  
Saudi Arabia’s oil exports reached $30 billion in March, the highest in at least six years, driven by a rally in oil prices and rising production. 
The value of crude exports, now almost $1 billion a day, increased by 123% year on year, the kingdom’s statistics office said. 
Saudi Arabia’s crude production rose to 10.3 million barrels a day in March, with Brent oil prices averaging $112 a barrel. Prices have jumped almost 50% this year, mostly due to the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The higher revenues helped the kingdom post a 57.5 billion riyal ($15 billion) budget surplus between January and March. It will be one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to make breaking European Union sanctions against Russia a crime, a move that would allow EU governments to confiscate assets of companies and individuals that evade EU restrictions against Moscow. 
Breaking EU sanctions on Russia is now a criminal offence in 12 EU countries. It is either an administrative or a criminal offence in 13 and two treat it only as an administrative offence, Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said. Penalties for sanction breaking across the EU vary accordingly. 
The Commission proposal aims to unify that approach to make sanctions evasion a serious crime in all members of the 27-nation bloc, he told a news conference.

FRANCE 24's Business Editor Kate Moody spoke to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, who criticised food export restrictions by countries such as India for "only making a crisis worse". She also called for governments to help "speed up" agricultural production "where this is still possible".]]></summary>

ABC News Australia: US and Japanese warplanes in show of strength following North Korean missile launches 
US jet fighters have joined Japanese warplanes in a show of strength, a day after North Korea launched ballistic missiles into the waters separating it with Japan. 
The exercise was meant to "showcase combined capabilities to deter and counter regional threats", the US military said in a statement. The flight of eight aircraft consisted of four American F-16 jets and four Japanese F-15 warplanes, according to Japan's Air Self-Defence Force. 
Japan and the United States wanted to show their combined resolve in the wake of North Korea's latest missile launches, two US officials told Reuters anonymously.

Rigzone: Oil Inventories Down to Dangerously Low Point 
 Crude oil inventories are down to a dangerously low point across Europe, North America, and OECD Asia just as OPEC+ spare production capacity has dwindled to the lowest levels since April 2020. 
That’s according to a new BofA Global Research report, which was sent to Rigzone on Monday. The report also highlighted that petroleum product inventories have fallen to “precarious levels” for middle distillates and gasoline “as the market heads into the peak of the U.S. driving season”. 
“As a result, refined petroleum cracks have recently spiked to record levels, contributing to boost volatility across the oil complex,” the BofA Global Research report stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]  The Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study (HKIAS) at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) continues to connect scholars around the globe, allowing them to explore interdisciplinary ideas and address real-world issues.   The most recent HKIAS Distinguished Lecture Series on Electronics and Photonics, held in March and April, was  supported in part by Kwang Hua Educational Foundation. The discussion topics covered nanotechnology, antenna design, 6G networks and much more, with five leading scientists outlining the latest research and potential applications of breakthrough technologies. The series attracted an international audience of over 2,000 scholars and guests.     The power of plasmonic biosensors    Nanotechnology and its biosensor applications are becoming ever more prevalent in the field of biomedical microsystems.   Kicking things off on March 1, Professor Stella W. Pang, Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Director of the Centre for Biosystems, Neuroscience, and Nanotechnology at CityU, spoke about “Nanotechnology for High-Performance Devices and Sensors”.     Noting the increased use of plasmonic sensors, she explained the ability of nanoimprint technology “to generate a large area of nanostructures within a few seconds”, showing high reproducibility and throughput. The novel 3D multiple layer plasmonic biosensors exhibit enhanced electric fields and a much higher sensitivity. This made it possible to detect lung cancer A549 live cells and nanoscale DNAs at very low concentrations by monitoring the highly sensitive resonance peak shift.   Also, hybrid coupling of plasmonic and photonic crystal modes leads to a record high sensitivity of 1376 nm/refractive index unit. “Combining these biosensors with 3D engineered platforms, we can separate cancer cells from normal cells for identification, which will further improve the sensitivity such that cancer patients could be diagnosed at a much earlier stage, potentially saving millions of lives,”…]]></summary>

   CNN: 'They were shooting directly at the journalists': New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted attack by Israeli forces 
(CNN)Several shots ring out in quick succession, cutting through a clear, blue spring morning in Jenin, in the West Bank. Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack. 
The cameraman filming the scene scrambles backwards to take cover behind a low concrete wall. Then a man cries out in Arabic: "Injured! Shireen, Shireen, oh man, Shireen! Ambulance!" 
When the camera operator pans around the corner, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh can be seen lying motionless, face down on the ground as another Palestinian reporter, Shatha Hanaysha, crouches down beside her, using a tree trunk for cover. Hanaysha reaches out and tries to rouse her as gunshots continue.   There's no response. Both women are wearing helmets and blue protective vests marked "Press."

					The UN Syria Commission of Inquiry said on Thursday that not extending current cross-border aid to Syria along the remaining route, would be a “failure of the highest order”.
