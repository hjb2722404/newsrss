It offers round-the-clock conveniences to the population and pledges to play an active, good corporate citizen role by helping those in need.  Since 2017, for example, the franchise has supported Pei Ho Counterparts, a social enterprise associated with distributing free meals to the underprivileged in some of Hong Kong’s neediest districts. To date, 7-Eleven has donated a total of 250,000 free meal boxes, water, and goodie bags to the conscientious social enterprise, benefitting groups such as the homeless, the elderly, and struggling families.  Recently, 7-Eleven announced its continued collaboration with Pei Ho Counterparts in a new Sik Tak Fan La campaign. Literally, “the meal is ready” in Cantonese, the new campaign aims to raise HK$2 million for the social enterprise. The sum will support the organisation’s work in providing free meals and supplies for the less privileged communities most in need on a more regular basis.  Mobilising 7-Eleven network and resources  By making the most of its robust, 1000-plus store network, 7-Eleven is well positioned to create a synergetic effect within individual neighbourhoods. The company’s network makes a compelling case for engaging the broader community in support of the campaign that is for a good cause.   “As part of the Hong Kong community and as an organisation that prioritises corporate social responsibility, we are committed to contributing to society,” said Choo Peng-chee, chief executive officer of DFI Retail North Asia, the operator of Hong Kong’s leading convenience store chain.   “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe impact,…]]></summary>

Daily Mail: US Air Force Academy in Colorado is blasted for holding woke 'diversity and inclusion' summit that saw cadets ordered to ditch 'gendered' language including mom, dad, boyfriend and girlfriend 
* A recent training seminar at the US Air Force Academy aimed to teach cadets about diversity and inclusion 
* The presentation included messages recommending that gendered terms be kicked to the curb 
* 'Colorblind' and 'I don't see color' were also recommended to be abandoned 

 * Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida has called the teachings 'destructive' 
The US Air Force Academy is under fire for holding diversity and inclusion training that urges cadets to use non-gendered language, scrapping words like 'mom,' and 'dad', as well as 'girlfriend' and 'boyfriend.' 
According to screenshots from the seminar, obtained by FOX News Digital, Air Force training officials are asking recruits to use generic terms like 'partner' instead of 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend,' and 'parent' or 'parents' instead of 'mom' and 'dad.' 
The slides shared by FOX News prompted outrage from many across the country, including Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL).

Washington Post: Pentagon bedeviled by recruitment failures as solutions prove elusive
Military officials and lawmakers on Wednesday painted a grim picture of recruiting efforts within the Defense Department, as a recent study suggests worrisome shortfalls could grow worse if more women decline to serve over restrictive abortion laws in many Republican-led states where U.S. personnel are based. 
The Pentagon has characterized the head winds in stark terms, saying its recruiting environment is the worst it has been since the end of the Vietnam War. 
Some of the military services will just barely meet their goals as the fiscal year ends later this month, officials said in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The Army, the armed forces’ largest branch, will miss its target by 30,000 soldiers, said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).

Bloomberg: Turkey Shocks With Another Rate Cut Despite Raging Inflation 
(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank delivered another shock cut to interest rates, despite inflation running at a 24-year high and with the lira trading at a record low. 
The Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Sahap Kavcioglu lowered the benchmark to 12% from 13% on Thursday, surprising most economists surveyed by Bloomberg. 
The lira extended declines after the announcement and was trading 0.2% weaker against the dollar as of 3:02 p.m. in Istanbul. 
Turkey is charting an economic strategy in defiance of mainstream monetary policy. It’s already been an outlier for much of this year, as the world’s central bankers unleashed the most aggressive tightening in decades, and stood out even more this week as countries like Indonesia and Brazil raised rates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yahoo Money: Fed rate hike could add $2.1 trillion to federal deficits, analysis finds 
The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 0.75% on Wednesday, making an aggressive move to tame inflation that could have other side effects — including a possible recession. 
The rate increase could also explode federal deficits even further in the years ahead.  A new analysis from the budget hawks at The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) predicts this week’s rate hike alone will add $2.1 trillion to government deficits over the next decade. 
That’s on top of a series of hikes we’ve already seen this year that are already set to add trillions more to the deficit in coming years. The central bank concluded its two-day policy meeting Wednesday by suggesting it could hike rates further in the months ahead.

Update #1: Another jumbo Fed rate hike poised to add $2.1T to national debt, CRFB says (FOX News)  
Update #2: Expected Interest Rate Hike Will Add $2 Trillion to the Deficit (Reason)   
WNU editor: The biggest loser with this interest rate increase is the US Federal Government. With $31 trillion in debt, every 1% increase in the Fed rate adds $300 billion in interest costs. 
So far in fiscal 2022, where interest have been low for the most part, the US Treasury has already spent $471 billion to just pay-off the government's interest payments.

A suspect has been taken into custody after the Washington Monument was vandalized with a splash of red paint and a lewd message on Tuesday night. 
The United States Park Police in Washington DC confirmed they had detained a male individual suspected of the vandalism. 
Photos from the National Mall showed a large splatter of red paint on the base of the monument, next to it a message that appeared to read 'Have u been f***ed by this' and below that a line saying 'Gov says tough sh*t.'

Maplecroft:  101 countries witness rise in civil unrest in last quarter  
Worst yet to come as socioeconomic pressure builds 
The world is facing an unprecedented rise in civil unrest as governments of all stripes grapple with the impacts of inflation on the price of staple foods and energy, according to the latest edition of our Civil Unrest Index (CUI). The data, covering seven years, shows that the last quarter saw more countries witness an increase in risks from civil unrest than at any time since the Index was released. Out of 198 countries, 101 saw an increase in risk, compared with only 42 where the risk decreased. 
The impact is evident across the globe, with popular discontent over rising living costs emerging on the streets of developed and emerging markets alike, stretching from the EU, Sri Lanka and Peru to Kenya, Ecuador and Iran. 
As the conditions for civil unrest build in a growing number of countries, the severity and frequency of protests and labour activism is set to accelerate further over the coming months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[San Francisco (AFP) - A US jury on Wednesday ordered Meta to pay $174.5 million for violating live-streaming patents developed by a US Army veteran seeking to fix shortcomings in battlefield communications.
	

		A trial in Texas federal court ended with jurors deciding that "live" features at Facebook and Instagram used technology patented by Voxer, a company co-founded by Tom Katis, legal documents showed.
	

		"We believe the evidence at trial demonstrated that Meta did not infringe Voxer's patents," a company spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry.
	

		"We intend to seek further relief, including filing an appeal."
	

		Katis had reenlisted in the army after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and served as a Special Forces communications sergeant in Afghanistan, court filings said.
	

		When his combat unit was ambushed in Kunar province, he felt that the systems for coordinating reinforcements, medical evacuations and more "were ill-suited for time-sensitive communications with multiple groups in a highly disruptive environment," the complaint said.
	

		"Mr. Katis and his team began developing communications solutions in 2006 to remedy these shortcomings," his lawyers said.
	

		"The new technologies enabled transmission of voice and video communications with the immediacy of live communication and the reliability and convenience of messaging."
	

		Facebook approached San Francisco-based Voxer about potential collaboration after it launched a Walkie Talkie app in 2011, but no agreement was reached, according to legal documents.
	

		Instead, the lawsuit argued, Facebook went on to launch Facebook Live and Instagram Live, incorporating Voxer technology into the features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns it will be 'very challenging' to tame inflation without steep job losses across the US economy after hiking interest rates to 3.25% - the highest level since 2008 
* Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted on Wednesday that achieving a soft landing will be 'very challenging' 
* Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy rate 0.75 points to 3.25%, the highest since 2008 
* US central bank also projected rates will hit 4.4% this year and 4.6% in 2023 - higher than expected 
* Fed is attempting to cool down the economy to battle soaring inflation, which stands at 8.3% 
* Higher rates mean costlier borrowing, including mortgages and business loans, slowing growth 
* But by tamping down the economy, the Fed raises the risk of triggering job losses and layoffs 
The Federal Reserve has issued another super-sized increase to interest rates in a move intended to fight inflation, but which deepens the risk of a sharp economic downturn and job losses. 
At the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, the US central bank raised its policy rate by 75 basis points for the third time, to a range of 3 percent to 3.25 percent, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. 
The Fed is attempting to cool down the economy in order to tame rampant inflation, which remains stubbornly high at 8.3 percent -- but as interest rates climb, the path to a so-called 'soft landing' is narrowing.

Update #1: Fed attacks inflation with another big hike and expects more (AP)  
Update #2: Fed goes big with latest rate hike; Powell vows to 'keep at it' (Reuters)   
WNU Editor: Bottom line. Unemployment rates are going to climb in 2023. Expect more interest rate hikes, but only after the mid-term elections. And as for inflation, that mess is only going to get worse .... Fed-funds rate could end up as high as 5%, says overseer of $1.3 trillion in assets (Market Watch).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Reserve traveled rate by 75 basis points on September 21 and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has forecast another 125 basis point hike before the end of the year.  If that happens, it will take the benchmark rate to 4.4% by the end of the year, which is significantly higher than the June estimate of 3.8%.  The Fed has also hinted that it only expects rate cuts to be considered in 2024.
The expectation of higher rates pushed the 2-year Treasury note to 4.1%, its highest level since 2007. This could attract several investors seeking safety in this uncertain macro environment.  Higher rates are also likely to reduce the appeal of risky assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies and may delay the start of a new uptrend.

In addition to more than 1,500 deaths, the disaster has caused dual health and food security crises. Zardari said Pakistan needs some $30 billion in aid and praised international efforts under way to offer help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Historically speaking when a country orders a military mobilization while fighting a war, its neighbors follow suit within a few hours if not days. But after Putin's announcement early today that he had ordered a partial mobilization, all that I have been hearing from the leaders of NATO and countries that border Russia is nothing but rhetoric denouncing this move (see above video). 
No calls to match Russia's partial mobilization. No calls to even declare a partial wartime industrial mobilization. Even Ukraine is silent on matching this Russian mobilization.

You can take this to the bank. 
If the West does nothing in the coming days to say that they will match Russia's mobilization efforts, this is going to cause panic in Ukraine that the West is now abandoning them. And in the eyes of the Kremlin, another example on how weak and ineffective the West has become. 
My prediction. 
The West (primarily the U.S.) will announce more troop deployments to eastern Europe, and more aid to Ukraine in the coming days. But it will fall short from what Ukraine needs, and it will certainly not match what Russia is going to do.]]></summary>

In a televised address on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of Russia's reservist forces to help boost the war effort in Ukraine.
The mobilization of these forces will serve to “protect our nation, its sovereignty and territorial integrity" as well as "ensure the security of our people and those in areas that have been liberated”, he said, the latter a reference to occupied areas of Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAO PAULO (Reuters) - At least nine people have died after part of a warehouse near the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo collapsed on Tuesday, during a visit by two congressional candidates.
Congressional candidates Jones Donizette and Ely Santos were visiting Brazilian container company Multiteiner when part of a concrete structure inside the warehouse collapsed over them and company employees.
Donizette said in a Facebook post that he and Santos had both been rescued, but a local fire department said at least nine people had died in the collapse.
The fire department added that 31 people had been rescued and 28 of these taken to nearby hospitals, though a spokesperson said rescue teams believed there could still be more people trapped under the debris.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former White House adviser Peter Navarro has recommended that former President Donald Trump's next national security adviser be a man who once held a "rape Melania" sign at a rally.
Politico correspondent Meridith McGraw noted on Wednesday that Navarro's included a list of potential members of a second Trump administration.

 
In his book, titled, "Taking Back Trump's America," Navarro suggests Gov. Ron DeSantis or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for vice president.
Under his plan, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro would be Attorney General and Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo would take the job of press secretary.
He asked Trump to consider right-wing activist Jack Posobiec for the position of National Security Adviser. 
In 2017, Posobiec reportedly tried to discredit liberal protesters by showing up to an event with a "rape Melania" sign, according to BuzzFeed News. He also pushed the false QAnon "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory that accused Hillary Clinton of running a sex trafficking ring from a restaurant.]]></summary>

Ukraine says Moscow’s move is ‘predictable’ as it is failing to achieve its objectives in the seven-month-old war. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a partial military mobilisation in Russia for the seven-month-old war in Ukraine, warning it is “not a bluff”.

He said Russia would use all the means at its disposal to protect its territory. 
Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu told state media that Putin’s decree would see 300,000 additional personnel called up to serve in Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine.

“This investigation of the 45th president of the United States is unprecedented and misguided,” James Trusty and Christopher Kise, attorneys for Trump, wrote in their response.  “In what is at its core a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control, the government unfairly seeks to criminalize the 45th president’s possession of his own presidential and personal records.”

Aerial images showed a devastating scene of dozens of black glossy mammals strewn across a long beach, stuck on the waterline where the frigid southern ocean meets the sand.
Locals covered survivors with blankets and doused them with buckets of water to keep them alive, as other whales nearby tried in vain to twitch free and yet more lay dead.
The whales were "stranded near Macquarie Harbour" said the state's Department of Natural Resources and Environment.
"It appears about half of the animals are alive."
Officials said marine conservation experts and staff with whale rescue gear were en route to the scene.

Julien Bayou was "suspended from his role" as co-president of the Greens' bloc in the National Assembly (lower house), the party said late Tuesday, after he was accused of psychologically abusing an ex-partner.
"We are a feminist party, and so we place ourselves at the service of women's testimony... we acknowledged that the only way to show we weren't pretending and weren't hiding was a temporary suspension," Sandra Regol, vice-president of the Green MPs' group, told broadcaster Franceinfo on Wednesday.

Both Russian president Vladimir Putin and Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu delivered speeches on Wednesday in the wake of announcements by the Donbass Republics as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions that they are planning to hold votes on joining Russia on September 23-27. 
In his TV address on Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that Russia was at war with the collective West rather than Ukraine.   
"In reality, we are fighting the collective West plus NATO. When we speak about it, we mean not only the weapons being supplied [to Kiev] in huge batches, but also about systems of communication and information processing systems,” Shoigu said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps more than any other French director, Jean-Jacques Annaud has always felt at home making films in Hollywood, with the American movie capital's flair for the epic and the spectacular.
Now, the 78-year-old Oscar-winner behind "The Name of the Rose," "Seven Years in Tibet" and "Enemy at the Gates" is returning to Tinseltown with his latest film, "Notre-Dame On Fire" ("Notre-Dame Brule") -- a thriller about the real-life blaze at the beloved cathedral in Paris.
Annaud spoke to AFP via phone from France's capital as organizers of next month's The American French Film Festival (TAFFF) announced Tuesday that his movie will be their opening night Los Angeles gala premiere.
"I'm close to Notre-Dame now and far away from Los Angeles. But part of my heart remains in Los Angeles," said Annaud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are set to blast off to the International Space Station Wednesday on a Russian-operated flight despite soaring tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
NASA's Frank Rubio and Russia's Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin are scheduled to take off from the Russia-leased Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1354 GMT, according to Russian space agency Roscosmos.
Rubio will become the first US astronaut to travel to the ISS on a Russian Soyuz rocket since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into pro-Western Ukraine on February 24.
In response, Western capitals including Washington have hit Moscow with unprecedented sanctions and bilateral ties have sunk to new lows. 
However, space has managed to remain an outlier of co…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurricane Fiona continued its slow and devastating march northward after slamming the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday and leaving a trail of destruction in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Wednesday morning that the storm had grown stronger, registering maximum wind speeds of 130 miles per hour (210 kilometers per hour) as it barreled toward Bermuda.
The NHC said Fiona was 105 miles (170 kilometers) north of Turks and Caicos and had been upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane, the second highest level on the Saffir-Simpson scale.
"Swells from Fiona are expected to reach Bermuda by early Thursday. The swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the NHC said in its latest advisory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, warning the West that if it continued what he called its "nuclear blackmail" that Moscow would respond with the might of all its vast arsenal.
"If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we use all available means to protect our people - this is not a bluff," Putin said in a televised address to the nation.
Putin said he had signed a decree on a partial mobilisation, which significantly escalates the conflict.
Putin said his aim was to "liberate" east Ukraine's Donbas region, and that most people in the regions under Russian control did not want to be ruled by Kyiv.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation.
The policy decision, due to be announced at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world's economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks as the value of the dollar soars.

Sputnik: China's Russian LNG Import Value Tripled in 2022 as Beijing Acts as Middleman to Sanctioning Nations 
Since the start of 2022, China has signed major deals with Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others to dramatically increase its importing and processing of petroleum products, including crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), as well as coal. 
According to newly released customs data, China increased its LNG imports from only two countries so far in 2022 - Qatar and Russia, the latter of which nearly tripled from 2021 numbers. At the same time, China’s LNG exports have increased, in part to offset the economic effects of Omicron-driven lockdowns.   
According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), which viewed the data, the value of LNG coming to China from Russia via pipelines in the first eight months of 2022 was nearly triple that seen in the previous year, amounting to $2.39 billion. In terms of volume, China’s overall LNG imports from Russia increased by 28.5% year-on-year; for imports from Qatar, they increased by 66.7%, or two-thirds.

How we got to an $850 billion Pentagon budget  
Situation The Senate might vote on the fiscal year 2023 military budget this month. Or it might not; nobody’s sure. What’s for certain is that the bill the Senate considers will have at least as much as $850 billion for the Pentagon. In other words, we’re staring down a $72 billion year-to-year increase in military spending with this legislation: The FY2022 version of the same bill (National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA) licensed $778 billion for the Pentagon.   
How we got to an $850 billion Pentagon budget 
In March, Joe Biden proposed increasing annual military spending by $35 billion—to $813 billion—as part of his FY2023 budget request. In June, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) added another $37 billion on top of that before advancing the $850 billion bill to the House floor for approval.

The State Department announced in August that it will no longer publish World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) reports, which have been released by the US government since the 1960s. 
The WMEATs detail US global military spending, arms transfers, and related data for each country in the world. 
The 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) included an amendment that repealed a 1994 provision requiring the State Department to publish a WMEAT each year.

“I assume that from the phase of a special military operation we are approaching a major war, and now the question is where are the borders and whether we will go after some time, maybe in a month or two, into a major world conflict the likes of which we haven’t had since World War II,” he said.

Business Insider: Russian stocks crash on signs Putin may escalate Ukraine war with military mobilization and Ukraine annexation 
* Russian stocks plunged Tuesday on signs that Moscow may escalate its war on Ukraine. 
* Lawmakers are advancing legislation to heighten punishments for military crimes, raising fears of full mobilization. 
* Russian officials also announced plans to hold sham annexation votes in occupied parts of Ukraine. 
Russian stocks fell Tuesday on signs that President Vladimir Putin could escalate his war on Ukraine after his military suffered a stunning rout earlier this month. 
New legislation in Russia's parliament would heighten punishment for military crimes, such as desertion, damage to military property, and insubordination, raising fears it could lead to a full mobilization later. 
Some hard-line lawmakers have been calling for an expansion of the military draft since it gave up huge swaths of territory in eastern Ukraine.

WNU Editor: This is a very bad sign. The people in the know are bailing out of the Russian stock markets. The last time the MOEX (link here) collapsed like this was 3 days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: REVEALED: President Biden was 14 rows back at the Queen's funeral because precedent demanded Commonwealth leaders and world royalty took closest seats 
* President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill sat 14 rows back in Westminster Abbey amid Queen Elizabeth's funeral 
* Biden was sat behind the President of Poland Andrzej Duda, while Jill was sat next to president of Switzerland 
* Their positioning raised eyebrows, but it has been revealed it is due to how royal protocol ranks world leaders 
* The couple left London for the United States just two hours after the service finished on Monday afternoon 
A quirk of royal protocol meant that US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were sat 14 rows back in Westminster Abbey at the Queen's funeral yesterday. 
There were raised eyebrows when Mr Biden and his wife were placed seven rows from the back in a service attended by around 2,000 world leaders, royals and foreign dignitaries. 
After arriving at the funeral in his motorcade while other world leaders took the bus, the leader of the free world was then placed behind Polish President Andrzej Duda.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: The Polish President was placed in front of President Biden. So much for the argument that protocol dictated where President Biden and the First Lady were seated. 
But the person who was really snubbed at the Queen's state funeralwas Prince Harry, even though the argument can be made that he helped cause it .... Prince Harry's uniform snub, invitation row and lonely flight to Balmoral (Mirror).]]></summary>

WNU Editor: From CNBC .... Russian President Vladimir Putin failed for unknown reasons to deliver a nationally televised speech that would have been his first since the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. 
Putin has postponed the speech, which was expected to discuss the situation in Ukraine, until Wednesday, according to a Telegram post by Sergei Markov, a former advisor to the Russian leader,

Russia's President Putin is set to give a major speech Tuesday evening (Moscow time) amid announcements by pro-Russian authorities in occupied regions of Ukraine that referendums to join the Russian Federation will be held in the coming days. 
Russian media is reporting within the last hours (machine translation): "President Vladimir Putin may speak on Tuesday, September 20, regarding referendums in the territories of the LPR, DPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. RBC was told about this by three sources close to the presidential administration. The speech is expected before the end of the day, what exactly the head of state will say is unknown to RBC's interlocutors." 
There are reports that Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu will also be by Putin's side, leading some pundits to speculate we are about to see a possible formal declaration of war and "national mobilization" of Russian society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reuters: German Producer Prices Post Surprise Record Jump in August 
BERLIN (Reuters) -German producer prices rose in August at their strongest rate since records began both in annual and monthly terms, driven mainly by soaring energy prices, raising the chances that headline inflation will surge even higher. 
Producer prices of industrial products increased by 45.8% on the same month last year, the Federal Statistical Office reported on Tuesday. Compared to July 2022, prices rose 7.9%, it added. 
The surge was considerably stronger than expected, with analysts having forecast a 37.1% year-on-year rise and a 1.6% monthly rise, according to a Reuters poll. 
In July, the year-on-year increase had been 37.2% and in June 32.7%.

Separatist authorities in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, as well as in the southern Kherson region, said they would hold the vote over five days beginning Friday this week and ending on Tuesday.
These territories are on the frontlines of a sweeping Ukrainian counter-offensive that has seen Kyiv's forces retake hundreds of towns and villages that had been controlled by Russia for months.

But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only making Europe stronger, Spanish PM tells POLITICO. 
NEW YORK — Russia is at war not only with Ukraine, but with the whole EU — and it's losing, according to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is “using energy as a war tool" because he is threatened by the EU's values, Sánchez told POLITICO in New York, where more than 150 heads of state and government are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly.

With maximum winds nearing 115 miles (185 kilometers) per hour, the storm is already bringing hurricane conditions to the British overseas territory and is expected to become even stronger, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
"Heavy rains around the center of Fiona impacts the Turks and Caicos through this afternoon with continued life-threatening flooding," the NHC said in an advisory, adding that the storm was expected to pass near the island chain within hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli researchers have found traces of opium in ceramic vessels in an ancient burial site dating back some 3,500 years.
It is the earliest known evidence of human opium use, according to a statement released on Tuesday by Tel Aviv University, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Israel Antiquities Authority.
The Canaanites used the psychoactive drug as an "offering for the dead," researchers believe, according to the statement.
The ceramic vessels containing opium were found during excavations at Tel Yehud, near Tel Aviv, where Canaanite tombs dating back to the 14th century BC are located.
"This exciting discovery confirms historical writings and archaeological hypotheses according to which opium and its trade played a central role in the cultures of the Near East," the joint statement said.
The vessels, some of which were made in Cyprus and some locally, resembled an opium poppy capsule in shape, according to the statement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Africa offers a vast underdeveloped market for global sports, with thousands of athletes ready to join international ranks if only there were major investment, industry leaders and stars say.
But more government and private-sector partnerships are needed to turbo-charge African sports and bring young players into top-tier leagues of football, basketball and even American football, participants at a business forum said Monday.
In the event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, NBA commissioner Adam Silver hailed Africa as bursting with sporting potential, noting that more than 10 percent of players in the world's premier basketball league were born in African countries or have African parents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 11 schoolchildren died in an air strike and firing on a Myanmar village, the UN children's agency said, an attack the country's junta said targeted rebels hiding in the area.
Myanmar has been in chaos since the military seized power in a coup in February last year, with nearly 2,300 civilians killed in a crackdown on dissent according to a local monitoring group.
The Sagaing region in the country's northwest has seen some of the fiercest fighting, and amid clashes between anti-coup fighters and the military, entire villages have been burned down.
The UN children's agency UNICEF condemned Friday's incident in Depeyin township in Sagaing.
"On 16 September, at least 11 children died in an air strike and indiscriminate fire in civilian areas," UNICEF said in a statement issued Monday.…]]></summary>

The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) will on Thursday give its judgment in the appeal by 91-year-old former head of state Khieu Samphan against his 2018 conviction for genocide and crimes against humanity.
It will be the last verdict given by the tribunal, which has cost more than $330 million and been dogged by complaints about the slowness of its work as well as allegations of interference by Cambodia's ruling party.

The Horn of Africa nation is on the brink of a second famine in just over a decade, enduring its worst drought in 40 years after failed rainy seasons since late 2020 wiped out crops and livestock.
With a fifth monsoon forecast to fail, the United Nations warned this month that time was running out to save lives as it urged donors to contribute more to the relief effort.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the situation was worse than the 2011 famine when 260,000 people died in the country, more than half of them children under the age of six.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SpaceX will apply for an exemption from US sanctions against Iran in a bid to offer its satellite internet service to the country, owner Elon Musk said on Monday.
"Starlink will apply for an exemption from sanctions against Iran," Musk said in response to a tweet from a science reporter.
Musk had initially announced that the Starlink satellite internet service had been made available on every continent -- "including Antarctica" -- with the company planning to launch up to 42,000 satellites to boost connectivity.
Iranian-born science journalist Erfan Kasraie had said on Twitter that bringing the service to Iran could be a "real game changer for the future" of the country, which elicited Musk's response. 
Launched at the end of 2020, Starlink offers high-speed broadband service to customers in areas poorly served by fixed and mobile terrestrial networks through a constellation of satellites in low earth orbit. 
The service received notoriety after supplying antennas and modems to the Ukrainian military to improve its communications capabilities in its war with Russia.
Starlink is monetized through the purchase of antennas, modems and subscriptions with rates that vary by country. 
Nearly 3,000 Starlink satellites have been deployed since 2019 and SpaceX is conducting about one launch a week, using its own Falcon 9 rockets to speed up its deployment.
Iran has been under a tightened US sanctions regime since former president Donald Trump terminated a 2015 agreement over its nuclear activities. 
While current President Joe Biden supports a renegotiation of the deal, Iranian insistence on long-term guarantees from Washington has stalled discussions. 
New rounds of sanctions were imposed on Iran this month after a Tehran-based company helped ship drones to Russia, and in response to a massive cyberattack targeting Albania in July allegedly carried out by Iran's intelligence ministry.

Whistleblowers were alarmed that the kingdom would use the technology for nuclear weapons and alerted Congress to the secret negotiations, resulting in a Congressional investigation. The White House did not cooperate with the investigation or share any requested documents.

PARIS (Reuters) -The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday against the parents of missing British toddler Madeleine McCann, saying that Portugal had given them a fair hearing in their libel battle against a former Portuguese policeman.
The police officer, Goncalo Amaral, who worked on the investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance in 2007, suggested in a book he authored, "Truth of the Lie", that the youngster’s parents had been involved.
They sued Amaral for libel. In 2015, a Portuguese court ruled in their favour, ordering Amaral to pay them damages. Two years later the ruling was reversed by Portugal's highest court.
The parents then appealed to the European court, arguing that their right to a fair trial, right to private family life and freedom of expr…]]></summary>
