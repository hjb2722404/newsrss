The president's job approval rating is 19 points underwater. 
President Joe Biden's job approval rating is 19 points underwater, his ratings for handling the economy and immigration are at career lows. A record number of Americans say they've become worse off under his presidency, three-quarters say he's too old for another term and Donald Trump is looking better in retrospect -- all severe challenges for Biden in his reelection campaign ahead. 
Forty-four percent of Americans in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll say they've gotten worse off financially under Biden's presidency, the most for any president in ABC/Post polls since 1986. Just 37% approve of his job performance, while 56% disapprove. Still fewer approve of Biden's performance on the economy, 30%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tensions between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hezbollah are at their highest level in years.

Both states believe the other is interfering with their territory.

Israel and Lebanon don’t have an agreed border but the United Nations patrols the boundary between the countries, known as the Blue Line.

The Israeli Defence Forces argue Hezbollah placing their yellow flag inside the military buffer zone and building lookout posts around 100 yards away is a violation of the agreement with the UN.

Israel is currently divided by government plans to overhaul its judicial system and one theory is Hezbollah sees this as an opportunity to test Israel.

Lebanon has also accused Israel of regularly flying through its airspace without permission to bomb Iranian targets in neighbouring Syria.]]></summary>

There was "shared intelligence among Five Eyes partners" that informed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's public allegation of a potential link between the government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen, United States Ambassador to Canada David Cohen confirmed to CTV News.

On Monday, Trudeau informed the House of Commons in a rare statement on a matter of national security that Canadian intelligence agencies were investigating "credible allegations" that agents of the Indian government were involved in the June death of prominent Canadian Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in B.C.

The crowd gathered in the city's Hyde Park railed against the proposal, which if it passes on October 14, would give Indigenous peoples the right to be consulted on policies that affect them, a measure dubbed the Voice.
"I'm here because I believe that everyone should be voting no. This Voice is causing so much division in the whole of Australia. And we don't need it," Faye Bevan, who attended the rally, told AFP.
Some protesters held signs with slogans such as "Vote no to the Voice of division" and "I don't trust the Voice, I'm voting no". Others carried placards referring to a range of conspiracy ideas, such as about human …]]></summary>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered an impassioned speech to parliamentarians Friday calling on Canada and other western allies to stick by his country through the long, bloody road to victory. 
He addressed a joint meeting of the Canadian Parliament Friday following meetings in the United States, where he appealed for more weapons and rebuked Russia before the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. 
"Life and justice must prevail," Zelenskyy told the House of Commons in a speech that received at least a dozen standing ovations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fire at a golf ball factory in Taiwan killed at least six people, three of them firefighters who died in an explosion, authorities said Saturday.
The fire, which began Friday evening and raged all night, injured more than 100 people, most of them workers, the Pingtung county government told local media.
One firefighter and three other people are missing.
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen visited the scene on Saturday morning and expressed condolences to the victims' families. She said an investigation into the cause of the tragedy is underway.
"I want to thank everyone for their hard work and please stay safe," Tsai told emergency response personnel.
She also stopped at the morgue to pay respects to the victims and visited the injured at a hospital.
An official with the Pingtung Fire Department told local media that chemical peroxide stored inside the factory could have been the cause of the one large and several smaller explosions.
Several people were trapped inside due to the blasts, which caused a section of the factory roof to collapse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis on Saturday hammered home his message that European governments must do more to care for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, saying "those who risk their lives at sea do not invade, they look for welcome".
Closing a meeting of bishops and young people from around the Mediterranean in French port city Marseille, he added that migration is "a reality of our times, a process that involves three continents around the Mediterranean and that must be governed with wise foresight, including a European response".
The pope's remarks -- given in front of President Emmanuel Macron, whose government plans tougher measures to control migration -- follow his insistence on arrival in France Friday that "people who are at risk of drowning when abandoned on the waves must be rescued".
The way Europe addresses large numbers of arrivals from the Middle East and North Africa has shot up the political agenda since last week, when thousands of people landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa over just a few days.
The pope also appeared to weigh in on French domestic politics, targeting two of Macron's projects in assisted dying and inscribing the right to abortion in the constitution.
Old people risk being "pushed aside, under the false pretences of a supposedly dignified and 'sweet' death that is more 'salty' than the waters of the sea," Francis warned.
He also spoke of "unborn children, rejected in the name of a false right to progress, which is instead a retreat into the selfish needs of the individual".]]></summary>

President Joe Biden has told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that the United States will provide a small number of long-range missiles to aid the war with Russia, three U.S. officials and a congressional official familiar with the discussions told NBC News on Friday. 
The officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, did not say when the missiles would be delivered or when a public announcement would be made. 
For months, Ukraine has asked for the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, which would give Kyiv the ability to strike targets from as far away as about 180 miles, hitting supply lines, railways, and command and control locations behind the Russian front lines.

“There will be another Republican presidential debate coming up and that will give an opportunity for somebody to lead the pack.

“I don’t have high hopes that any of them will be able to do that much better than they did in the first presidential debate.”]]></summary>

Indigenous leaders in bright feather headdresses and body paint exploded in celebration outside the high court building in Brasilia as Justice Luiz Fux became the sixth on the 11-member court to side with the native plaintiffs in the landmark case, giving them victory.
The judges voted one by one and in the end, the tally was a 9-2 win for Indigenous people opposed to the restriction.
"Justice is on the side of Indigenous peoples," said Joenia Wapichana, the head of the government's Indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI. "Today is a day to celebrate the death of the 'time-f…]]></summary>

Then it went up in flames, allegedly torched by land-grabbers trying to reclaim the territory for cattle pasture.
Launched in 2019 by environmental research group Rioterra, the reforestation project took 270 hectares (665 acres) of forest that had been razed by cattle ranching on a protected nature reserve in the northern state of Rondonia and replanted it with 360,000 trees.
The idea was ambitious, says Rioterra's project coordinator, Alexis Bastos: save a corner of the world's biggest rainforest, fighting climate change and creating green jobs along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump's purported comments about not wanting "to see" a severely wounded veteran have ignited conservative pundits and experts alike who say the former president crossed a line.
Trump, who is said to have snarled about seeing a severely wounded veteran sing at an event held during his presidency at a military base, is now being called out on his alleged comments by Gen. Mark Milley.
Now, other conservatives are joining Milley in criticizing the former president.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
Retired Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe said the incident reminds him "of the time Trump mocked a reporter with a physical disability and a speech impediment."
"Or when he dissed Senator McCain for having been captured in war and having endured torture," Tribe added. "Who revels in such cruelty? The Man Who Would Be King, that's who. No thank you!"
Conservative attorney and anti-Trump activist George Conway answered Tribe's question, saying, "Who is such a person? A malignant narcissist—a soulless, conscienceless, and morally bereft individual relentlessly driven by pathological levels of narcissism, sociopathy, sadism, and Machiavellinism."
In a separate post, Conway wrote, "There is no nice way to put it. P01135809 is pure scum," referring to Trump's assigned booking number from his recent arrest in Georgia.
Former GOP campaign consultant Rick Wilson also said, "Trump's loathing for an injured war hero speaks more volumes about his low, repulsive character than almost any of the other stories of his public or private behavior. I've read damn near every account of his degenerate, foul life, and this one still shocks."
Former Trump supporter David Weissman on Thursday added, "Trump continues to show his distain of American war heroes. This two time impeach and indicted a--hole is no patriot."]]></summary>

"I have decided to transition to the role of Chairman Emeritus at Fox and News," his letter, addressed to "Dear Colleagues," reads. One of his sons, Lachlan Murdoch, "will become sole Chairman of both companies."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
