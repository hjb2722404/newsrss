The Hill: House Democrats propose end to US troop protection in Gulf after OPEC cut 
Three House Democrats have introduced legislation to end U.S. troop protection in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in response to news this week that OPEC and its allies will slash oil production. 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which together comprise about 30 percent of global crude oil reserves, have some 5,000 U.S. troops stationed there. 
In addition to removing those troops and American missile defense systems from the two countries, the legislation introduced by Reps. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Susan Wild (D-Pa.) would move all U.S. technology and defense systems elsewhere in the region.

Quartz: OPEC’s oil cuts force the US to reconsider its foreign policy  
The US is accusing Saudi Arabia of "aligning with Russia" while seeking to restart Venezuelan oil production. 
OPEC+ announced it’ll slash output by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) on Wednesday (Oct. 5), the biggest cut since the pandemic started in 2020. The White House’s reaction was swift, calling the decision “shortsighted” and accusing the oil cartel of “aligning with Russia.” 
Saudi Arabia, which controls about one-third of OPEC’s oil reserves and is seen as a US ally, has not heeded president Joe Biden’s plea against taking such a drastic step. 
Three months ago, Biden traveled to the Middle Eastern nation to convince the kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, to pump more barrels.

Oil production cuts prompt backlash from Washington amid soaring energy inflation 
The White House has accused Opec+ of aligning with Russia after Saudi Arabia led the group in agreeing deep oil production cuts, prompting a backlash from countries battling surging energy inflation triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The Opec+ group said it would reduce production targets by 2mn barrels a day, equivalent to 2 per cent of global supply, following its first in-person meeting in two years in Vienna. The actual cut in output is likely to be closer to 1mn b/d as many weaker members have struggled to hit production targets in recent months.

WNU Editor: OPEC is seeing western countries impose oil sanctions, oil price caps, and hearing vows to transition away from fossil fuels. What also does not help is the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, an attack that many in OPEC see (rightly or wrongly) was done by the U.S. on a fellow energy producing state. Of course OPEC is going to circle the wagons and react in the way that they did. They see their economic survival at stake.]]></summary>

Washington Examiner: Biden says it 'remains to be seen' whether he'll meet Putin at G-20 summit

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre earlier declined to confirm a separate meeting between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also expected to attend the summit in Bali from Nov. 15-16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Taiwan Will Treat China Flights Into Airspace as 'First Strike' 
(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan warned it would treat any Chinese incursion into the island’s airspace as a “first strike,” as Taipei seeks to deter Beijing from ratcheting up military pressure around the island. 
Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told lawmakers in Taipei that the ministry was taking such incursions more seriously after a recent spate of closer flights by Chinese warplanes and drones.
Pressed on whether any warplane’s violation of Taiwan’s airspace would be viewed as a first strike, Chiu said, “Yes,” without elaborating what the response would be. 
“In the past, we said we won’t be the first to strike, which meant we won’t do it without them firing artillery shells or missiles, et cetera, first,” Chiu said Wednesday. 
“But now the definition has obviously changed, as China used means like drones. So we have adjusted, and will view any crossing of aircraft or vessels as a first strike.”

WASHINGTON — American officials are intensifying efforts to build a giant stockpile of weapons in Taiwan after studying recent naval and air force exercises by the Chinese military around the island, according to current and former officials. 
The exercises showed that China would probably blockade the island as a prelude to any attempted invasion, and Taiwan would have to hold out on its own until the United States or other nations intervened, if they decided to do that, the current and former officials say. 
But the effort to transform Taiwan into a weapons depot faces challenges. The United States and its allies have prioritized sending weapons to Ukraine, which is reducing those countries’ stockpiles, and arms makers are reluctant to open new production lines without a steady stream of long-term orders.

RT: Russia ready to send gas to EU via Nord Stream 2 — Moscow 
Supplies are possible through the undamaged string of the pipeline, according to Russia’s deputy prime minister   Russia is able to supply gas to Europe through a string of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that that was not damaged by the recent explosions, according to Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander Novak. 
The energy official described the blasts on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines as deliberate.  “Unfortunately, due to sabotage, one string [of Nord Stream 2] was damaged, and an examination is required to make further decisions on the fate of the string,” Novak was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti news agency. 
“As for the second string, it is ready, fully built, and if the necessary legal decisions are made by our European colleagues regarding the certification and removal of restrictions, I think Russia could provide appropriate supplies through this string of the gas pipeline in a short time,” he said.

Update: Russia ready to supply gas to EU over undamaged Nord Stream 2 string — Deputy PM (TASS).   
WNU Editor: I was stunned when I heard this news. Is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline actually two pipelines? Are there redundancies that we do not know about? 
I will be updating this news when more information becomes available, because I am confident that by the end of the day many governments/news organizations/and interest groups will want a clarification from the Russian government. 
But if this is true, it looks like those who are tried to sabotage the pipelines did so with incomplete information.]]></summary>

According to Maria Zakharova, someday the EU countries will have to admit that they were betrayed by their allies 
MOSCOW, October 5. /TASS/. The EU countries will have to face the truth and admit that they were betrayed by their allies in the situation involving the Nord Stream incidents, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel on Wednesday. 
She drew attention to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak’s statement that Russia was ready to supply gas through the undamaged Nord Stream 2 pipeline string.   
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: The above weekly Russian Foreign Ministry briefing begins at 1:07:35.. English translation available.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova's remarks reminds me of what a very good friend of mine told me once. People never learn until it hits their pocket-books. 
For Russia, these pipelines represent years of planning and work, $23 billion to build, and the expectation of almost a trillion dollars in revenues to Russia over the lifetime of this pipeline that is now lost forever. 
For Europe the loss and cost is even greater. Energy shortages. The astronomical cost to replace this energy. Economic dislocation/dis-industrialization. High inflation and a debt explosion that will cripple the budgets of governments/businesses/families. A social cost that is currently incalculable. 
Bottom line. 
This attack is easily going to cost Europe hundreds of billions of dollars, if not a trillion. 
So yes. The state actor(s) that did this, and the entire world outside of Canada and the U.S. know who that is, has betrayed the EU.]]></summary>

    Washington Examiner: WATCH: Biden drops F-bomb while touring Hurricane Ian devastation in Florida 
President Joe Biden dropped an F-bomb in a hot mic moment during a visit to hurricane-ravaged Florida on Wednesday. 
The candid moment came as Biden exchanged words with Fort Myers Beach Mayor Ray Murphy, who had just thanked the president for coming to the state. 
The two men were shaking hands, and Biden began to say something that was not quite clear in the audio. Several Twitter sleuths suggested he said, "No one f***s with a Biden," although the last word in particular was muffled.

   WNU Editor: For China and in particular Xi watchers this is a must read. I was in Fujian during the time when Xi was a party chief in one of this provinces regions, and during that time the talk in the universities was on the need to replicate the anti-communist movements in eastern Europe. Leading this discussion were those in the arts/culture/music/etc. (just like in eastern Europe at the same time). Hollywood is not the only cultural institution in the world that has a profound influence on it social and political culture. This is actually the case for must countries, and Xi obviously learned that lesson at a very young age when he saw what what was happening around him during that time. On a side note. Chinese President Xi's wife is a singer and musician.]]></summary>

The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic, as moving nuclear warheads closer to Russia would make them more vulnerable and less militarily useful, according to experts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox Business Anchor Maria Bartiromo spread a popular lie in conservative media when she told a guest that the Vice President Kamala Harris said hurricane relief will be distributed “based on race.”
Conservative media and political figures have spent days attacking Vice President Harris for a false claim that she advocates basing hurricane relief on racial equity.  The VP participated in a “Chat by the fireside with Priyanka Chopra JonasFriday, during which she was asked a long question that ended with a request in two parts:

This year’s Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, the date that symbolizes how far black women must work in the current year to match what white men did the year before, was September 21 ― more than a month later than last year.

Sputnik: Kremlin: Moscow Alarmed by Idea of Excluding Russia From Investigation on Nord Stream 
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Moscow is alarmed by the statements of Denmark and Sweden about the exclusion of Russia from the investigation of the situation of the incidents at the Nord Stream gas pipeline, the participation of the Russia should be mandatory, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. 
"So far, from the press conferences that were held in Denmark and Sweden we have heard such alarming statements that any cooperation with the Russian side is excluded. We will certainly wait for some clarifications on this; we believe, of course, that the participation of Russia in the inspection of damaged sites and in the investigation of what happened should be mandatory," Peskov told reporters, commenting on whether the ban of the Swedish coast guard on the movement of ships within a radius of 5 nautical miles from the accident on the pipeline will mean that this zone will be put pf reach for Gazprom and its contractors.

The US's decision to send more military aid to Ukraine "increases the danger of a direct military clash" between Russia and the West, Moscow has warned. 
Russia's ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said it was an "immediate threat" to Moscow, describing the US as "a participant of the conflict". 
Earlier, the US announced another $625m (£547m) in military aid to Ukraine. 
Advanced US weaponry has been credited with helping Ukraine build momentum against occupying Russian forces. 
Ukrainian troops have made significant advances in the country's north-east and south in recent weeks. 
The latest US hardware includes another four of the high-precision Himars multiple rocket systems.

Defense News: US Marines warn against Navy’s FY24 decommission scheme 
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Navy has spent more than four years repairing one of its amphibious ships, blowing past its budget by at least $99 million. Yet, the ship is still not ready to deploy. 
After pouring nearly $300 million into its repairs, the service says it would prefer to simply decommission the ship and move on. 
In fact, the Navy would like to decommission the nine other vessels in this class of amphibious dock landing ships, all of which need significant repairs. Some have more than a decade of planned service life left, but the Navy says it would rather spend its money on other capabilities than attempt to repair them. 
But the Navy isn’t the primary user of these amphibious platforms. The Marine Corps relies on these ships to carry its Marine expeditionary units, which are considered the nation’s crisis response force. But the Corps’ ability to keep forces spread across the globe and quickly react is at risk.

Warzone/The Drive: Ballistic Missile Failure Caused Explosion At South Korean Airbase (Updated) 
The explosion occurred during a South Korean Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile launch intended as a response to North Korea’s own launch. 
The office of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff has confirmed that a Hyunmoo-2 short-range ballistic missile launch failed at a base in the east coast city of Gangneung late on Oct. 4, according to a report from NK News. The South Korean military said there were no casualties from the incident, which caused a large fire.
"The failed launch came during combined US-ROK surface-to-surface missile drills conducted in response to North Korea's intermediate-range ballistic missile test over Japan earlier Tuesday," a statement from what is officially called the Republic of Korea's (ROK) Joint Chiefs of Staff said, according to NK News. "The US and ROK each successfully fired 2 ATACMS [Army Tactical Missile System short-range ballistic missiles] at targets in the sea."

WASHINGTON — The Army fell about 15,000 soldiers — or 25% — short of its recruitment goal this year, officials confirmed Friday, despite a frantic effort to make up the widely expected gap in a year when all the military services struggled in a tight jobs market to find young people willing and fit to enlist. 
While the Army was the only service that didn't meet its target, all of the others had to dig deep into their pools of delayed entry applicants, which will put them behind as they begin the next recruiting year on Saturday. 
The worsening problem stirs debate about whether America's fighting force should be restructured or reduced in size if the services can't recruit enough, and could also put added pressure on the National Guard and Reserve to help meet mission requirements.

The US Navy’s newest and most advanced aircraft carrier left on its first deployment Tuesday from Norfolk, Virginia, designed to put the ship through its paces and exercise with allies in North America and Europe. 
The USS Gerald Ford is the first new aircraft carrier designed in “over 40 years,” according to the US Navy. 
The carrier’s construction formally began in November 2009 and it was commissioned in 2017 by former President Donald Trump, according to a US Navy release. 
The ship is the first Ford-class aircraft carrier. The Navy has begun construction on the next two Ford-class carriers, the USS Kennedy and the USS Enterprise.

Each country fired two ground-to-air missiles in a show of strength after North Korea conducted its farthest-ever missile test, which caused evacuations in Japan. 
South Korea and the United States fired four missiles into the Sea of Japan, Seoul said on Wednesday, a day after North Korea launched an intermediate-range missile over Japan for the first time in five years. 
The two countries each fired a pair of US-made ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles, according to a statement. 
The South Korean military said the launches were a retaliation to Pyongyang's farthest-ever missile test. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol had previously vowed a "stern response" against the North.

* Power grid collapse leads to blackouts in 75-80% Bangladesh 
* Authorities working to restore power, investigating cause 
* Government had rationed some gas due to high global prices 
DHAKA, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Large swathes of Bangladesh were left without electricity on Tuesday after a grid failure, a government official said, adding that authorities were working to gradually restore power supply in the country of 168 million people. 
The country's power grid malfunctioned at around 2 p.m. (0800 GMT) on Tuesday, leading to blackouts across 75-80% of the Bangladesh, Bangladesh Power Development Board official Shameem Hasan told Reuters. 
An investigation was underway to ascertain the reason for the grid's collapse and power had been restored in 45% of the regions hit by the blackouts, he said. By nightfall, it was still not clear when power would be fully restored.

WNU Editor: As of this posting, the power is still off for more than half of the country. As to what caused the grid collapse. Much of the country's power-grid uses natural gas, and with sky-high prices there has been cutbacks. It looks like the cutbacks were just too much for the grid.

He said there is a claim put forward by the Republican Party that Alphabet, Google and Gmail are “deliberately” sending their fundraising messages “off to the spam folder”. 

“Send them off into the trash file,” Mr Murray said. 

“This means that they believe that literally millions of people have not been getting the message to donate to Republicans or what the issues were or the endless failures of the mainstream media, to tell the truth about the economy under Joe Biden.”]]></summary>

Reuters: Nord Stream operators: Authorities won't allow us to inspect damaged pipelines 
MOSCOW, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The operators of two Baltic Sea gas pipelines that linked Russia and Germany until they both sprang major leaks last week said they were unable to inspect the damaged sections because of restrictions imposed by Danish and Swedish authorities. 
Europe is investigating what caused three pipelines in the Nord Stream network to burst in an act of suspected sabotage near Swedish and Danish waters that Moscow quickly sought to pin on the West, suggesting the United States stood to gain. 
Nord Stream 2 AG, Switzerland-based operator of that gas pipeline, said on Tuesday it will examine the condition of the leaking pipelines once a police investigation of the "crime scene" is completed and a cordon is lifted.

WNU Editor: The reason being given on why the operators cannot examine their pipelines is that they do not have the right permits?!?!?!? .... Nord Stream operator reports it cannot inspect leaks due to lack of permits (News 360). And the news just get better. Once the paperwork has been forwarded, it will take 30 days (or more) before approval?!?!?!?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: Heaven help those who go against the main stream media narrative. But Colombia Profesor Jeffrey Sachs is correct that all the people that he talks to around the world are convinced that the US is responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline attacks. I am getting the same response from all of my friends and contacts outside of Canada and the U.S.. After-all .... who benefits the most from this attack? And when you add in earlier promises made by President Biden and State Department official Victoria Nuland that the US would stop the Nord Stream pipelines if Russia invades Ukraine, the evidence is building. 
A prediction. We will eventually find out in the future on who was responsible for this attack. I give it two or three years when the truth comes out.
 Update: Yup. If you go against the narrative, you must be influenced by the Kremlin .... U.S. podcasters spread Kremlin narratives on Nord Stream sabotage (Brookings).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.
Lead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.
Gahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.
"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil," he said of their 19th tour.
The band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words "Berlin 4.10.22".
Credited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, "Spirit", in 2017. "Memento Mori" will be their 15th studio record.
Depeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.
The band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as "Personal Jesus", "People Are People" and "Enjoy the Silence".
The group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.

Polish demands for trillions in World War II reparations for damages are a non-starter, said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock during a visit to Warsaw on Tuesday.
The question of reparations is closed, as far as the German government is concerned, the Green Party politician said on Tuesday, following consultations with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau.
Still, "Germany stands by its historical responsibility without any ifs and buts," Baerbock said. "It remains our eternal task to remember the millionfold suffering German inflicted on Poland."

That is no mean feat, given that the Ethereum blockchain was burning through about as much electricity as New Zealand.
Sceptics had expected glitches with the upgrade, known as "the merge", but it ended up being a "rather boring event", according to Alex de Vries of the Free University in Amsterdam.
De Vries, whose Digiconomist website models the energy use of Bitcoin and Ethereum, said consumption had indeed plummeted by more than 99 percent on Ethereum.
Moritz Platt, a researcher specializing in crypto at King's College London, said the 99 percent estimates were realistic and heralded a …]]></summary>

Now, 10 years into President Xi Jinping's rule, community organizations such as Charles's have been dismantled and hopes of a rebirth crushed.
Charles has fled China and several of his activist friends are in jail.
"After 2015, the whole of civil society began to collapse and become fragmented," he told AFP, using a pseudonym for safety reasons.
Xi, on the brink of securing a third term at the apex of the world's most populous country, has overseen a decade in which civil society movements, an emergent independent media and academic freedoms have been all but destroyed.

Many of Australia's species are clinging to existence, their habitats shrinking from human activity and extreme events such as the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires, wildlife groups say.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government announced a new 10-year scheme to try and halt the slide into extinction of 110 "priority species" and shield 20 "priority places" from further degradation.
It aims to prevent any new extinctions of plants and animals while conserving at least 30 percent of Australia's land mass.

"The deserts and mountains of Saudi Arabia will soon be a playground for winter sports," the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said in a statement on the decision made during its general assembly meeting in Phnom Penh.
The Saudi bid was "unanimously approved", the statement said, noting that the megacity known as NEOM will be the first West Asian city to host the event.
First announced in 2017, NEOM has consistently raised eyebrows for proposed flourishes like flying taxis and robot maids, even as architects and economists have questioned its feasibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for "experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science", the award-giving body said on Tuesday.
The more than century-old prize, worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($902,315), is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week after Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the prize for Physiology or Medicine on Monday.
The prestigious prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in the will of Alfred Nobel, who made a fortune from his invention of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 with a some interruptions, primarily the two world wars.
The physics prize has often taken centre stage among the awards, featuring household names of science such as Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie, and rewarding breakthroughs that have reshaped how we see the world.
Last year, scientists Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi shared the physics prize for their work on
complex physical systems such as Earth's changing climate, key in understanding global warming.
Announced over consecutive weekdays in early October, the physics prize announcement will be followed by awards for chemistry, literature, peace and economics, the latter added in 1969 to the original line-up.

The Japanese government warned citizens to take cover as the missile appeared to have flown over and past its territory before falling into the Pacific Ocean.
It was the first North Korean missile to follow such a trajectory since 2017, and Tokyo said its 4,600 km (2,850 miles) range may have been the longest distance travelled for a North Korean test flight, which are more often "lofted" higher into space to avoid flying over neighboring countries.
The latest launch was Pyongyang's fifth in 10 days, amid military muscle-flexing by the United States, South Korea, and Japa…]]></summary>

The agency that manages Ecuador's prisons, SNAI, gave the death toll in a statement which also said 21 people were injured in the clashes between inmates.
It had earlier announced that tactical units conducted operations to regain control of the facility, located in the Ecuadoran city of Latacunga.
The prison houses about 4,300 prisoners and is one of the largest in the country.
Violence in Ecuador's prisons, where drug gangs vie for power, is often carried out with knives and sometimes involves beheadings. The violence has left more than 400 prisoners dead since February 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday accused arch-foes the United States and Israel of fomenting the wave of nationwide unrest sparked by outrage over the death of Mahsa Amini.
"I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime, as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad," the supreme leader said.
Amini, 22, was pronounced dead on September 16, days after the notorious morality police detained the Kurdish Iranian for allegedly breaching rules forcing women to wear hijab headscarves and modest clothes.
Anger over Amini's death has sparked the biggest wave of protests to rock the Islamic republic in almost three years, which saw security forces in Tehran crack down on hund…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hurricane Orlene made landfall on Monday on Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and a risk of flooding and landslides, forecasters said.
Orlene came ashore south of the beachside city of Mazatlan in Sinaloa state as a Category One hurricane -- the weakest on a scale of five.
At 1500 GMT, the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour and moving inland toward the northeast, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
Boats had been brought ashore in Mazatlan ahead of Orlene's arrival, and businesses boarded up windows and laid down sandbags in case of flooding.
Orlene had strengthened to a powerful Category 4 hurricane on Sunday in the Pacific, prompting warnings for inhabitants of at-risk areas to take refuge in temporary shelters.
But the storm gradually lost strength as it approached the coast and was expected to quickly lose its hurricane force after making landfall.
"Rapid weakening is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours as Orlene moves inland," the NHC said.
"Orlene is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm by this afternoon, and dissipate tonight or early Tuesday," it added.
Tropical cyclones hit Mexico every year on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts, usually between May and November.
In October 1997, Hurricane Paulina hit Mexico's Pacific coast as a Category 4 storm, leaving more than 200 dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain on Monday scrapped plans to axe its top income tax rate just 10 days after a debt-driven budget sparked turmoil on markets and fierce criticism during a cost-of-living crisis.
On the second day of the ruling Conservative Party's annual conference, finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted he was "not proceeding" with the removal of the top 45-percent income tax rate, adding it had become a "distraction".
The announcement also marked the first major policy U-turn under British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who took office less than one month ago.
"It is clear that the abolition of the 45p tax rate has become a distraction from our overriding mission to tackle the challenges facing our country. As a result, I'm announcing we are not proceeding with the abolition of the ... rate.
"We get it, and we have listened."
The announcement also came after former cabinet ministers Grant Shapps and Michael Gove voiced opposition over unfunded tax cuts unveiled by Kwarteng in his controversial mini-budget on September 23.
Kwarteng had proposed to remove the 45-percent rate applied to Britons earning more than £150,000 ($167,400) per year.
The so-called mini budget had sent the pound plunging to a record dollar low and sent bond yields spiking on fears of a borrowing splurge.
The budget included a costly freeze on energy bills for individuals and businesses, in an attempt to cushion fallout from key gas producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Brazil’s presidential race will need to go to an October 30th second round after former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fell short of the 50%+1 he needed to avoid a run-off with extremist incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.
Brazilians voted Sunday in a historic presidential election, with leftist front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who led in the pre-election polls, winning but still short of the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff election.

There are fears the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro will not accept a defeat after he warned that he will only leave office if he's "killed, jailed, or victorious" and has called on his base to "go to war" if the vote is "stolen."
Bolsonaro took an early lead as results started coming in but in 2014, when Lula's leftist party last won a presidential election, it only took the lead after two hours of vote counting. Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.
Lula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.

With 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:

With 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:

EARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:


Lula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.
To win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.
Polls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.

STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) -Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for discoveries that underpin our understanding of how modern day humans evolved from extinct ancestors.
The prize, arguably among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute and is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($900,357).
It is the first of this year's batch of prizes. The Award committee officially gave Paabo the prize for "discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution."

Washington has historically maintained a policy of "strategic ambiguity" on whether it would intervene militarily if Taiwan were attacked by China.
Asked in an interview with CBS last month whether US troops would defend Taiwan, Biden said "yes," if it were "an unprecedented attack."
Austin was asked by CNN host Fareed Zakaria whether the US military was preparing to send troops to Taiwan in line with Biden's comments, but he declined to answer directly.
