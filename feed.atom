Mr Clennell said the two leaders “upgraded the security relationship” with an agreement that includes that Japanese troops for the first time can train on Australian soil and vice versa. 

“Of course, China looms largest in all of that. Perth was chosen for the bilateral meeting because WA is important to Japan with its supplies of natural resources including gas and iron ore. 

“It is also, of course, after a thumping election result for Labor there, an important political area for the Prime Minister, who over the weekend attended the local telethon. An energy security agreement was also signed between the two leaders."]]></summary>

Moscow-installed authorities urged residents in the southern Kherson region -- which the Kremlin claims to have annexed -- to leave the main city "immediately" in the face of Kyiv's advancing counter-offensive. 
"Due to the tense situation on the front, the increased danger of mass shelling of the city and the threat of terrorist attacks, all civilians must immediately leave the city and cross to the left bank of the Dnipro river," the region's Russian-installed authorities said on social media on Saturday. 
A Moscow-installed official in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, told the Russian news agency Interfax that around 25,000 people had made the crossing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DW: Germany: Thousands protest high energy costs in 6 cities 
Protesters gathered in six German cities on Saturday under a motto roughly translating as "together through the crisis — ensure social security and end fossil fuel dependence," demanding more social justice and sustainability as inflation and rising gas prices start to bite in Germany. 
Organizers like the major trade union ver.di and the German branch of Greenpeace estimated turnout at around 24,000 — including around 6,000 in Berlin, 5,000 in Düsseldorf and Frankfurt, and 4,000 in Stuttgart, with protests also taking place in Hanover and Dresden. 
Police estimates on turnout were often far lower, however, at 1,800 in Berlin, 1,500 in Hanover, 2,300 in Düsseldorf and 2,700 in Frankfurt. 
Police also reported that the demonstrations were calm and peaceful.

Pakistan has been removed from an international terrorism-financing watch list, the head of the international organization that makes the list said. 
The decision was announced on October 21 at the end of a two-day meeting in Paris of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) at which the organization removed Pakistan from its so-called "gray list" of countries that do not take full measures to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. 
The FATF welcomed “Pakistan’s significant progress in improving" its anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing policies.

Analysis reveals cost of shooting down cheap drones, but experts say deployment is sign of Moscow’s weakness 
The cost to Ukraine of downing the “kamikaze” drones being fired at its cities vastly exceeds the sums paid by Russia in sourcing and launching the cheap Iranian-made technology, analysis suggests. 
A total of 161 Shahed-136 drones, one larger Shahed-129 and four even larger unmanned attack vehicles known as Mohajer-6s have been shot down by Ukrainian air defences in the last month. 
With the price of the Iranian-made Shahed-136s standing at €20,000 to €50,000 for each vehicle, the total cost to Russia of the failed drone attacks unleashed on Ukraine in recent weeks is estimated by military analysts at the NGO Molfar to be between $11.66m (£10.36m) and $17.9m (£15.9m).

WNU Editor: Drone and missile strikes have knocked out almost 40% of Ukraine's electrical grid in one week. And while Ukraine is claiming that they are shooting down a majority of these drones, the ones that are making through are causing massive damage.

Update #2: EU to give 18B euros to Kyiv next year to help run Ukraine (Reuters)   
WNU Editor: This EU financial assistance does not include military assistance. 
So why is the EU rushing to provide this aid now for 2023 instead of next year? 
My gut tells me that these EU leaders know that this winter is going to be horrendous for many in the EU. 
High energy prices (if you can get a reliable source of energy). Inflation. Shortages. Business closures. High unemployment. High debt loads for governments, businesses, and individuals. 
There will be no appetite among Europeans to provide aid to Ukraine when so many are suffering. Hence the rush to do it now.]]></summary>

Reports The War Zone obtained reveal new details about swarming incidents off Southern California in 2019 and many more across the Pacific. 
The U.S. Navy has released 35 brief reports regarding various incidents involving its ships and facilities and unidentified small uncrewed aircraft systems, or sUASs, across the entire span of the Pacific between 2016 and 2021. Not all of the reports appear to be notable, and some are clearly innocuous, but others absolutely provide additional evidence of concerning trends that The War Zone has been actively reporting on in recent years. Among the newly released reports, for instance, is one that covers a worrying encounter that the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Paul Hamilton had with four drones in the Pacific off the coast of southern California in 2019, which you can read more about in our past reporting here.   
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: There definitely is something out there .... EXCLUSIVE: Dramatic videos of UFOs over the Pacific are revealed, as expert pilots describe seeing bright lights moving in 'race track' circles over the summer - but say their employers told them to keep quiet (Daily Mail). 
The above Joe Rogan video is a must see. 
Former US F-18 Navy pilot Ryan Graves gives his account on UFO encounters. He gives a few details that are fascinating to listen to. That some of these UFOs are spherical in shape, translucent, and in the sphere is a grayish-black cube?!?!? They can travel at very high altitudes at mach .6 to .7.. They were spotted all the time. Had the capability to move in a "race track" circle (for 13 hours!!!!). But the big revelation (for me) is that they have the capability to stay stationary in one spot even at a high altitude where the winds are intense (130mph to 140mph).]]></summary>

Space News: Space Force briefing on military space race catches Jeff Bezos’ attention 
WASHINGTON — U.S. Space Systems Command officials earlier this month gave an unclassified briefing to Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos on the power competition taking place in the space domain. 
Executives from the space company Blue Origin heard the briefing in September at a Space Systems Command industry meeting in Los Angeles. “The Blue Origin team was so impressed that they requested that SSC brief Jeff Bezos,” Col. Joseph Roth, the command’s director of innovation and prototyping, said Oct. 19 at the Space Industry Days conference hosted by AFCEA Los Angeles. 
The briefing was conducted by SMSgt. Ron Lerch, senior enlisted leader of Space Systems Command’s intelligence directorate.

Would Russia launch a small nuke? Look to the US’s own troubled nuclear history. 
 Russia has about 2,000 small nuclear weapons, known as tactical nukes. But most of the world probably hadn’t been thinking about them until Vladimir Putin reached new desperate lows in the invasion of Ukraine. “This is not a bluff,” he said upon the mass mobilization of Russian troops last month. “And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them.”

More than half of all registered voters see the mainstream media as a threat to American democracy, according to a new poll. 
A New York Times-Siena College poll published Tuesday found 59 percent of voters view the media as a “major threat to democracy,” while 25 percent said the press is a “minor threat” and only 15 percent said it poses no threat. 
The divide fell sharply along partisan lines, with 87 percent of voters who supported former President Trump in 2020 indicating they view the media is a major threat, while 33 percent of Biden voters during that election cycle said the same thing.

Exactly two years ago, on October 19, 2020, one of the dirtiest tricks in electoral history was played on the American people by 51 former intelligence officials, who used the false alarm of “Russian interference” to stop Donald Trump winning a second term as president. 
Using the institutional weight of their former esteemed roles, they signed a dishonest letter to mislead voters 15 days before the election, claiming that material from Hunter Biden’s laptop published by the New York Post “has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.”

The above interview with one of the signatories gives a very good insight on how they are rationalizing this. The commentary below sums up why it is BS.]]></summary>

Reuters: U.S. considering joint weapons production with Taiwan 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government is considering a plan to jointly produce weapons with Taiwan, a business lobby said on Wednesday, an initiative intended to speed up arms transfers to bolster Taipei's deterrence against China. 
U.S. presidents have approved more than $20 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan since 2017 as China has ramped up military pressure on the democratically-governed island Beijing claims as its own territory. 
But Taiwan and the U.S. Congress have warned of delivery delays because of supply chain difficulties and backlogs caused by increased demand for some systems due to the war in Ukraine. 
"It's right at the beginning of the process," Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which counts numerous U.S. defense contractors as members, said of the plan.

The Intercept: Saudis Sought Oil Production Cut So Deep It Surprised Even Russia  
OPEC+ slashed oil production following a Saudi pressure campaign that experts say aims to hurt Democrats in the midterms. 
The Saudi-led oil cartel OPEC+’s announcement earlier this month that it was cutting 2 million barrels of oil per day — a move that would drive up the price of oil just a month before midterm elections — rankled Democrats in Washington. They accused Riyadh of aligning itself with Russia, another powerful member of OPEC+, which would indeed profit off the move. “What Saudi Arabia did to help Putin continue to wage his despicable, vicious war against Ukraine will long be remembered by Americans,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
But Saudi Arabia actually pushed to cut oil production twice as much as Russian President Vladimir Putin, surprising the Russians, two Saudi sources with knowledge of the negotiations told The Intercept, suggesting that Riyadh’s motives run deeper than what top Democrats want to admit. The sources requested anonymity, fearing reprisal by the Saudi government.

WNU Editor: I agree with the above analysis that the Saudis want to hurt the Democrats in the midterms, and it looks like they will succeed. 
Here is a prediction. If the US Democrats lose control of the Senate and House, they will blame the Saudis. 
On a side note. Expect even higher gas prices next month .... Oil Will Surge By More Than $30/bbl To "Well Over $100" After The Midterms (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>

The Navy submarine visit in the Arabian Sea comes amid tensions with Pakistan 
The commander of the Defense Department's Central Command (CENTCOM) visited a nuclear submarine in international waters Wednesday in a possible move designed to send a message to adversaries in the region.

During the visit, he received a demonstration of the vessel's capabilities, which operates globally under the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).

Daily Mail: Mystery of Russia's 'missing' nuclear tests: No sign of long-awaited drills amid claims Putin's atomic plans are being 'disrupted' from within with top brass 'sabotaging plans to use nuclear weapons' 
* Russia was expected to carry out long-awaited 'Grom' nuclear drills this week 
* Air alerts were put out over swathes of Arctic suggesting long-range missiles and potentially nuclear bombs were going to be tested 
* But so far there is no sign of drills taking place and alert areas have been silent 
* Russian professor has claimed Putin's tests are being 'disrupted' from within 
Mystery surrounds Russian nuclear tests that were expected to take this week and never materialised, amid claims they are being 'disrupted' from within. 
Moscow typically carries out large-scale atomic drills dubbed 'Grom' at this time of year and in recent days had issued a number of airspace alerts over its usual testing grounds - heavily suggesting they would be going ahead. 
But the US says it has received no alert from Moscow about any upcoming tests and there has been no official word from the Kremlin explaining their absence, with the air alerts due to expire Saturday.

Wall Street Journal: China's Military Is Catching Up to the U.S. Is It Ready for Battle?  
China’s military is emerging as a true competitor to the U.S. under Xi Jinping. 
The People’s Liberation Army now has hypersonic missiles that evade most defenses, a technology the U.S. is still developing. Its attack drones can swarm to paralyze communications networks. China’s naval ships outnumber America’s, and it launched its third aircraft carrier this summer, the first to be designed and built in the country. Its defense budget is second only to the U.S.’s. China’s military has more serving members, at around 2 million, compared with just under 1.4 million in the U.S. 
The question for Mr. Xi, which he has raised in public, is whether those forces are ready for battle. 
China hasn’t fought a war since a brief border clash with Vietnam in 1979. Unlike American forces, who have fought for most of the past two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan, China’s service members have virtually no combat experience—which some Chinese leaders have referred to as a “peace disease.” Finding a solution short of actual war has been a priority for Mr. Xi, especially as he seeks to prepare the country for a potential showdown with the U.S.

 WNU Editor: I know my Chinese friends firmly believe that China's military capabilities now far exceed what the U.S. has in Asia. As to becoming a global military power equal to the U.S.. Quoting the above article .... 
.... Mr. Xi’s ambition, according to China’s most recent defense white paper, is to complete a modernization of the military by 2035 and turn it into a “world-class force” by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party’s founding.]]></summary>

WASHINGTON — Iran has sent trainers to occupied Ukraine to help Russians overcome problems with the fleet of drones that they purchased from Tehran, according to current and former U.S. officials briefed on the classified intelligence, a further signal of the growing closeness between Iran and Russia since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The Iranian trainers are operating from a Russian military base in Crimea where many of the drones have been based since being delivered from Iran. The trainers are from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a branch of the Iranian military designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.

Washington Post: U.S. has viewed wreckage of kamikaze drones Russia used in Ukraine 
The U.S. government has examined the wreckage of Iranian-made drones shot down in Ukraine, deepening its insight into the unmanned craft that Russia has launched in a spate of kamikaze attacks on the country’s critical infrastructure, according to two U.S. officials. 
Information about the drones’ structure and technology could prove crucial in helping the United States and its Ukrainian allies better identify and ultimately defeat them before they can reach their targets. Officials said the process has been used in the past to study weaponry deployed by Iran’s proxies in conflicts in the Middle East. People interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[German fintech N26, valued at $9 billion, has launched crypto trading on its mobile app.  Starting in Austria and rolling out to other countries in the coming months, N26 Crypto will allow its customers to buy and sell 200 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).
The Berlin-based fintech announcement the October 20 launch in Austria responds to “strong local demand,” with 40% of N26 users actively trading or having expressed an interest in investing in cryptocurrencies.  N26 plans to roll out its crypto trading service to other key markets over the next 6 months. 
N26 customers with a verified identity can access N26 Crypto from the “Trading” section of the new “Finances” tab of their N26 app.  Thus, they can buy crypto from their fiat bank account.  Transaction fees are set at 1.5% for BTC and 2.5% for other currencies for regular accounts, with some additional discounts for N26 metal card holders.

According to N26 co-founder and co-CEO Valentin Stalf, the company sees its new product as an entry point for a new generation of investors, who are interested in digital assets despite recent market turmoil: 

“While cryptocurrencies have seen a decline in value over the past year, they remain a demanded and attractive asset class for investors and a growing part of the financial system.”

The platform is run in partnership with Vienna-based Bitpanda GmbH, which handles trade execution and coin custody. 
In November 2021, N26 announced its release of the American market and intends to focus exclusively on the European market.  However, the company has also encountered problems in Europe, with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) imposing the new customer cap on the company in May 2021.

Deadly clashes between police and demonstrators protesting at the military’s grip on power erupted in Chad on Thursday, claiming at least 50 lives, including members of the security forces. The United Nations condemned the lethal use of force against the protesters and demanded a probe be launched. 
Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in the capital N’Djamena and elsewhere to mark the date when the military had initially promised to hand over power—a period that has been extended for another two years.

Truss abandoned her signature tax proposal, but it wasn’t enough to help her stay in power.
 The United Kingdom, not to mention the Conservative Party currently running it, is having a bumpy fall. So bumpy, in fact, that new prime minister Liz Truss has announced she will resign, after only six weeks in office. 
“I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected,” she said Thursday in brief remarks.
Truss’s rapid fall from power came after she introduced Trussonomics, a plan for massive tax cuts aimed at Britain’s wealthiest, and then reversed course and apologized for all the economic turmoil the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]  When it comes to shaping behaviors and fostering positive learning, the space in which students do their learning can have a profound impact on their learning outcomes. This philosophy was brought to life at a recent “Girls Go Tech” workshop co-hosted by The Women’s Foundation, an NGO dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls in Hong Kong, and Steelcase; an industry leader in creating great experiences in the Learning and Work Spaces through architecture, technology, furniture and design services.  Launched in 2015, the “Girls Go Tech” (GGT) programme was put together by The Women’s Foundation to encourage female secondary school students from underprivileged backgrounds to pursue traditionally male-dominated STEM-related subjects. By connecting the students to various opportunities and stakeholders in the community, students are exposed to STEM subject matters and are given a hands-on opportunity to develop their self-confidence, problem solving skills, creativity and collaboration in order to help maximise their career options while achieving their academic and career goals.   The most recent of these events was a visit hosted by Steelcase at their WorkLife space in Central, where students were invited to put their thinking caps on to conceptualize how to use technology and space to create a design learning space that offered better learning experiences.     “Many of these girls lack confidence because they don’t have a chance at these experiences, so for some of our participants, this could be the first time they have even been to Central to go to a corporate partner’s office,” explained Connie Cheung, Programme Director for The Women’s Foundation. “This is a real eye-opening opportunity for them to visualize how technology is used in different industries.”   Of course, when it comes to nurturing a design thinking approach amongst students, there is no better place to experience this than at Steelcase’s very own…]]></summary>

* U.S. weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, helped by higher sales in its aeronautics unit which makes the F-35 fighter jet.

WASHINGTON - U.S. weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, helped by higher sales in its aeronautics unit, which makes the F-35 fighter jet, as the company sees demand for arms increasing after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Shares were up as much as 3.8% to $412.56 during morning trading in New York  The maker of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers and their ammunition, which Ukraine is using to beat back Russia’s incursion, saw lower profit margins compared with the same quarter a year ago.

Euractiv: Washington rejects Putin’s call to make Turkey Europe’s gas hub 
The US has reacted negatively to a proposal made by Russian President Vladimir Putin to turn Turkey into a gas hub for the EU. 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently backed the Kremlin’s idea of creating an international gas hub in Turkey and urged his government on 14 October to quickly present implementation plans. 
“We have continued to urge our allies to take steps to diversify their energy sources, to reduce energy reliance on Russia. And in the case of Turkey, we are working with them closely to assist in their own efforts to enhance energy security in the long term,” US State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Wednesday.

Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Russia announced the evacuation of civilians from a key southern Ukrainian city Tuesday as it acknowledged the situation for its troops on the ground in Ukraine was "tense" in the face of a counter-offensive.
Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, scrambled to rebuild damaged energy facilities across the country following a series of deadly Russian strikes and President Volodymyr Zelensky charged that Moscow's purported use of Iranian-made drones in the attacks highlighted its "military and political bankruptcy".

The warning from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy is the first official signal that Kyiv could be facing a tougher fight for funding as it fends off Russia's invasion, with bipartisan support beginning to wane in the United States.
"I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won't do it," McCarthy told online politics outlet Punchbowl News.

Tuesday's strikes appeared to be aimed at Ukrainian power stations that Russian-guided suicide drones had failed to reach the previous day.
But the body of Tetyana's 44-year-old son Oleksiy had been missing since his capture in Russia's aborted assault on Kyiv in the first weeks of the war in March.
Tetyana never saw her son's corpse after its discovery in a random field last month.
Her granddaughter decided it would be too much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James Bond actor Daniel Craig on Tuesday received the same honor held by his fictional character, as he is set to retire from the role.
The 54-year-old British actor who played Bond for the fifth and final time in 2021 film "No Time To Die", was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, a rare honor that author Ian Fleming bestowed on his fictional agent.
Craig bowed his head and smirked as Princess Anne, wearing naval uniform, put the order on its ribbon around his neck during an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.
The actor received the honor for his outstanding contribution to film and theatre.
Craig was in the British capital for the European premiere of whodunnit drama "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery", which closed the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday.
"We've been expecting you", the royal family's official Twitter account captioned its photograph, quoting a line famously used by a Bond villain.
James Bond was said to have received the honor in his obituary in "You Only Live Twice," Ian Fleming Publications tweeted.
It was not the first time Craig reprised his Bond role with the royal family in on the joke.
He donned a tuxedo to film a spoof clip with Queen Elizabeth II and her corgis for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Games Olympics hosted by London. .

In "Bibi: My Story", the 72-year-old politician said he will be "forever grateful" for the time in opposition that allowed him to complete his memoir, since a motley coalition of parties ousted him but failed to last its term.

Between the two presidential rounds, Bolsonaro is blowing hot and cold on the issue – making threats to galvanize his base, then backing down to reassure undecided voters. If re-elected, however, the far-right president could well find the numbers to make changes to the court.
The outcome of the bitter contest between Bolsonaro and social democratic ex-president Lula Inacio de Silva is hard to predict, ahead of the second round of Brazil’s presidential election on October 30.

The 24-year-old has been charged with the rape and murder of a minor aged under 15 along with torture and abuse, the source said.
A judge ordered that she be held in provisional custody.
Prosecutors said in a press release Monday that under questioning, the woman made "varying statements, switching between admitting and denying the facts of the case."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Russia's Duma has indefinitely stopped broadcasting live plenary sessions to protect information from "our enemy", a leading lawmaker said on Tuesday as parliament's lower house debated topics related to the war in Ukraine.
"Those questions that require sensitive discussion in a narrow professional circle should not be the property of our enemy," Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the dominant United Russia faction, told the military news channel Zvezda TV.
Russia uses the term "special military operation" to describe what Ukraine and its Western allies say is a war of imperial conquest. Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.
The move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday's session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.
They were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.
Another deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the "special military operation". He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.
"Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies," Svintsov said.

Schönbohm, who leads the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), has been under fire for his links to the Cyber Security Council Germany, which itself has been criticized for being too close to Russian intelligence circles.
Schönbohm helped set up the Cyber Security Council Germany 10 years ago.
The reported accusations against Schönbohm had "permanently damaged the necessary trust of the public in the neutrality and impartiality of the leadership of the president of the most important German cybersecurity authority," the Interior Ministry said.]]></summary>

PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unions began a nationwide strike on Tuesday, asking for higher salaries amid decades-high inflation and posing President Emmanuel Macron one of his stiffest challenges since his reelection in May.
The strike, which will primarily affect public sectors such as schools and transportation, is an extension of the weeks-long industrial action that has disrupted France's major refineries and put petrol stations' supply in disarray.
Trade union leaders are hoping workers will be energized by the government's decision to force some of them to go back to work at petrol depots to try and get the fuel flowing again, a move some say put in jeopardy the right to strike.
French government spokesperson Olivier Veran said more requisitions of staff could…]]></summary>

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Russian missile struck an apartment building in the Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv early on Tuesday, a Reuters witness said, the latest strike on a city hours after the United States warned that it would hold Russia accountable for war crimes.
The missile, which caused one of three explosions heard in the southern city in the early hours of Tuesday, completely destroyed one wing of the building in the downtown area, leaving a massive crater.
A fire crew pulled the dead body of a man from the rubble, the witness said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 2016 election season, Russian hackers went after the national Republican and Democratic Party servers. Now according to the FBI, China is setting its sights on state parties, which likely have lower resources available for tech security. 
The Washington Post revealed that government hackers are scanning domains looking for possible vulnerabilities. Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. 
“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”
The official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”
The FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. 
"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”
“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States said Monday that it had confidence in Pakistan's ability to control its nuclear arsenal after President Joe Biden expressed alarm, leading Islamabad to summon the US ambassador.
"The United States is confident of Pakistan's commitment and its ability to secure its nuclear assets," State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
"The US has always viewed a secure and prosperous Pakistan as critical to US interests and, more broadly, the US values our long-standing cooperation with Pakistan," he said.
Biden made the off-the-cuff remarks on Pakistan's nuclear program Thursday while at a private Democratic Party fundraiser in California where he began to discuss challenges facing President Xi Jinping of China, a close ally of Pakistan.
"And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion," Biden said, according to a White House transcript.
Pakistan -- proud to be the only declared nuclear power in the Islamic world -- summoned US Ambassador Donald Blome to lodge a protest.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that Pakistan was a "responsible nuclear state" and that it takes safety measures "with the utmost seriousness."
US officials have long privately voiced alarm about nuclear safety if the political situation changes in Pakistan, whose military and intelligence apparatus has assisted Afghanistan's Taliban.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Biden's remarks should not hurt relations, noting that the president was not speaking at an official function.
But Bhutto Zardari, who recently visited Washington, called for more interaction, with Biden showing little interest in personally engaging his Pakistani counterparts.
Patel noted, however, that USAID chief Samantha Power and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet have both visited since devastating floods hit Pakistan.
"This is a relationship we view as important and it's something that we're going to continue to remain deeply engaged in," he said.]]></summary>

At least two people had been killed in the incident, news agencies reported citing emergency services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix on Monday defended its latest series of "The Crown" after former British prime minister John Major lashed out at a story line showing King Charles plotting to oust the late queen.
Major's tenure as prime minister from 1990-1997 covered a turbulent period for the royals that included the divorce of Charles and his wife Princess Diana.
But reported scenes in the fifth series -- defended by streaming giant Netflix as a "fictionalized dramatization" -- have incensed the former premier.
In one scene, heir to the throne Charles attempts to draw Major into a conspiracy to force the abdication of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.
A statement issued by Major's office castigated Netflix for the scenes describing them as "damaging and malicious fiction".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser who also served as a key witness against him during his first impeachment trial, says she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been using Tesla CEO Elon Musk to exert diplomatic pressure on Ukraine.
In an interview with Politico, Hill said that Musk -- who floated a widely panned "peace plan" between Russia and Ukraine and who also recently demanded that the American government start footing the bill for Ukraine's continued access to the Starlink satellite network -- is essentially being used as a conduit for Putin as he tries to end the conflict in Ukraine favorably on Russian terms.
"This is a classic Putin play," she said of Musk's recent attempts to interject himself as a "peacemaker" between Russia and Ukraine. "Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin."
Hill also outlined the ways that Putin often uses Russian-friendly businesspeople to act as his intermediaries as a way to get around traditional communications channels.

"He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process," she explained. "He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia."

The main suspect has been identified as a 24-year-old woman suffering from psychiatric disorders.
She was arrested on Saturday in Bois-Colombes in Paris' northwestern suburbs, after being spotted on CCTV images from the block of flats home to the young victim, identified only by her first name, Lola.

Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv shortly before the first explosion at around 6:35 am (0335), followed by sirens across most of the country.
"The capital was attacked by kamikaze drones," the president's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on social media.
"The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation," he added.
"We need more air defense systems and as soon as possible. More weapons to defend the sky and destroy the enemy."
The attacks come exactly a week after Russia unleashed a massive wave of missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital and cities across the coun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Liz Truss was running to lead Britain this summer, an ally predicted her first weeks in office would be turbulent.
But few were prepared for the scale of the sound and fury – least of all Truss herself.
In just six weeks, the prime minister’s libertarian economic policies have triggered a financial crisis, emergency central bank intervention, multiple U-turns and the firing of her Treasury chief.
Now Truss faces a mutiny inside the governing Conservative Party that leaves her leadership hanging by a thread.
Conservative lawmaker Robert Halfon fumed on Sunday that the last few weeks had brought “one horror story after another.”
“The government has looked like libertarian jihadists and treated the whole country as kind of laboratory mice on which to carry out ultra, ultra free-market ex…]]></summary>

"We are astonished by the accusations that the kingdom is standing with Russia in its war with Ukraine," the Saudi defense minister, Prince Khaled bin Salman, tweeted late Sunday.
The Saudi-led OPEC+ cartel -- which includes Russia -- has angered Washington by deciding to cut production by two million barrels per day from November, adding further pressure on soaring crude prices.
"It is telling that these false accusations did not come from the Ukrainian government," Prince Khaled wrote. "Although the OPEC+ decision, which was taken unanimously, was due to purely economic reasons, some accused the k…]]></summary>

EU border agency Frontex confirmed to AFP the arrival of the group in circumstances which the Greek ministry for civil protection said sent out an "inhuman image."
"The Frontex officers reported that the migrants were found almost naked and some of them with visible injuries," said Paulina Bakula, spokeswoman for the organization.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a tweet that it was "deeply distressed by the shocking reports and images of 92 people, who were reported to have been found at the Greek-Turkish land border, stripped of their clothes".

Stormy US-Saudi relations have seen new strain over Riyadh's recent support for oil production cuts, with Biden warning of unspecified "consequences."
The move last week by OPEC+ -- composed of the Riyadh-led OPEC cartel and an additional group of 10 exporters headed by Russia -- would reduce global output by up to two million barrels per day from November.
It could send energy prices soaring amid an energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, and as inflation-weary American voters prepare to cast ballots in midterm elections.
The move was widely seen as a diplomatic slap in the face, since Biden traveled …]]></summary>

Lula attacked Bolsonaro as the "king of fake news," drawing accusations of lying, corruption and a "disgraceful" record in return, as the rivals sparred in the first debate for their polarizing second-round showdown on October 30.
Lula, the charismatic but tarnished ex-president (2003-2010) who is seeking a comeback at 76, was particularly fiery criticizing Bolsonaro over his handling of Covid-19, which has killed 687,000 people in Brazil, second only to the United States.

Near the southern border with Equatorial Guinea, eight villages have registered complaints with the Campo Ma'an national park, a vast area of virgin forest from where the animals emerge.
An estimated 500 gorillas and more than 200 elephants -- both endangered species -- roam the reserve's 264,000 hectares (652,000 acres).
A week after elephants flattened his banana plantation close by the park, Simplice Yomen, 47, is struggling to cope.
"We are at the end of our tether," he sighs.
The elephants eat the new growth inside the banana tree trunks after splitting them open.
