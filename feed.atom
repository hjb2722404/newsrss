        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden is clearly trying to “send a message” to the National Bureau of Economic Research that he doesn’t want a recession declared, says Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood. 

Mr Biden said there will be “a lot of chatter” on Wall Street about whether the US is in recession but reassured people there are signs of “economic progression”. 

“Really the expectation of the US economy is not for strong growth, not for a strong rebound,” Mr Greenwood said. 

“Really what you’re getting is very subdued growth in the United States.”]]></summary>

PKSOI: Semi Annual Lesson Reports: Defense Support to Stabilization (DSS)
The US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI) has released a two-volume collection on lessons learned for Defense Support to Stabilization or activities related to logistical support, supplies, and servicfes for federal agencies involved in stabilization activities. The Global Fragility Act of 2019 outlined a US strategy to prevent conflict and promote stability in countries identified by the Department of State in partnership with other federal agencies. Among those agencies is the Department of Defense (DOD) with its relatively new interagency support authority, the Defense Support to Stabilization, or DSS. This new authority allows DOD to provide logistical support, supplies and services to other federal agencies so that critical civilian expertise can be in place quickly and efficiently for a unity of effort that the interagency may have lacked in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We were briefed that over 75,000 Russians have either been killed or wounded, which is huge. You've got incredible amounts of investment in their land forces, over 80% of their land forces are bogged down, and they're tired,” @RepSlotkin told CNN. (h/t @MZanona @NatashaBertrand)
— Marshall Cohen (@MarshallCohen) July 28, 2022
   Business Insider: More than 75,000 Russian troops in Ukraine have been killed or injured, US says — one of the highest estimates so far 
* US officials think more than 75,000 Russians were killed or injured in Ukraine, reports said. 
* Estimates for Russian troop losses have varied, but this is one of the highest given so far. 
* Russia has not released its troop loss figures in months, and is accused of covering up its dead. 
US officials said that more than 75,000 Russians have been killed or injured as part of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to multiple reports. 
The figure would represent around half the total number of troops Russia sent to Ukraine at the start of its invasion. It is significantly higher than estimates US officials have given in public. 
CNN reporter Michael Cohen tweeted on Wednesday that Rep. Elissa Slotkin told CNN she and other House lawmakers had been given the 75,000 figure that day by US officials.

    Radio Free Asia: China holds new naval drills as US carrier transits South China Sea  
China often holds military exercises at short notice in response to U.S. naval activities in disputed seas. 
China has staged another military exercise off the back of a five-day large-scale drill near the Paracel islands–just as the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan docked in Singapore after spending over a week in the South China Sea. 
The U.S. carrier and its strike group were slated to visit Vietnam this month but the visit has been called off, said two Vietnamese sources with knowledge of the matter who wish to stay anonymous because they’re not authorised to speak to the media.

Update #2: China and US deploy naval strike groups as Taiwan holds massive military drills amid war fears over Pelosi visit (The SUN)   
WNU Editor: Now is not the time to send a US carrier group to Taiwan. Tensions are already incredibly high, and from the Chinese perspective they feel they have no choice but to respond. I can only hope that the Chinese response will not be a reckless one that can quickly escalate into a disaster.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[of ether (ETH) The 53% rally from July 13-18 gave the bulls an edge on July’s $1.26 billion monthly options expiration.  The move came as Ethereum developers set a tentative date for the “merger,” a transition out of the tedious proof-of-work (PoW) mining mechanism.

According to some analysts, by removing the additional issuance of ETH used to finance the energy cost required on traditional mining consensus, Ether could finally achieve “ultra-sound currency” status.

On Beacon Chain, the issuance will be around 1,600 ETH per day, which will significantly reduce inflation by 13,000 ETH per day on PoW. 
The merger sets the effects on the monetary policies of Ethereum to become ultrasonic money.

When Glenn Greenwald announced that he would host the premiere of a documentary on Alex Jones — and interviewing the infamous conspiracy theorist — many who once respected the famed investigative journalist lamented this new low in his career.
Greenwald retaliated in a series of tweets confusing the ‘damn stupid’ notion that journalists should refrain from interviewing bad people, pointing out that mainstream media journalists have no qualms about interviewing George W. Bush and his ilk.
Fair point.

The United States reported 4,639 known cases of monkeypox on Wednesday, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data – surpass The 3,738 Spanish cases for the highest tally in the world.  Globally, more than 20,600 cases have been confirmed in 77 countries.  Of that, more than 20,300 have been confirmed in countries that have never reported monkeypox infections.

In response to the increase in numbers, our government has issued a familiar appeal to the public.

And then I laughed, tickled by how easily Semans and his star, the charismatic Rebecca Hall, had persuaded me to invest in their crazy shenanigans.
But then Hall – as evidenced last year’s creepout, “The Night House” – has a knack for pumping gravity into somewhat bonkers narratives.  Here, she embodies Margaret, an executive in a sort of pharmaceutical outfit, and from the outset there is an intensity that borders on obsession.  Whether at work or as a protective single mother to her teenage daughter, Abbie (Grace Kaufman), Margaret is a calculated model of control.  Even her sex life is tig…]]></summary>

A war between Haitian gangs which has left hundreds dead since it flared up three weeks ago has spread to the centre of the capital, Port-au-Prince. 
Gang members engaged in a fierce gun battle with each other and with police on Wednesday. 
The city's temporary cathedral caught fire amid the fighting. 
It is not yet known how many people were killed in this latest battle but UN figures suggest more than 200 died between 8 and 17 July. 
Previously, the focal points of the battle between the G9 criminal alliance and a rival alliance calling itself G-Pèp had centred around the impoverished neighbourhood of Cité Soleil. But on Wednesday, video showed police confronting gang members not far from the presidential palace.

The dollar, which has been on a steep upward climb for about a year now, equaled the value of the euro this month for the first time in two decades. The Japanese yen has also fallen sharply against the dollar. 
A strong dollar can make products imported into America cheaper and make trips abroad less expensive for American travelers. B…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph shows the change in date from 1971 to 2022 of Earth Overshoot Day which designates the date when humanity has consumed all natural resources that the Earth can renew in a year   
Daily Mail: We've already 'busted the planet's budget': Earth Overshoot Day is earlier than EVER before due to an overwhelming demand for food, land, timber and new infrastructure in 2022 
* Earth Overshoot Day comes when demand exceeds the planet's yearly resources 
* Humans 'busted Earth's budget' as of Thursday (July 28), earlier than ever before 
* For the rest of the year forests are depleted and CO2 builds up in the atmosphere 
As of today, humans have already used a year's worth of natural resources in 2022 – a calendar event known as Earth Overshoot Day. 
The annual date marks the point at which humanity has used all the biological resources that the Earth can regenerate during that year. 
But in 2022 it's earlier than ever before, largely due to a demand for food, land, timber and new urban infrastructure to cater to a growing population. 
Demand for these resources outstrips the Earth's biocapacity – its ability to renew those resources – meaning we now effectively have gone into overdraft.

China and the US should collaborate on global infrastructure, not compete.
 China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013, is the centerpiece of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ambitious effort to expand his country’s diplomatic and economic footprint. A massive infrastructure and development investment strategy, the BRI has funded bridges, ports, power plants, railways, tunnels, and 5G networks in the Global South, to the tune of $50 billion to $100 billion per year, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. 
The BRI now covers over 139 countries, which together make up 63…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s no surprise that “Rhythm Is Life,” the show Dormeshia Tap Collective is performing at the Joyce Theater this week, is a classy affair.  The Dormeshia tap dancer is the epitome of elegance, and has been since she was a child.  But she’s not just classy;  she is classic: so deeply versed in the tradition and technique of tap dancing that she has everything under her command and never has to worry.
“Rhythm Is Life” is a classical style tap dance concert.  Dormeshia is joined by a jazz trio and three other clogs in a format that alternates between solos and group numbers, with group numbers switching between unison sections and serial spots for solo improvisation.  Dormeshia’s choreography is very much like his improvisations: perfectly measured and modulated, complex without clutter, alw…]]></summary>

 Reuters: Far from Ukraine, Russia plans big eastern war games next month 
LONDON (Reuters) -Russia plans to hold strategic military exercises in the east of the country starting next month, the defence ministry said on Tuesday, thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine. 
The "Vostok" (East) exercises will take place from Aug. 30 to Sept. 5. 
They appear intended to send a message that Russia, despite the costly five-month war in Ukraine, remains focused on the defence of its entire territory and capable in military terms of sustaining "business as usual". 
But that may be a challenge given Moscow's heavy losses in men and equipment in Ukraine - including troops and hardware sent there from the eastern military district where the war games will take place.

Military.com: Ukraine Official Says Country Doesn't Want Old American A-10s

But in a message to Military.com on Tuesday, Yuriy Sak -- an adviser to Ukraine's minister of defense -- made it clear: The country doesn't need A-10s, it needs the more modern F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet. 
The A-10s "will not close our sky, they will not stop bombers and missiles," Sak said in a message. "They will be a target for Russian jet fighters and anti-aircraft defense, because we don't have the means neither to effectively cover them, nor to break through the enemy anti-aircraft defence."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg: Biden Will Speak With Xi on Thursday as US-China Ties Worsen 
(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday amid fresh tensions over Taiwan, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The first conversation between the two presidents since March will take place at a particularly difficult juncture for US-China ties: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s staff and security officials aren’t ruling out plans for her to visit Taiwan in early August. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday that Beijing was getting “seriously prepared” for the possibility that Pelosi could visit the self-governing island, which China considers part of its territory.

WNU Editor: What caught my attention about this report is that it is the first time in four months that both leaders will be talking to each other.   I am old enough to remember when Presidents Obama and Trump talked with the Chinese leader on a regular basis. One or two times a month. 
No more now under President Biden. 

As for this call tomorrow. I have zero expectations that anything significant will be decided upon. This is a call that is being initiated by the White House to discuss trade and tariffs. 
The problem is that President Xi has already made it known publicly that he does not trust President Biden. His beef is that President Biden says he will do one thing, but the opposite happens from the White House a few days or weeks later.

Euractiv/Reuters: Ukraine's Naftogaz stumbles into default amid new debt overhaul push 
Ukraine’s Naftogaz has become the first Ukrainian government entity to default since the start of the Russian invasion, after the state energy firm said it would not make payments on international bonds before the Tuesday (26 July) expiry of a grace period. 
The default may accelerate repayments on the two other Naftogaz bonds, but does not trigger a sovereign cross-default. 
The energy company said in a statement that it had failed to get creditors’ support on a proposal to freeze payments on some of its bonds for two years, which it launched on 12 July saying Russia’s invasion meant many of its customers were now unable to pay their bills.

Daily Beast: Secret Briefing Zeroes in on Suspected Russian Spy Station in New York 
The State Department is so worried that a Russian diplomatic compound in the Bronx is serving as a Russian spy hub that it held a classified briefing about the compound on Friday. 
The previously unreported briefing touched on concerns about the compound and its potential ties to Russian espionage operations—concerns which Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) raised in March of this year when he sent a letter to the Directors of the FBI, CIA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. 
Torres, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, requested that the Biden Administration consider opening an investigation into the compound in order to protect the country against Russian espionage. 
It’s not clear what the outcome of the meeting was. Torres declined to comment on what was discussed in the meeting, citing the classified nature of the gathering. Due to security reasons, the State Department also declined to share details about the meeting.

Many settlements close to the front lines in Donetsk have come under fire in the past 24 hours as Russian forces try to break down Ukrainian defenses, according to the head of the region’s military administration. 
He added that “the front is approaching the city of Bakhmut, where there were systematic artillery fire and air strikes” on Monday. 
Bakhmut is a key objective of Russian forces as a gateway to the remainder of the region still in Ukrainian hands. 
Russian forces are estimated to be about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) southeast of the town.

Update: Enemy Preparing For Offensive On Siversk And Soledar In Donetsk Region - General Staff (Ukrainian News).   
WNU Editor: Reports from both Russia and Ukraine are saying that Russian forces are making significant advances along the Donbas front in the past 24 hours.
I do not know if these reports are true, but I do know that the Ukraine army must hold the Bakhmut to Siversk defensive line (see above map). Should this defense line fail, Russian and DPR forces will then be free to rush to Kramatorsk and Slovyansk (the last two major cities held by the Ukrainian army in Donetsk), and from there be able to capture the rest of Donetsk province in a very short period of time. 
A social media post today from a senior separatist Donetsk official gave a timeline on how long he thinks it will take before the entire region of the Donbas has been cleared of Ukrainian forces. He gives it to the end of August.]]></summary>

   Newsweek: ‘Thermite Munitions’ Rain from Sky on Ukraine’s Donetsk in Striking Videos 
Videos circulating on social media purport to show thermite munitions raining down from the sky in Donetsk, a city in eastern Ukraine. 
Since April, Russia has concentrated on capturing the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces that make up the Donbas region, where pro-Moscow separatists have proclaimed independence. 
White streaks were seen lighting up the night sky as they fell in Donetsk, which is under the control of Russian-backed separatists, in numerous videos shared on Twitter and Telegram. 
“There are a number of videos showing what looks like incendiary munitions used on Donetsk tonight,” Rob Lee, a Russian defense policy specialist at King’s College London’s Department of War Studies, tweeted alongside a video.

Last week, Canadian news reports told of farm-related protests erupting across the country — including one that saw a slow roll convoy head through downtown Ottawa. 
These reports described this activism as a show of support for Dutch farmers.

They say the regulations will force the closure of farms across the country and send food prices soaring.

* Republicans have thrown their support behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reported upcoming trip to Taiwan 
* Newt Gingrich said Pelosi should go and she 'sought to tell the Pentagon and the State Department to shut up' about it 
* Gingrich was last speaker to visit Taiwan 
* Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also encouraged Pelosi to go 
* Pelosi has not publicly confirmed the trip 
* China has made it clear they do not want her to go 
* U.S. officials worried China could take action against island nation soon 
Republicans have thrown their support behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reported upcoming trip to Taiwan despite China warning of consequences if she visits. 
Newt Gingrich, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska are among those encouraging Pelosi to visit the island - a proposed trip that is causing a rift between the speaker and President Joe Biden's administration. 
It's unusual show of support from Republicans for the Democratic speaker and comes as amid concern China could move against the island nation soon.

Daily Mail: Germany on the brink: EU's economic powerhouse is heading for recession and energy rationing – with bills tripling – after Merkel ignored warnings Putin could cripple Europe by choking gas supplies 
* Russia is slowly choking off gas supplies to Germany, which are now down to just 20 per cent of normal level 
* Country is now facing an acute shortage over winter, amid warnings whole industries may have to shut down 
* £240billion could be wiped off the economy, experts warn, which could plunge into a recession until 2024 
* Household bills could triple, with street lights dimmed and swimming pools already shut to make savings 
* Pain is a legacy of Angela Merkel, who ignored 15 years of warnings about over-reliance on Russian energy 
Europe's summer heatwave has only just finished, but already panic is growing in Germany over what horrors may lay in store for its citizens this winter. 
Vladimir Putin is choking the country's gas supplies - officially because of 'essential repair work' to pipelines, though few doubt he is exacting revenge for Berlin's defiance over Ukraine. Flows through Nord Stream 1, Germany's main gas pipe, are now at 20 per cent of normal levels. There are fears it could soon close for good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: EU split over standing up to Putin: Bloc agrees 'voluntary' 15% cut in fuel use to tackle Russian gas squeeze… but with loopholes for most countries, including GERMANY 
* EU agrees 15% 'voluntary' gas use reduction as Putin squeezes Europe's supply 
* However some countries opposed the move as an unfair burden on them 
* Russia recently reduced gas supply through Nord Stream 1 pipe to just 20% 
European Union countries have come together to agree a controversial 'voluntary' cut to its overall gas consumption by 15 per cent in the face of a Russian supply squeeze. 
But loopholes in the agreement will ease the pain for many countries and industries, including Germany, after some EU governments resisted the original proposal to impose binding cuts on every country. 
Europe faces an increased gas squeeze from Wednesday, when Russia's Gazprom has said it would cut flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany from 40 per cent to just a fifth of capacity.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its global growth forecast to 3.2% amid high inflation and the war in Ukraine, and warned the world could be "teetering on the edge of global recession." 
In an update to its global growth forecast Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of risks to the global economy, which if left unchecked, could push the world into a recession. 
High inflation and the risks posed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine are responsible for placing the global economy in peril, the IMF said, adding that "worst case" scenarios are possible. 
In a statement, IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said, "the world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one." 
Gourinchas added that the the current environment suggests that the "likelihood that the US economy can avoid a recession" is "quite narrow."

Russian-Israeli diamond oligarch Lev Leviev and Russian property developer God Nisanov are the latest high-profile Russians known to have applied for citizenship under the legislation.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that Nisanov, who was hit by sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, was "one of the richest men in Europe and a close associate of several Russian officials".

KYIV (Reuters) - The United States promised more military support for Ukraine, including drones, and is doing preliminary work on whether to send fighter aircraft, as fighting raged on in the east of the country five months into Russia's invasion.
Moscow and Kyiv signed a landmark deal on Friday to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports. However, representatives declined to sit at the same table and avoided shaking hands at the agreement ceremony in Istanbul, reflecting wider enmity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Friday's agreement as unlocking around $10 billion worth of grain exports, needed to ease a food crisis.
But on the war, he said there could be no ceasefire unless lost territory was retaken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The murders in June of British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon were likely sparked when they sought to photograph a boat belonging to their killers, the Attorney General's office said Friday.
Pereira had asked Phillips to photograph the boat, according to a statement from the office that said this detail may count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
The details were revealed after the filing Thursday of charges against the three men suspected of committing the double murder.
Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima have both confessed to the crime, according to officials, while Oseney da Costa de Oliveira -- brother of Amarildo -- has not.
The trio stands accused of murder in the first degree and of hiding the bodies.
"Bruno was killed by three bullets, one in the back without any possibility of defense," said the statement.
"Dom was killed simply because he was with Bruno, in order to ensure impunity for the previous crime."
Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were shot dead while returning from an expedition in a remote region of the rainforest that is plagued by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and fishing.
Phillips, the author of dozens of articles on the Amazon and a long-time contributor to The Guardian newspaper and other major news organizations, was traveling to the Javari Valley as part of research for a book.
Pereira was serving as his guide, and had previously traveled with him to the area.
An outspoken defender of Indigenous rights, Pereira had received multiple death threats prior to his murder.
Police are investigating a possible link to illegal fishing on protected Indigenous lands -- an issue close to Pereira's heart -- as a motive for the killing.

When the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, won a landslide victory in May, 2022, he went to visit the home of his mother Imelda, former first lady and wife of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. 
In a video showing mother congratulating son, one detail in Imelda’s opulent home stood out. On the wall, was a distinctive painting of an abstract nude rendered in blues and greens, on a red and orange bed. It was unmistakably Pablo Picasso’s “Femme Couchée VI”.

Lustosa wears no specialized suit or gloves, however, just a light net to cover his face. These bees are stingless.
"What a wonder!" Lustosa marvels at the honey-filled wax craters in the hive as the bees attack him furiously, but impotently -- his childlike amazement not diminished by six years working with the insects.
Long overlooked, Brazil's native bees are making a comeback, with people such as Lustosa, a 66-year-old public servant, getting in on the movement to boost their profile.
Of 550 stingless bee species known to exist in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world, some 250 are found in Brazil, according to Cristi…]]></summary>

One license authorizes transactions related to the settlement of credit derivative transactions that reference Russia, according to a notice posted on Treasury's website.
The license authorizes financial institutions to facilitate and clear such transactions, examples of which include the delivery of debt obligations of Russia, the notice said.
A separate license authorizes, through October 19, wind-down transactions involving securities issued by Russia-based entities under agreements that were entered into before June 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan's nuclear regulator on Friday formally approved a plan to release more than a million tonnes of treated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean.
The plan has already been adopted by the government and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but plant operator TEPCO must still win over local communities before going ahead.
The country's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved TEPCO's plan, according to a foreign ministry statement, which said the government would ensure the safety of the treated water as well as the "reliability and transparency of its handling".
Cooling systems at the plant were overwhelmed by a tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake on March 11, 2011, causing the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At a sprawling landfill near Madrid, hundreds of white storks dodge garbage trucks as they look for scraps of food among the mountains of multicoloured garbage bags.
The long-legged birds have traditionally flown from across Europe to African pastures for the winter and returned in the spring.
But the abundant food found in landfills combined with warmer weather are making growing numbers of storks skip this arduous journey and stay in Spain for the winter.
"For us they are part of the landscape," said Carlos Pinto, a sanitation worker at a landfill in Pinto some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Madrid.
The landfill receives between 200 tonnes and 300 tonnes of food waste per day and the storks head immediately to the zones "where there is fresh garbage," he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thousands participated this week in a lavish ceremony in the Marshall Islands marking the first formal coronation of a paramount chief in around 50 years.
The colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned "Iroojlaplap", or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.
The coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a "Kailoojoj" in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.
It was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.
The blowing of a conch shell heralded each stage of the elaborate ceremony, whic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.
Biden on Thursday insisted he was "doing great", and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.
"I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery," Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.
It is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.
The pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
The leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.
Earlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the "next ten days", weeks after both countries' top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.
Beijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.
Pelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: "Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese."]]></summary>

Here is what we know about the deal:
Joint command and control
A joint command and control centre will be set up in Istanbul to oversee smooth operations and resolve disputes.
Its participants will include the two warring sides and officials from Turkey and the United Nations.
UN officials believe that the centre will take three to four weeks to be set up. This means that grain might not start flowing at full speed again until the second half of August.
Its location in Istanbul is both a nod to Turkey's central location and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's key role in resolving a dispute which has often seemed to…]]></summary>

Authorities say police are investigating the killings, the worst of a series of brutal cases of cruelty to dogs.
But they face criticism from animal welfare activists who say laws defending domestic animals like dogs are not being enforced.
The latest killings took place at an industrial compound near the capital Doha on July 10, but the slaughter was only reported days later, activists told AFP.
Four men, two armed with hunting rifles, threatened guards at the factory and then killed 29 dogs and puppies, activists said. At least three others were wounded, including two in the late stages of pregnancy.
When the men showed up the dogs started…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Mexican disability rights activist has died after she was attacked and set on fire in the state of Jalisco, the local prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The mother of an autistic child, Luz Raquel Padilla was part of "I take care of Mexico," an organization of families with experience in caring for people with disabilities.
Three men and a woman doused the 35-year-old in alcohol and set her alight in a park in the town of Zapopan, prosecutor Luis Joaquin Mendez told a press conference, citing witnesses.
Padilla died Tuesday from the "seriousness of the injuries" in a hospital in nearby Guadalajara, he said.
She had burns on 90 percent of her body.
In Mexico, an average of 10 women are murdered daily, according to official figures. Many of these cases bear the hallmarks of gender-based violence.
"We condemn the murder of #care activist Luz Raquel Padilla in #Jalisco, as well as any form of violence against people who defend women's human rights and fight against gender-based violence," UN Women Mexico wrote on Twitter.
Padilla was living under protection measures after threats from a neighbor.
She had posted on social media denunciations of some of her neighbor's behavior, such as listening to loud music, which affected her son's health.
On May 17, she posted photographs on Twitter of threatening graffiti outside her home.
"You're going to die," and "I'm going to burn you alive," the messages read.
"How long am I going to have to live in fear that something could happen to me and my family," she wrote next to the images.
The case is being investigated as a possible femicide, said prosecutors, indicating that the neighbor had been called to testify.
Her son had been left in the custody of his grandmother, whom the Jalisco government would support, the office said.
This year at least 43 people have been lynched and 173 injured in mob attacks in Mexico, according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The International Union for Conservation of Nature on Thursday formally listed the beloved migratory monarch butterfly as endangered, citing dire threats to the subspecies posed by the climate crisis, deforestation, pesticide use, and logging.
Dr. Bruno Oberle, the director-general of IUCN—the world's leading scientific authority on species conservation—said the new listing "highlights the fragility of nature's wonders, such as the unique spectacle of monarch butterflies migrating across thousands of kilometers," a reference to the insects' remarkable biannual journey across North America.
"To preserve the rich diversity of nature, we need effective, fairly governed protected and conserved areas, alongside decisive action to tackle climate change and restore ecosystems," Oberle added. "In …]]></summary>
