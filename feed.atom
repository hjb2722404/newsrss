Ukraine acknowledged Friday its troops were not making speedy headway in their counteroffensive to recapture territory in the east and south of the country from Russian forces. 
"Today it's advancing not so quickly," the head of the presidency Andriy Yermak told reporters, conceding that battles were difficult. 
"If we are going to see that something is going wrong, we'll say so. No one is going to embellish," he said. 
Western allies were not however putting pressure on Kyiv to advance faster, said Yermak, who is seen as President Volodymyr Zelensky's right-hand man. 
"There is no pressure, just a question: how can we help you further?" he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cohen, who has previously said that former president Donald Trump's disrespect for the security of classified information really amounts to a disrespect for the men and women behind that classified information who put their lives on the line for the country, was asked on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta about the "far-right Republicans" who argue that culture war add-ons recently passed in the House as part of a military budget "will help rid the military to what they describe as wokeness."
Cohen said he expects that the Senate will either reject the amendments, or water them down enough to get the support needed to pass.
"We are, after all, trying to make sure that we fund our military, so it is dragging the military through the cultural wars," he said.
When asked what he says to the far-right Republicans who says the military has a "wokeness problem," Cohen suggested he would ask for a definition.
"What is wokeness? What does it mean? I said earlier today that it was Harry Truman, was he woke when he said we can no longer tolerate and accept the segregation of our military? That black men and women have an absolute equal right to serve in our military and serve together and not segregated?"

It has been a very hectic few weeks .... correction .... it has been hectic since the start of the war, and in a certain way it comes to an end for me in a few hours.

Needless to say. Today is a very busy day for me.
Blogging will return this evening. Or I will just go to Old Montreal and enjoy a good meal reflecting on the past 18 months.
One more note, A heads up on where the Ukraine war is going. I have been told by a few sources that I trust in Ukraine that President Zelensky was told by NATO leaders in Vilnius this past week that he has until November to show major results on the battle field. If not, Western support will decease and pressure will be put on him to make a deal with Putin. Some Russian bloggers that I follow have also been reporting the same thing. If true, I expect a major escalation in the conflict in the coming weeks and months. I hate to say this. But we are probably entering a stage where we are going to be witness to the most bloodiest fighting since the start of the war.]]></summary>

CNN: Blinken meets top Chinese diplomat as efforts to ramp down tensions continue 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken “had candid and constructive discussions on a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues” with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on Thursday – the latest in a series of increased high-level interactions between Washington and Beijing. 
Their meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Jakarta comes less than a month after the two met in Beijing for what was also described by the US as “candid and constructive” conversation. 
Wang, who is the top foreign policy chief for the Chinese Communist Party, attended the diplomatic gathering in place of China’s Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, who is unable to attend due to health reasons, Reuters reported, citing a spokesman for his ministry.

(Bloomberg) -- Egypt and Ethiopia agreed to start “urgent” talks about finalizing an agreement relating to filling and operating a Nile dam which officials in Cairo argue will sharply curtail the nation’s access to fresh water. 
Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopian Premier Abiy Ahmed also agreed the nations would work to conclude the agreement within four months, Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency reported Thursday. The agreement would also include Sudan, it said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.
The decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.
It was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of "permanent, irreversible harm" to the area.
The following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.
But the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister's granting of approval.
In a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps' successor Mark Harper said he was "satisfied" that the project's "harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits".
Opponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.
Steve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.
"This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it's not over yet," Gooding said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The European Commission is helping the United Nations and Turkey try to extend a deal allowing the Black Sea export of Ukraine grain and is open to "explore all solutions," a European Union spokesperson said on Thursday, ahead of the deal's possible expiration on Monday. 
 The U.N. and Turkey brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative with Russia and Ukraine in July 2022 to help alleviate a global food crisis worsened by Moscow's invasion and blockade of Ukrainian ports. Ukraine and Russia are among the world's leading grain exporters.

WNU editor: There are reports from Ukraine that Turkish President Erdogan has said the grain deal will be saved .... Putin Agrees to Grain Deal Extension, Says Erdogan (Kyiv Post). I have doubts that the Kremlin will extend this grain deal. There is no benefit to Russia to extend this deal since their grain cannot be shipped out due to sanctions nor be paid for due to sanctions on banking.

London/Berlin CNN  — Germany announced Thursday that it would reduce its dependence on China in “critical sectors” including medicine, lithium batteries used in electric cars and elements essential to chipmaking. 
The government published its first ever “Strategy on China,” a 40-page document that highlights the tightrope Berlin must walk in managing its dependence on the world’s second-largest economy amid growing criticism of Beijing’s human rights record and attitude towards international law. 
China is Germany’s most important trading partner, with imports and exports between the two nations reaching nearly €300 billion ($335 billion) in 2022, according to the government.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey on Friday spent a second day in the witness box at a London court, denying sexual assault charges and claiming the prosecution case against him was weak.
The two-time Oscar winner, 63, is on trial accused of sexually assaulting four men dating back more than 20 years, including when he was artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre.
The prosecution has claimed he was a "sexual bully" who reveled in making others feel uncomfortable, including by aggressively grabbing men's crotches.
Spacey began giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court in south London on Thursday, calling himself a "big flirt" but denying any aggressive behavior.
On Friday, he was questioned about one man who alleged that he drugged him and performed a sex act on him while he was asleep at hi…]]></summary>

The bill, which passed its second reading on Thursday, is part of an ultra-conservative, anti-Western drive that has intensified since the start of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine.
"I feel total despair," said Nikolai -- not his real name -- who spoke on condition that his identity not be revealed.
"If this law enters into force, even hormone therapy will be banned," he said.
The new legislation forbids transition surgery, with the exception of children with congenital defects, and outlaws people changing the registration of their gender in official documents.

Underground fires, which scientists believe started in a mine accident in 1916, create sinkholes that swallow people and homes. Coal pickers and activists report hundreds of people have died over the decades.

The country may be synonymous with the beautiful game, but it banned women from the sport for nearly four decades until 1979.
Ahead of the Women's World Cup starting next week in Australia and New Zealand, where Brazil will be in action, Mendes recalled the lengths she went to in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a soccer player.
As a girl in the 1970s, she gave ice cream to the boys she played with in Camacari in Brazil's impoverished northeast in exchange for an early warning of the arrival of police busting girls flouting the prohibition.
She used to dig a hole next to the pitch to hide in until the enforcers left, then crawled out again to continue kicking the ball aroun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Athens Acropolis, Greece's top tourist attraction, will close during the hottest hours on Friday as the country wilts under a heatwave, the culture minister announced.
Access to the UNESCO-listed archaeological site dating to antiquity will be suspended between midday and 5:00 pm (0900 GMT and 1400 GMT) before reopening "to protect workers and visitors", Lina Mendoni told public broadcaster ERT.
"It's highly likely that we will take the same measure tomorrow (Saturday)," the minister said.
Temperatures are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Athens on Friday and Saturday, but at the summit of the Acropolis human bodies feel much more heat, she added.
Other popular tourist sites surrounding the Sacred Rock on which the Acropolis stands, such as the Ancient Agora, will remain open.
The Acropolis, which has seen a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.
A summer heatwave is hitting several Mediterranean countries, with forecasters predicting the mercury to soar past 40C in northern and western Greece.
The authorities have in recent days taken measures to cope. The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.
Shelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.
The authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.
Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
"Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?" asked Blitzer.
"He needs to lift the holdings," said Austin. "This is a national security issue, a readiness issue."
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin's call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?" asked Blitzer.
"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy," said Austin. "I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them."
"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?" asked Blitzer.
"That's our policy," said Austin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been "eaten alive."
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates "do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door." 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions," she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a "racial justice issue," citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doctors were able to complete a "miracle" surgery where they reattached a boy's head who had suffered an "internal decapitation" as a result of being hit by a car while he was riding his bike, Fox News reported.  
Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was "almost completely detached from the base of his neck." The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use "new plates and fixations in the damaged area." 
"Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room," Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
"The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing," Einav said.]]></summary>

Sources at the BBC claim presenter Victoria Derbyshire was investigating accusations about Edwards’ conduct in the days before The Sun made its claims.

        <link href="https://www.rawstory.com/spacey-denies-aggressive-behavior-in-uk-trial/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-13T14:52:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a "big flirt" but denied any "aggressive" behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to "come off the road".
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said "it didn't happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way".
"It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic," Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a "big flirt".
But the alleged victim "made it clear that he did not want to go any further," the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt "crushed" after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a "stab in the back".
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as "madness".
"I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn't and never have to anyone in my life," Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn't recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", was artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
