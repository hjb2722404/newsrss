        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social media users have reacted online after pro-Palestinian activists took over London's Liverpool Street Station to stage a sit-in protest, calling for an end to Israel's attacks on Gaza.
 
Over 500 pro-Palestinian activists organised a sit-in protest, denouncing the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 
The sit-in, orchestrated by the direct action group Sisters Uncut, featured Palestinian music and chants like "ceasefire now".
 
Various activist groups, including the Palestinian Youth Movement and International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, joined the demonstration.
 
The protest concluded around 7 p.m. and the station continued its operations, a Network Rail spokeswoman confirmed.
 
British Transport Police responded to reports of the protest and reportedly ensured a safe dispersal of the crowd, allowing passengers access to the station.
 
A similar sit-in involving more than 200 people occurred at London Waterloo station on the preceding Saturday.]]></summary>

With just the sun and a solar panel, a theater can be set up in areas where people struggle to access food and water and make a decent living.

Creating resilience is crucial to adapting to climate change and ensuring climate justice. 
 Although women account for more than three-quarters of the agricultural labour force and manage 40 percent of small-scale farms, historically, they neither owned nor controlled the land because land rights were passed down to male relatives. It is a historic gender injustice whereby women could only access land through close male relatives.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/31/35192">Read the full story, “Women Correct Historical Injustices, Build Climate Resilience Through Cash Pooling”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

* Houthi rebels said they fired a series of drones towards Israeli city of Eilat 
* Iran today warned the situation in the Middle East could 'get out of control' 
Iran today boasted its powerful proxies 'won't stay silent' and hinted the fighting between Israel and Hamas could engulf the Middle East after the Tehran-backed Huthi rebels fired drones into the Jewish state from Yemen. 
The Huthis, who seized Yemen's capital Sanaa in 2014 and control large swathes of the country, said they fired a series of drones towards the Red Sea city of Eilat this morning in retaliation to Israel's war against Hamas. 
'These drones belong to the state of Yemen. We are fighting with words and drones,' Abdelaziz bin Habtour, prime minister of the Huthi government, said.

Zero Hedge: Bills On Israel, Ukraine 'Dead On Arrival' In Both House And Senate As Shutdown, Funding Battles Gear Up 
As the nation celebrates Halloween, the House and Senate are engaged in some spooky late-stage Republic chaos over aid to Israel and Ukraine amid a backdrop of yet another government shutdown looming in two weeks. 
* The government will run out of money (again) in roughly two weeks, requiring Congress to act (again). 
* According to Democrats and GOP Neocons such as Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, America needs to send billions of taxpayer funds to both Israel and Ukraine, and won't consider any legislation that doesn't combine the two. 
* House Republicans under newly minted Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), as well as a group of Senate Republicans, want Israel aid separated from Ukraine aid, while the Biden White House wants to jam a $105 billion foreign aid package ($14B to Israel, $60B to Ukraine) through Congress. 
* The House's plan (if they can even pass it) to separate Israel aid from Ukraine aid is DOA in the Senate, while both the Senate's combined package and the Biden admin's package is DOA in the House.

France 24: A record 6.9 million people are internally displaced in DR Congo, says UN 
Escalating violence has pushed the number of people internally displaced within the Democratic Republic of Congo to a record 6.9 million, the United Nations said Monday. 
The conflict between M23 rebels and militias loyal to the DRC's government has intensified in the eastern province of North Kivu since early October, particularly north of the provincial capital Goma. 
The UN's International Organization for Migration said many people who have fled their homes but stayed within the DRC's borders desperately needed help to meet their basic needs.

The advertising campaign exploited the civil rights movements of the 1960s, indicating that those cigarettes were enjoyed by strong, independent, and liberated women.</p><p>A blatant lie – why would “independent” women choose to poison themselves with a commodity which each year causes  more than 480,000 deaths in the US alone – nearly one in five deaths? Another question arising from this deceitful ad is: “How far have women come on their way to independence and liberation?”</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/31/35189">Read the full story, “Women and War”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

 VOA: 24 Attacks Target US Forces in Iraq, Syria 
Pentagon — U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked with drones or rockets at least 24 times in recent days, including at least three attacks on Monday, according to U.S. defense officials. 
At least five of these attacks were launched after U.S. forces struck two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups during the early morning hours of Friday. 
None of the attacks carried out since the U.S. retaliatory strikes on Friday have caused casualties or damage, according to defense officials. 
The latest attack on Monday used multiple rockets to target al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq, a defense official told VOA on condition of anonymity due to security sensitivities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time: ‘Nobody Believes in Our Victory Like I Do.’ Inside Volodymyr Zelensky’s Struggle to Keep Ukraine in the Fight 
Volodymyr Zelensky was running late. 
The invitation to his speech at the National Archives in Washington had gone out to several hundred guests, including congressional leaders and top officials from the Biden Administration. Billed as the main event of his visit in late September, it would give him a chance to inspire U.S. support against Russia with the kind of oratory the world has come to expect from Ukraine’s wartime President. It did not go as planned. 
That afternoon, Zelensky’s meetings at the White House and the Pentagon delayed him by more than an hour, and when he finally arrived to begin his speech at 6:41 p.m., he looked distant and agitated. He relied on his wife, First Lady Olena Zelenska, to carry his message of resilience on the stage beside him, while his own delivery felt stilted, as though he wanted to get it over with. At one point, while handing out medals after the speech, he urged the organizer to hurry things along.

WNU Editor: The Russian press is having a field day on this Time article .... Zelensky ‘feels betrayed’ by West – Time (RT), and here .... Aides believe Zelensky is ‘delusional’ – Time (RT).  There are also runors that Ukraine President Zelensky will be firing Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny .... Tensions Rising Between Zelensky and Top Brass Over Ukraine Counteroffensive (Sputnik).
As to what is my take.
The West is distancing itself away from the Russia - Ukraine war, and they are certainly distancing themselves from Ukraine President Zelensky.]]></summary>

Oil prices could rise to more than $150 a barrel if the conflict in the Middle East escalates, according to the World Bank. 
A drawn-out war in the region could drive big rises in energy and food prices, just a year after prices spiked due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
For now oil prices remain steady at around $90 a barrel and are predicted to fall. 
However, the Bank warns that this outlook could quickly reverse. 
Under its worst case scenario, the World Bank said a situation could develop that was comparable with the oil crisis of the 1970s, which would could push oil prices up to between $140 and $157 a barrel.

The Hill: Johnson suggests Israel-only aid bill could come to House floor this week 
Newly elected Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Sunday said a standalone bill for Israel aid will come to the House floor this week, sending an indication that President Biden’s request for aid to Ukraine will be further delayed. 
“We’re going to move a stand-alone Israel funding bill this week in the House. I know our colleagues, our Republican colleagues in the Senate, have a similar measure,” Johnson said in an interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The Cradle: Leaked: Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza

Times of Israel: Far from Gaza hardships, Hamas chief and family enjoy easy life in Qatar

 
Thanks to Doha’s sponsorship and the wealth he accumulated as Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh and his children today live a life of wealth and privileges denied to other Gazans 
Shortly after the start of Hamas’s brutal attack against Israel on October 7, a video began circulating of the terror group’s leader Ismail Haniyeh in his elegant office in the Qatari capital Doha, watching the bloody onslaught unfold on Al Jazeera and “prostrating in gratitude” with a group of other Hamas officials for the killing of over 1,300 Israelis, among them at least 1,000 civilians.
For years, Haniyeh has been rebuked by many Palestinians for leading a comfortable life away from the hardships of Gaza in the oil-rich Gulf monarchy, which offers shelter to the terror group’s leaders and an internationally recognized platform to spread its propaganda through Al Jazeera.

The Federalist: No Mitch McConnell, Ukraine Aid Is Not ‘Rebuilding Our Industrial Base’ 
Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to reassure Ukrainian aid skeptics that billions in foreign assistance is being spent on American manufacturers to build weapons at home. 
“If you look at the Ukraine assistance,” McConnell said on CBS, “a significant portion of what’s being spent in the United States and 38 different states, replacing the weapons that we send to Ukraine with more modern weapons, so we’re rebuilding our industrial base.” 
But a closer examination of the aid for Ukraine reveals an overwhelming majority of taxpayer dollars are going overseas. Just a fraction of the $113 billion spent has gone to “rebuilding our industrial base.”

The aircraft flew only with its primer paint and a small serial number (20-0003) on its twin tails, and will receive its final colors and insignias before the delivery to the U.S. Air Force.

RT:  Multiple US bases attacked with missiles and drones – media

 
Militias in Iraq and Syria have defied American warnings and vowed to keep up the strikes 
 Iran-backed militias have attacked four US bases in Iraq and Syria in a 24-hour period, Al-Mayadeen news reported on Sunday. The attacks came after US forces launched airstrikes against Iranian targets in both countries. 
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced on Sunday that it had targeted the al-Shaddadi base in eastern Syria on Saturday with two drones, and launched rockets at another American base in the al-Omar oil field near Deir ez-Zor, Lebanon-based news channel Al-Mayadeen reported.

Total is greater than the individual populations of 41 states  
More than 10 million people have been reported illegally entering the United States since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the greatest number in history and of any administration. 
They total more than the individual populations of 41 states. 
The number of people illegally entering the country surged after Biden and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas halted many preexisting border security policies, advanced sweeping parole and other policies to release the greatest number of illegal foreign nationals into the country, encouraged people from all over the world to use a phone app to enter the U.S., and facilitated U.S. entry application processes in foreign countries, among others.

Israel has urged Russia to protect "all its citizens and all Jews" after a large mob stormed a Dagestan airport, some shouting antisemitic slogans. 
Video footage apparently from the scene shows an angry crowd running in the airport in Makhachkala, reportedly seeking people arriving from Tel Aviv. 
Some of the crowd ran onto the runway and surrounded aircraft there. 
Russia's aviation agency said the situation was under control after authorities had arrived on the scene.

	"This is not an insurrection," he insisted. "Antisemitism is not a cudgel to be used against people for political points. Nor is Islamophobia or racism or anti-gay behavior or misogyny or any other kind of bigotry."

Thousands of people storm food warehouses in Gaza to take flour and basic needs in a mark of growing desperation. 
The United Nations relief agency says thousands of Palestinians, desperate due to three weeks of total siege and bombing, broke into several of its warehouses in the Gaza Strip, taking wheat, flour and other basic goods. 
“This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege,” said Thomas White, director of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CBS host Margaret Brennan grilled Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) on Sunday after he said he opposed aid to children in Gaza because he insisted it would go to the terror group Hamas. 
While Vance agreed that there are "a lot of innocent people in Gaza," he insisted that terrorists would intercept the aid packages.
"So if you deliver a large amount of humanitarian assistance, who's it going to go to?" he asked. "The children in Gaza or to the Hamas fighters on the front line? I fear it's going to go to Hamas."
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

Brennan pointed out that international organizations like the Red Cross were distributing the aid.
"But I think there's still a lot of evidence with a lot of these international organizations that when we send aid into Gaza, a lot of it goes into the wrong hands," Vance said. "We don't want to basically fund two sides of the exact same conflict. Fund Hamas, fund Israel."

"Well, it's not aid to Hamas," Brennan observed. "It's aid to the Palestinian people."
"And if I could wave a magic wand and give aid to the Palestinian children, I will," Vance quipped.

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
