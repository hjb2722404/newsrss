        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York Times: Did Aliens Land on Earth in 1945? A Defense Bill Seeks Answers. 
For the casual student of U.F.O. history, the modern idea of life beyond our planet usually dates to 1947, when a top-secret U.S. military balloon crashed in the desert near Roswell, N.M. The wreckage prompted decades of conspiracy theories and gave rise to the idea that Roswell was the site of an alien crash landing. 
Now, thanks to a new congressional spending bill, U.F.O. enthusiasts may look to 1945 as the beginning of that era. 
An amendment tucked into this year’s $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the Defense Department’s annual operating budget, requires the department to review historical documents related to unidentified aerial phenomena — government lingo for U.F.O.s — dating to 1945. That is the year that, according to one account, a large, avocado-shaped object struck a communication tower in a patch of New Mexico desert now known as the Trinity Site, where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated that July. 
Experts said the bill, which President Biden signed into law in December, could be a game changer for studying unidentified phenomena.

US News and World Report: China Signals Military Response as U.S., Japan Accelerate Defense Plans  
Dramatic escalations in Japan’s own military investments combined with new security cooperation with the U.S. announced this week prompted new warnings from Beijing. 
China on Thursday signaled plans to retaliate militarily to new security initiatives between Japan and the U.S., warning that the allies’ accelerated cooperation will create new threats for themselves in the region. 
Citing a Chinese military analyst, the English-language Global Times newspaper warned that if Japan continued dramatic increases in military spending and new security postures coordinated with the U.S. – particularly with regard to Taiwan – then the Chinese military “is sure to take countermeasures, including holding more exercises and patrols in international waters and airspace around Japan.”

Business Insider: Ongoing headaches with F-35 fighter jets are rippling through the rest of the US military's combat aircraft fleet 
* The F-35 program has been plagued by years of delays, cost overruns, and technical glitches. 
* Those problems have prompted the Pentagon to extend the service lives of older combat jets. 
* Extensions keep jets flying but don't guarantee they will meet future needs, a government watchdog says. 
Years of delays, cost overruns, and technical glitches with the F-35 have put the Pentagon in a dilemma. 
If F-35s aren't fit to fly in sufficient numbers, then older aircraft such as the F-16 must be kept in service to fill the gap. 
In turn, having to extend the lifespan of older planes consumes money that could be used to acquire new aircraft and results in aging warplanes that may not be capable of fulfilling their missions on the current battlefield. 
"While service life extension programs are one way to keep current aircraft capable and in operation, they do not guarantee that those aircraft will be available when needed or that they will possess required capabilities to meet future needs," the Government Accountability Office warned in a new report on US tactical aircraft.

Michael T. Klare, The Nation: A Pentagon Report on China Fuels a Military Spending Frenzy in the US  
How the media is misrepresenting what’s in the document. 
“China to Have 1,500 Nuclear Warheads by 2035: Pentagon.” That was the headline at ABC News on November 29, the day the Department of Defense released the 2022 edition of its annual report on “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” also called the China Military Power report. The Pentagon’s claim that China’s nuclear stockpile would jump from some 400 warheads today to an estimated 1,500 in 2035 was widely reported in the popular media and seized upon by military hawks in Congress to clamor for increased military spending. During the first two weeks of December, the House and Senate authorized a fiscal year 2023 Pentagon budget of $858 billion—some $45 billion more than President Biden requested, with most of the added funds earmarked for weaponry to counter China.

WNU Editor: 2022 will be remembered as the year where the old world geopolitical order was turned upside down. 2023 will be remembered as the year where countries responded to this change by forming alliances and massively expanding their defense budgets. A Pentagon report is not the reason for this "military spending frenzy". But it will be used by US political leaders as one of many reasons why this military buildup is justified.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Navy Secretary Carlos del Toro is 'concerned' that within the next six months the US Navy won’t be able to arm both itself AND Ukraine – urging contractors to boost production to meet the demand 
* Navy Secretary Carlos del Toro admitted there are 'concerns' about America's weapons supply as the US continues to arm Ukraine 
* He said that if the conflict in Ukraine continues for the next six month it will 'stress the supply chain' 
* Del Toro urged military contractors to increase production 
* Adm. Daryl Caudle also accused military contractors of using the pandemic as an excuse not to supply weapons on time 
Navy Secretary Carlos del Toro admitted that there are 'concerns' about America's weapons cache as the government continues to arm Ukraine. 
The Secretary was asked at a Surface Navy Association Conference on Wednesday whether he agreed with an admiral's statement that 'The Navy might get to the point where it has to make the decision whether it needs to arm itself or arm Ukraine.' 
He was very careful not to comment on the possibility of a choice between which country to arm, according to Defense One, but noted that 'if the conflict does go on for another six months, for another year, it certainly continues to stress the supply chain in ways that are challenging.'

Forbes: The U.S. Fleet Could Lose Four Aircraft Carriers Defending Taiwan 
The U.S. Navy’s fleet of 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers fared poorly in a series of war games, simulating a Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2026, that the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. recently organized. 
Even when the United States and Japan successfully defended Taiwan—as they did in most of CSIS’s 24 simulations—the Navy lost at least two carriers ... and sometimes as many as four. 
And it happened fast. “Typically, the United States lost both forward-deployed carriers within the first turn or two,” CSIS analysts Mark Cancian, Matthew Cancian and Eric Heginbotham explained in their summary of the war games. A turn represented 3.5 days of fighting. 
While the carriers were getting blasted by Chinese missiles, the Navy’s nuclear-powered attack submarines and the U.S. Air Force’s heavy bombers not only were dodging Chinese attacks for the most part, they also were managing to sink more than enough Chinese ships to win the war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday he seriously doubted that ramped up Chinese military activities near the Taiwan Strait were a sign of an imminent invasion of the island by Beijing. 
"We've seen increased aerial activity in the straits, we've seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan," Austin said during a press conference alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts. 
"But whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, you know, I seriously doubt that," Austin said.

Surrendering weapons is a central part of the November ceasefire agreement which seeks to end a conflict that has killed thousands 
Tigrayan rebels have begun handing in heavy weapons, a key part of an agreement signed more than two months ago to end a deadly conflict in northern Ethiopia, a spokesperson for the rebel authorities said. 
The demobilisation of Tigray forces is seen as central to the 2 November ceasefire agreement, alongside the restoration of services, resumption of humanitarian aid and withdrawal of Eritrean troops, who fought alongside Ethiopia’s army but were not party to the truce.

Business Insider: Satellite images showing thousands of craters at a battle site in eastern Ukraine capture just how intense the 'savage' artillery fight there actually is 
* New satellite imagery illustrates the Russian campaign to capture the eastern Ukrainian towns of Bakhmut and Soledar. 
* The photos show thousands of artillery craters and dilapidated, burned down buildings and schools. 
* Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the area is where Russia is focusing its "greatest efforts." 
Stunning new satellite imagery shows the extent of destruction in eastern Ukraine, as fighting between the Ukrainian army and Russian paramilitary forces has ramped up in recent weeks. 
Ukrainian forces have upped the ante in the region that encompasses Bakhmut and Soledar, resisting a Russian attempt to capture the resource-rich area. 
Russian forces have been supported on the frontlines by prisoners recruited by the Wagner Group, a mercenary organization whose leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has close ties to the Kremlin. 
Since the start of January, the fighting in the area has become "savage," a senior US military official said on Monday, adding that many of the 73,000 residents of Bakhmut have been evacuated.

As Republican lawmakers such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) express concern that President Joe Biden’s retention of classified materials from his vice presidency may be “[swept] under the rug,” legal experts told The Epoch Times why Biden and former President Donald Trump appear to have been treated very differently in two strikingly parallel cases.

The warrant said there was probable cause to believe there were “additional documents that contain classified NDI [national defense information]” or “presidential records subject to record retention requirements” at Mar-a-Lago.

Now, as a new year dawns and a renewed cycle of offensives and counter-offensives seems inevitable, they are desperate for the West to give them the most advanced tanks possible, seeing them as vital for the next phase of the war.

WNU Editor: I am sure these tanks will help Ukraine in this war. But the Russians also have the means to destroy them like the Ukrainians do, and these tanks will have a lot of problems over long supply chains to receive the fuel that they need to conduct operations. 
Ukraine has been experiencing fuel and diesel shortages since the start of the war. Supporting a tank force that will make a difference on the battlefield will only make these shortages worse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday he seriously doubted that ramped up Chinese military activities near the Taiwan Strait were a sign of an imminent invasion of the island by Beijing.
"We've seen increased aerial activity in the straits, we've seen increased surface vessel activity around Taiwan," Austin said during a press conference alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts.
"But whether or not that means that an invasion is imminent, you know, I seriously doubt that," Austin said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday mocked Russian claims to have taken over parts of the eastern city of Soledar, saying that fighting was still going on.
Russian mercenary group Wagner on Tuesday claimed it had taken full control of Soledar but that fighting continued in the city centre. Soledar is a salt-mining town near the city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of a Russian assault aimed at capturing the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
"The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that part of our town of Soledar ... is some sort of a Russian possession," Zelenskiy said in a video address.
"But fighting continues. The Donetsk theatre of operations is holding."
In a separate statement on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the Russians were suffering heavy losses as they tried to take Soledar and cut off the supply routes for pro-Kyiv units.

Donelan told BBC radio a deal reportedly negotiated by the British Museum's chairman, George Osborne, was not about the permanent return to Greece of the ancient sculptures.
That was "not his intention", Donelan said referring to Osborne, a former finance minister under ex-prime minister David Cameron.
Such a move would "open a can of worms" and "open the gateway to the question of the entire contents of our museums", she said.
The sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, were taken from the Parthenon temple at the Acropolis in Athens in the early 19th century by British diplomat Tho…]]></summary>

Washington Free Beacon: Iran To Station Warships in Panama Canal  
Iran entering Pacific Ocean for first time Iran's navy is set to station warships for the first time in the Panama Canal, a critical trade route in America's backyard that has never before seen an Iranian military presence.
Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, the commander of Iran's navy, said on Wednesday that his forces will establish a presence in the Panama Canal later this year, marking the first time Iran's military has entered the Pacific Ocean. 
Iran in recent years has placed a greater focus on moving its military into Latin American territories as it strengthens relations with anti-American dictators in the region, most notably in Venezuela. 
Iranian vessels have docked more frequently in Venezuela as Tehran's hardline regime seeks to prop up dictator Nicolás Maduro. 
These moves are meant to provoke the United States and signal that Tehran has the ability to station its military apparatus a stone's throw from U.S. territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peru's top prosecutor's office on Tuesday said it launched an inquiry into new President Dina Boluarte and members of her cabinet over violent clashes that have seen at least 40 killed and hundreds injured since early December.
The inquiry comes after 17 civilians were killed in the country's southern Puno region on Monday - the most lethal day of protests since former President Pedro Castillo was ousted and detained last month. The violence continued on Tuesday with a police officer dying after his car was torched. 
The attorney general's office said it was investigating Boluarte along with Prime Minister Alberto Otarola, Defense Minister Jorge Chavez and Interior Minister Victor Rojas on charges of "genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In death as in life, Cardinal George Pell split opinion in Australia: while believers on Wednesday mourned the passing of a "great churchman", sexual abuse survivors said they would shed no tears.
One of the most powerful figures in the Roman Catholic Church, Pell died at the age of 81 on Tuesday in Rome due to heart complications following a hip operation.
The man who was convicted, jailed and then cleared of molesting two 13-year-old choirboys in the 1990s remains deeply polarizing.
"It was very sad personal news to hear and quite a shock," said Archbishop of Melbourne Peter Comensoli.
But Phillip Nagle, an abuse survivor in Victoria, said he believed Pell knew more about sexual abuse than he let on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's sports associations have been told to include "China" in their official names or risk having funding pulled, as authorities embrace nationalism after quashing democracy protests.
The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China confirmed to AFP on Wednesday that its member associations have until July 1 to complete the name change.
Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China but competes separately from the country in international sports, including at the Olympics.
Fewer than 20 of the 83 Hong Kong sports organizations listed on the Olympic Committee's website have "China" in their names.
There is the Hong Kong China Swimming Association for example. However, Hong Kong's football association currently has no reference to China in its name.

The Gare du Nord is a busy commuter hub which also serves as a departure point for trains to northern France, London and northern Europe.
Police were treating the stabbings as attempted murder, not as a terrorist attack, a source close to the case said.
The attacker's motive was not immediately clear.
One of the six people was seriously wounded in the attack at 6:42 am (0542 GMT), while the other five sustained light injuries, prosecutors said.
The entire incident was over within two minutes, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters at the scene.
It was not immediately clear what type of weapon the attacker had used.

"Such widespread, preventable tragedy should never be accepted as inevitable. Progress is possible with stronger political will and targeted investment in equitable access to primary health care for every woman and child," Ganesh added.

The Duke of Sussex's ghostwritten memoir "Spare" specifically details Harry's rifts with his family — namely with his father King Charles and his older brother Prince William — Harry's prior controversies, his decision to leave his senior royal role and his decision to part ways with the royal family alongside wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex. Prior to its Jan. 10 release, "Spare" was the talk of the year as several outlets leaked a few of its most damning bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Bogdan Kochubey
KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy stripped four political figures of their Ukrainian citizenship on Tuesday, including pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk who was transferred to Russia last year in a prisoner swap deal.
"I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons: Andriy Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak, Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin and Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
"If people's deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate."
Medvedchuk, a close ally of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, headed a banned pro-Russian party the "Opposition Platform - For Life" in Ukraine and was facing treason charges before being transferred to Moscow in September 2022.
Kozak and Kuzmin had been both elected to Ukraine's parliament as members of Medvedchuk's party.
The United States imposed sanctions on Kozak, the owner of three television channels, in January of 2022 for alleged spreading of Russian disinformation, after Kyiv sought his arrest on treason charges.
Ukraine has also charged Kuzmin with high treason.
Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker also sanctioned by Washington, was charged in the United States in December with money laundering and sanctions violations.
He had been accused of helping Russia interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thousands of "hostile" web attacks launched from Russian IP addresses have targeted an online auction of prints by British graffiti artist Banksy in aid of Ukraine, the charity Legacy of War Foundation said Tuesday.
The elusive street artist is selling 50 new limited edition screen-prints through the charity to raise funds to support Ukrainian civilians affected by conflict.
To get one of the £5,000 ($6,080) prints, which show a mouse sliding down the side of a box with "FRAGILE" printed on it, supporters have to register online with the charity.
But a message posted on its website said it had "received over 1 million requests (and 3,500 hostile attacks from Russian IP addresses), so we would appreciate your patience at this time".
"We are currently sifting through the registered entries and will notify successful applicants shortly," it added.
Banksy previously said he supported the charity as he had seen one of its teams "sweep in and provide medical attention, heaters, fresh water and a friendly face to some very desperate people in a bombed-out building".
The artist confirmed he was behind seven murals that appeared on destroyed buildings around Kyiv last year.

There’s been talk of Macron renewing his pensions reform for months – but everyone knows the broad outline. The centerpiece of the legislation will be raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, and increasing the number of years people must have worked to qualify for a full pension.

PARIS (Reuters) -The French should work two years longer before they can retire, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said, detailing an unpopular reform of the pension system that risks strikes and will test President Emmanuel Macron's ability to deliver change.
The long-delayed overhaul pushes the retirement age to 64, a move opposed by four in every five citizens according to an Odoxa poll, at a time when many are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis.
"I'm well aware that changing our pension system raises questions and fears among the French," Borne said on Tuesday, adding that her government would work on convincing the French that the reform was necessary.

Daniel Edmund Duggan was arrested in Australia late last year and now faces extradition to the United States, where he is accused of violating an arms embargo.
The 54-year-old was a highly-regarded jet pilot who spent 12 years in the US Marine Corps, reaching the rank of Major and working as a tactical flight instructor.
An indictment filed in 2016 -- but only unsealed in December last year -- alleged Duggan broke US arms control laws by providing "defence services" to "Chinese foreign nationals" after he left the military.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo doubled down on its ridicule of Iran's religious rulers on Tuesday, with fresh cartoons of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei despite protests from Iran and its allies.
"The mullahs aren't happy. The caricatures of their supreme leader... do not seem to have made them laugh," the paper's editor, known as "Riss", writes in the latest edition, which hits newsstands on Wednesday.
"Laughing at themselves has never been a strong point of tyrants," he added.
The paper was hit by a cyber attack after publishing cartoons of Khamenei in last week's special edition, which marked the anniversary of the 2015 attack on its Paris offices that left 12 dead.
"A digital attack doesn't leave anyone dead, but it sets the tone. The mullah's regime feels in such danger that it considers it vital to its existence to hack the website of a French newspaper," Riss wrote.
"It is an honour in one sense, but above all proves that they feel their power is very fragile."
There have been months of protests in Iran sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a woman arrested for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code.
Iran issued an official warning to France over the "insulting and indecent" cartoons in last week's Charlie Hebdo.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian movement in Lebanon, also condemned the cartoons, saying Khamenei was not just a ruler but "a religious symbol for tens of millions of believers".]]></summary>

Similar protests by Tesla owners have sprung up in cities including Henan, Wuxi and Hangzhou in recent days, according to owners and social media posts. Tesla has faced online backlash over previous price cuts in China before but nothing as widespread as the current spontaneous protests.
The groups protesting across China were in touch with each other and would continue to press Tesla to offer them some compensation, said Damon Yu, 29, who bought a Model Y in September.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 11 people have died in storms across the Philippines in the past week, with more heavy rain expected in already sodden regions of the disaster-prone country, authorities said Tuesday.
Bad weather has plagued the country's southern and central islands since the Christmas weekend when downpours triggered flooding and landslides that left 52 people dead and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
Since January 3, back-to-back storms have killed 11 people as floodwaters swept through houses, cut roads and swamped crops, the civil defense office said.
The state weather forecaster warned Tuesday of "serious flooding" in low-lying areas and landslides in the mountains of the central island of Samar.
Heavy rain has already inundated villages, with water levels reaching three meters (10 feet) in some places.
So far, one person was missing and more than 2,200 people had been evacuated from their homes, said Josh Echano, Northern Samar provincial disaster officer.
The number of evacuees was expected to rise.
"The flood is progressing since yesterday, it's not subsiding," Echano said.
"This could be fatal. This could be one of the worst (floods)."
The Philippines is ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, and scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's attempt to become the first European nation to launch satellites into space ended in bitter disappointment early on Tuesday when Virgin Orbit said its rocket had suffered an anomaly that prevented it from reaching orbit.
The "horizontal launch" mission had left from the coastal town of Newquay in southwest England, with Virgin's LauncherOne rocket carried under the wing of a modified Boeing 747 called "Cosmic Girl", and later released over the Atlantic Ocean.
"We appear to have an anomaly that has prevented us from reaching orbit," the company said. "We are evaluating the information."
The failure deals a further blow to European space ambitions after an Italian-built Vega-C rocket mission failed after lift-off from French Guiana in late December.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brown hillsides and slivers of snow -- a common sight across Europe's Alps, and a far cry from the winter wonderland tourists had banked on.
While some snow started to fall again early this week, Europe has seen "extreme" warm winter weather in recent days, experts say, with 2023 already posting record January temperatures across the region.
From Austria to France, Italy and Switzerland, slopes have melted away -- with temperatures too high even to make artificial snow.
Many lower-lying resorts have had to close, while others are offering reduced services.
"In the last days it's not been cold or wintery... so winter holidaymakers probably don't really feel like skiing," Nazar Nydza, managing director of the Semmering Hirschenkogel Bergbahnen told AFP.

The epicentre of the quake was 427 kilometres (265 miles) south of the Indonesian island of Ambon at a depth of 95 kilometres, the US Geological Survey reported.
Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said the tremor was felt on the eastern islands of Timor, the Maluku archipelago and Papua. It reported some aftershocks at a magnitude of 5.5.
"I was in bed, then I felt a little shake. I woke up and found out that many of my friends felt it too," Hamdi, an Indonesian in Ambon, told AFP.

Military experts brought together by the Center for Strategic and International Studies to wargame the conflict said every likely direct participant in a war -- the United States, China, Taiwan and Japan -- would experience "enormous" losses.
Chinese missiles would likely destroy US air bases in Japan and as far as Guam, and sink two US aircraft carriers and between 10 and 20 destroyers and cruisers as the invasion opened.
But the Chinese invading force itself would be heavily destroyed before it ever occupied any significant part of Taiwan.
Ultimately it would be prevented from its goal of capturing …]]></summary>
