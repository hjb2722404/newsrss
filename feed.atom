* Joe Biden spoke to Ukraine's Volodomyr Zelensky for 41 minutes on Wednesday 
* He told him he was sending another billion dollars in military assistance 
* It is believed to include anti-ship missile systems, rockets and artillery shells 
* It brings the US military aid total to more than $5.5 billion since Russia invaded 
* And it comes amid warnings that Ukraine is struggling to keep up with the pace of Russia's long-range shelling and rocket strikes in a new phase of the war 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced he was sending another one billion dollars in military support to Ukraine, after its leaders pleaded for more ammunition to help fight off the Russian invasion. 
The latest package will include anti-ship missile systems, artillery rockets, and rounds for howitzers, people familiar with the packages said. 
It means the U.S. has now delivered more than $5.5 billion of military support since Russia invaded more than 110 days ago.

Biden says oil companies are earning 'historically high' profits 
President Biden may resort to using emergency powers if American oil companies don't increase output at their refineries, the president told oil CEOs in a series of letters Wednesday. 
Biden's statement blames oil companies for running "historically high profit margins" even as Americans experience surging gas prices. 
Biden has recently faced criticism for a lack of executive action aimed at curbing inflation.

But the exchanges are made and the players retire.  Injuries happen, and so do upsets.  The postseason game is a grueling glove to run, and it just keeps growing.

Deputy Defense Secretary Hicks discusses Russia, China, and inflation’s effects on the Pentagon’s buying power at the 7th Annual Defense One Tech Summit. 
U.S. defense leaders believe Ukraine will survive Russia’s invasion and are already planning on how to arm the country for the long-term, said the Pentagon’s No. 2 civilian official.

It will be a sovereign country and that country will have a military that will need to defend it,” Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said Monday. “And so as we look ahead, we're thinking through what are the kinds of capabilities that the Ukrainians need to protect themselves over the long term.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don Perkins, a six-time Pro Bowl running back with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960s, died Thursday.  He was 84 years old.
The Cowboys and the University of New Mexico, where Perkins was a standout player before his professional career, announced the death.  No announcement said where he died, and none cited the cause.
Perkins rushed for 6,217 yards in 107 games with the Cowboys from 1961 to 1968. He is fourth on the team’s career list behind two Pro Football Hall of Famers – Emmitt Smith, the career leader of the NFL, and Tony Dorsett – and the current Cowboys.  running back, Ezekiel Elliott.  Perkins’ 42 rushing touchdowns rank fifth in team history.


While originally drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the ninth round of the 1960 draft, Perkins had already signed a personal services contract with the expansion Cowboys.  Dallas won its rights after sending the Colts a ninth-round draft pick.


Perkins missed the Cowboys’ inaugural season in 1960 with a broken foot.  He ran for 815 yards in 1961 and finished third in voting for NFL Rookie of the Year, behind Mike Ditka and Fran Tarkenton.  He had a career-high 945 rushing yards in 1962.


Donald Anthony Perkins was born on March 4, 1938 in Waterloo, Iowa.  He played for New Mexico from 1957 to 1959 and captained the team in its final two seasons.  The Lobos’ coach at the time, future Hall of Famer Marv Levy, said Perkins was one of the greatest players he ever coached.
Perkins returned to the Albuquerque area after his professional football career ended.  He then worked as a television and radio football analyst.


Information about survivors was not immediately available.
“Don is one of the greatest Lobos, and certainly one of the greatest football players to play for UNM,” New Mexico athletic director Eddie Nuñez said.  “He came back to New Mexico and worked for the state and was a tremendous ambassador for so many people.”

GENEVA (Reuters) - Any Chinese military attack on Taiwan would have a greater impact on global trade flows than the Ukraine war, Taipei's top trade negotiator told Reuters on Tuesday, saying it would lead to a shortage of semiconductor chips. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February has triggered commodity price hikes and food export bans, leading to fears of famine in poorer countries. 
John Deng said that, were China to attack Taiwan, the potential disruptions could be worse, citing the world's reliance on Taiwan for chips used in electric vehicles and mobile phones.

🇹🇼Taiwan’s legislative speaker reveals its mass produced supersonic cruise missiles, Yun Fong, are capable to attack Beijing.https://t.co/Y0q3ewVGw3

   Warzone/The Drive: Taiwan Official Warns Supersonic Cruise Missile Can Strike Beijing 
As China’s hostility intensifies, a top Taiwanese official warns that the Yun Feng supersonic cruise missile can reach out and touch Beijing. 
You Si Kun, President of Taiwan’s Legislative Assembly, or Yuan, gave a speech on Taiwan Overseas Network where he declared that the country’s domestically produced Yun Feng supersonic cruise missile is capable of reaching Beijing. The message follows ominous warnings made by Chinese military officials directly to their U.S. counterparts to avoid the Taiwan Strait, claiming it is not international waters. However, the United States, along with the vast majority of the international community, does not accept China’s claims in this regard. This also comes as U.S. President Joe Biden recently vowed to defend Taiwan amid a crisis, although the statement was walked back to a degree, leaving allies to question how a crisis could pan out.

Insider: The US Navy's plan to ditch its cruisers will leave it out of a small and well-armed club 
* The US Navy is trying to retire all of its guided-missile cruisers by 2027. 
* US cruisers are specialized for air defense and are among the best-armed naval ships in service. 
* Lawmakers are dismayed by the Navy plan, believing it will reduce US firepower as China's navy grows.
In April, the US Navy presented an ambitious plan to decommission all 22 of its Ticonderoga-class cruisers by 2027.  The move is not surprising. 
The Navy has tried to rid itself of its cruisers for years, but Congress has consistently rejected its proposals, largely out of concern that decommissioning them would take away a much-needed weapon as China's naval force continues to grow. 
With the retirement of the last battleships nearly 20 years ago, cruisers are the largest surface combatants — a category that generally doesn't include aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships — in service.

But like so many top seeds over the years, the Volunteers couldn’t navigate the NCAA baseball playoffs and were eliminated without even qualifying for the eight-team University World Series.
The playoffs started well for Tennessee.  After a 53-7 regular season and a Southeastern Conference title and No. 1 ranking, Tennessee was swept away by lesser competition in the early rounds.
But he met surprising opposition from Notre-Dame in the super regional, the round of 16 stage.
Notre Dame was one of the best unranked teams in the tournament, but they weren’t expected to beat a Tennessee team which had a home batting host and the best ERA in Division I. Tennessee also had the advantage of play…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Russian court on Tuesday extended the pretrial detention of WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner on drug trafficking charges until July 2, pushing her stay in prison beyond four months, according to the official TASS news agency.
The Moscow region Khimki court granted the 18-day extension at the request of investigators, the agency said citing the court’s press service.  It is typical for Russian courts to prolong detention several times until trial.  Ms Griner’s lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The American basketball star was arrested four months ago after Russian officials said they found vape cartridges containing traces of hash oil in her luggage as she walked through Sheremetyevo airport, the Moscow’s main international airport.  The charge carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.


Ms Griner was arrested on February 17, a week before Russia invaded Ukraine, but authorities did not reveal she was detained until days after the war began, raising fears that not be used as a bargaining chip in the global crisis.  There has been speculation that once convicted, Ms Griner could be part of a prisoner swap with the United States.


Two-time Olympic gold medalist Ms. Griner plays for the Phoenix Mercury and US officials meet with the team on Monday to discuss efforts to secure his release.  In May, the State Department said it determined Ms Griner had been “wrongfully detained.”
When taken into custody, Ms Griner was returning to Russia to perform for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team.  Many WNBA players supplement their income the league’s off-season playing internationally.

OilPrice.com: Libya Loses 1.1 Million Bpd As It Shuts Down Nearly All Its Oil Fields 
Libya is losing oil production at the rate of 1.1 million barrels daily, the country’s oil minister Mohammed Aoun has said, adding that almost all of the country’s oil fields were shut down. 
Libya’s largest field, El Sharara, was shut down last month along with El Feel, with reports saying that it was groups affiliated with the eastern parliament that shut down oil production, among them the Libyan National Army of Halifa Khaftar. 
According to Aoun, however, “it appears that the closure instructions were issued by an official body, the Petroleum Facilities Guard in the closure areas.”

France 24: Macron calls for French budget defence boost in 'war economy' 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday called for a boost to defence budgets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying France was now on a "war economy" footing. 
Speaking at Eurosatory, a weapons industry fair, Macron said Europe needed "a much larger defence industry" to avoid relying on suppliers elsewhere for its equipment needs. 
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, France "has entered into a war economy in which I believe we will find ourselves for a long time".

Washington Post: For Ukrainian troops, a need arises: Javelin customer service 
The Ukrainians had an urgent problem. Their Javelin missile launchers — sophisticated, finicky gear each costing six figures — were inoperable and no one in their unit could fix them. 
They sought help from two Americans, who engineered a fix for one by cannibalizing electrical components from a video game controller, said Mark Hayward, a U.S. Army veteran and volunteer trainer. 
The others, he said, were thought to be broken until it was discovered that the user instructions had gotten gummed up in Google Translate. 
Hayward recalled the episode with profound frustration that the Pentagon, which has rushed more than 5,000 Javelins to Ukraine, hasn’t done more to ensure that those battling Russian forces have help when such needs arise.

Pope Francis on June 14 asserted that World War III had already commenced, referring to the conflicts that have been taking place across the world in recent months. 
The pontiff went on to say that "we see" what is occurring in Ukraine in a different light because it is closer to us and pricks our senses more, however, "no one cares" about the fights taking place in parts of Africa, northern Nigeria, northern Congo, and Myanmar. 
  According to Vatican News, the pontiff said, "We see what is happening now in Ukraine in a certain way because it is closer to us and pricks our sensibilities more.

WNU Editor: I was surprised at the appearance of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at today's NATO meeting (see above). As a former politician, diplomat, and now leader of NATO, he knows that it is a rule for people in these positions to always look clean shaven, neat, and sharp looking. 
He definitely did not look like that today. In fact, he looked like shit. His tie was crooked, hair was messed-up, and this is the first time that I have seen him unshaven. 
Optics and perception is important to political leaders like Jens Stoltenberg. They always take the time to look good. My gut tells me that he is becoming stressed by the Russia - Ukraine war, or more to the point, the intelligence that he has access to is painting a very grim picture on what is really happening in eastern Ukraine. 
Long meetings. Continuous bad news. NATO members with their own agendas. Keeping a unified message among the alliance. It looks like being clean-cut for the cameras was not the priority for Jens Stoltenberg's at today's meeting.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Ukraine strikes back: Kyiv blasts military base 40 miles inside Russian border in early morning rocket attack

Ukraine is thought to have struck a military base 40 miles inside Russia in an early-morning missile attack.  Footage showed what appeared to be a missile trail in the sky over the town of Klintsy early Tuesday, accompanied by a plume of smoke rising from a nearby base. 
Troops and helicopters then arrived to inspect what appeared to be a bomb crater, as local Telegram channels reported a fire spreading to a nearby apartment block.

Russian forces have destroyed the last bridge linking the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk to a Ukrainian held city on the other side of the river, cutting off all routes of evacuation for those remaining in the city, a Ukrainian official said on Monday evening. 
Sergei Gaidai, the governor of Lugansk, said on social media that some 70% of Sievierodonetsk was now under Russian control, describing the situation for Ukrainian soldiers holding out in the city as "difficult, but under control". 
At the same time, the destruction of the last bridge across the river to the twin city of Lysychansk meant that it was impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies, he said, nor remove any civilians still in Sievierodonetsk.

Wall Street Journal: Ukraine Has Begun Moving Sensitive Data Outside Its Borders  
Some government databases are already on cloud servers in Poland, and officials are negotiating similar arrangements with France, Estonia and several other nations 
Ukrainian government officials have begun storing sensitive data outside the country to protect it from Russian cyber and physical assault, and are negotiating with several European nations to move more databases abroad. 
Since the start of the war, around 150 registries from different government ministries and offices, or backup copies of them, have been moved abroad or are in discussions to be transferred, said George Dubinskiy, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. 
Previously, much of the government’s information trove was held in data centers in Ukraine, and needed first to be moved to the cloud before backup copies could be transferred, he said. 
The government prioritized important databases to move from old legacy data-storage systems, and created copies of those registries for storage in clouds outside Ukraine, he said. 
“To be on the safe side, we want to have our backups abroad,” Mr. Dubinskiy said.  Moving databases to the cloud adds a layer of security because government officials can still access it even if a data center in Ukraine were demolished by Russian weapons, he said. 
The government specified legal and security provisions to help protect the databases from cyber and other threats, he added.

CNN: US expects announcements of more weapons to Ukraine in meeting of nearly 50 countries

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) -Armed men killed at least 100 civilians in a rural district of northern Burkina Faso close to the border with Niger over the weekend, a security source said. 
The attackers targeted men but appeared to spare women and children in Seytenga district on Saturday night, the security source and two other sources said, all speaking on condition of anonymity. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the assault happened in borderlands where militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are waging an insurgency.

VOA: Ethiopia PM Says Committee Created to Negotiate With Tigray Forces 
Addis Ababa — Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has announced the formation of a committee to begin peace talks with Tigray forces after 18 months of war. 
Abiy spoke to parliament on Tuesday about the conflict in comments broadcast on state television.  “We need to repeat the victory that we made on the battlefield in peace talks,” he said adding that the war is hindering the country’s development. “Every bullet that is shot is like a dollar lost.”
Abiy said that the committee would be led by Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen and would be given 10 to 15 days to decide what will be up for negotiation.

Issue may derail alliance summit as Ankara digs in on accusation that Nordic countries harbour terrorists 
Turkey has said it is willing to delay Swedish and Finnish membership of Nato for more than a year unless it receives satisfactory assurances that the two Nordic countries are willing to address support for Kurdish groups it regards as terrorist organisations. 
Finland’s prime minister said on Tuesday that the two nations’ Nato applications could stall if the issue is not resolved before a vital Nato summit due to start in Madrid on 29 June. 
Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring alleged members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and also objects to their decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to Ankara due to Turkey’s military operations in Syria.

El Pais: Nicaragua’s Ortega strains US relations by expanding military ties with Russia 
President Daniel Ortega welcomes more Russian military personnel and equipment to be stationed throughout Nicaragua 
With relations between Nicaragua and the United States at its lowest point in years, former Sandinista guerrilla and current president Daniel Ortega’s new accord with Russia has just added fuel to the fire. Vladimir Putin’s propaganda machine kicked into high gear to publicize the Nicaraguan government’s recent announcement that it will begin receiving more Russian military personnel, ships, and aircraft starting July 1. Ortega’s regime has dubbed it “a military exchange, instruction, and training initiative to support humanitarian aid operations.” The announcement of this new Russian collaboration with Nicaragua follows Ortega’s defiance of the United States and the European Union when he supported Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Ortega’s apparent diplomatic strategy is to use such initiatives to alleviate his country’s economic pain caused by international isolation and sanctions.

Zero Hedge: Mexico President Slams "Immoral" NATO Proxy War in Ukraine 
The president of Mexico has condemned NATO's approach to the war in Ukraine - labelling it "immoral." 
“How easy it is to say, 'Here, I’ll send you this much money for weapons.' Couldn’t the war in Ukraine have been avoided? Of course it could,” said President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. 
López Obrador didn't elaborate on how, but fair to say a peaceful resolution would have centered on the negotiation of: 
* Some form of independence for the eastern Ukraine provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk 
* A Ukraine government pledge that it will not join NATO 
* Ukraine's recognition that Crimea is now part of Russia 
The increasingly dismal prospects for Ukraine's military now seem to point to a negotiated end to the war that embraces those same three elements, but perhaps with Donetsk and Luhansk—which together comprise the Donbas region—joining Russia outright.

19FortyFive: There Is No Military Path for Ukraine To ‘Defeat’ Russia 
The Tide of Battle – and Mounting Casualties – Turning Against Ukraine – Since it became evident a few weeks into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that Moscow’s troops were stopped cold outside of Kyiv, there has been a near-universal belief in the West that Ukraine would eventually win. All that was needed, many pundits claimed, was to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces sufficient numbers of weapons and ammunition. As the war now grinds towards the four-month mark, it is becoming painfully evident that the odds are stacked in Russia’s favor. 
Militarily speaking, there is no rational path through which Ukraine will ever win its war. Without a course correction – and soon – Kyiv itself may not ultimately be safe.    
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: You know the situation is deteriorating fast when Ukraine President Zelensky's top adviser is making an urgent request to NATO at their meeting this Wednesday for these weapons (see tweet below). 
Ukraine had most of these weapons before the war, and to me this adviser is admitting that they now need to be replaced because most have been lost and destroyed. A testament to how brutal this war is becoming. 
I am also being told by one source in Ukraine that I trust that the Ukrainian military losses are not 100 - 200 soldiers a day, but two to three times that. If true, these numbers are staggering, and you cannot sustain a war with that type of losses, let alone mounting a counter-offensive to defeat the Russian military. 

Being straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity:
 1000 howitzers caliber 155 mm;
 300 MLRS;
 500 tanks;
 2000 armored vehicles;
 1000 drones.
Contact Group of Defense Ministers meeting is held in #Brussels on June 15. We are waiting for a decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Image credit: SpaceX)  SpaceX: SpaceX beating Russian jamming attack was ‘eyewatering’: DoD official  
“The way that Starlink was able to upgrade when a threat showed up, we need to be able to have that ability," said Dave Tremper, the Pentagon's director of electronic warfare. "We have to be able to change our electromagnetic posture, to be able to change very dynamically what we're trying to do without losing capability along the way.”  
WASHINGTON: The US military’s electronic warfare enterprise needs to take a page from SpaceX when it comes to responding to new threats, the Pentagon’s director for electromagnetic warfare said today.  After SpaceX sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine in February in an apparent effort to help Ukraine maintain its internet connection amid war with Russia, SpaceX founder Elon Musk claimed that Russia had jammed Starlink terminals in the country for hours at a time. 
After a software update, Starlink was operating normally, said Musk, who added on March 25 that the constellation had “resisted all hacking & jamming attempts” in Ukraine.

Warzone/The Drive: The Afghan Army’s Last Commander On How His Country Really Fell 
Haibatullah Alizai recounts the final five harrowing days of his government and how he reluctantly became the Afghan Army’s last general. 
Though his President and Defense minister fled hours earlier, and with the Taliban fast approaching Kabul, Haibatullah Alizai was not ready to surrender.
It was the evening of Aug. 15, 2021. Alizai, a lauded special operations commander, had been given control of Afghanistan's remaining army just days before. And now he was trying to convince the American Navy SEAL two-star admiral in charge of Kabul security to let him declare martial law and allow his small band of the best troops remaining in Afghanistan to keep the Taliban from entering the city.

(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin paid tribute on Thursday to Tsar Peter the Great on the 350th anniversary of his birth, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands. 
"Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. 
He did not take anything from them, he returned (what was Russia's)," Putin said after a visiting an exhibition dedicated to the tsar. 
 In televised comments on day 106 of his war in Ukraine, he compared Peter's campaign with the task facing Russia today.

Ukraine can receive Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers from Germany around June 22.

WNU editor: I do not think this June 22 delivery date was deliberately planned to coincide with the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Germany does not really have its act-together when it comes to supplying Ukraine with weapons .... Germany Never Gave Fixed Date on Weapons Delivery, Says Govt Spokesperson (Reuters). 
But June 22 is a day that is remembered by most Russians, and it is bringing back memories that are not pleasant. 
When I was a kid my father told me on a June 22 day why that date was important to him. The start of the war changed his life and the life of everyone he knew in 1941. I still remember the look that he had. It is the same look that my friends in New York City have when they remember 9/11.]]></summary>

RFE: Interview: Edward Luttwak, A Military Adviser To Presidents, Explains How The Ukraine War Began And How It Might End 
Edward Luttwak is among modern times' most sought-after military strategists, advising the Pentagon, presidents, and prime ministers around the world. He's also among their most controversial. Luttwak's analyses and conclusions are often described as being blunt, unequivocal, counterintuitive, and sometimes jarringly cynical. 
A polyglot American born to Jewish parents in World War II Romania and raised in Italy and England, he is the author of seminal books like Strategy: The Logic Of War And Peace and The Grand Strategy Of The Soviet Union as well as more than a dozen others. But he is best known for his 1968 book Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook, which is required reading at some war colleges.

WNU Editor: I have been following Edward Luttwack since the 1980s. His analysis is usually spot on. And while I do not think his confidence in Ukraine salvaging a "victory" in this war is realistic, the above interview is my must read post for today.]]></summary>

Washington Post: Biden says Zelensky 'didn't want to hear' U.S. warnings of invasion

The president spoke about the American commitment to supporting Ukraine four months into the invasion, saying, “Nothing like this has happened since World War II.”
