        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Turkey backs Sweden's Nato membership 
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to support Sweden's bid to join Nato, the military alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg says. 
He said the Turkish leader would forward Sweden's bid to parliament in Ankara and "ensure ratification". 
Meanwhile, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said: "I am very happy, it is a good day for Sweden." 
Turkey had previously spent months blocking Sweden's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. 
As one of Nato's 31 members, Turkey has a veto over any new country joining the group.

Defense News: White House wants Ukraine inspector general out of defense bill 
WASHINGTON ― The White House on Monday told lawmakers it opposes a provision in the House’s annual defense policy bill that would create a special inspector general for Ukraine aid, modelled after the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. 
The Ukraine inspector general was one of several provisions in the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act that the White House, in an Office of Management and Budget statement on the bill, told Congress it wants removed. 
The statement also objected to several provisions in the bill related to the U.S. nuclear arsenal and addresses the Pentagon cost assessment office drawn into a debate over Navy ship procurement. The House is expected to begin voting on the FY24 NDAA as early as Wednesday.

Zero Hedge: Kremlin: The US Just Confessed To Imminent War Crimes In Ukraine 
Statements made by National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on the Sunday news shows have been seized upon by the Kremlin as a clear demonstration the US has 'confessed to war crimes'. 
 Kirby in a fresh interview with ABC was defending President Biden's approving cluster bombs for Ukraine, which are banned by over 120 countries internationally for being 'indiscriminate' and thus more likely to result in civilian deaths. Kirby at one point told ABC that "we can all agree that more civilians have been and will continue to be killed by Russian forces… than will likely be hurt by the use of these cluster munitions."

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told DailyMail.com that Biden rightly acknowledged his administration has not adequately prepared the U.S. for major conflict.

Turkey's president has said his country will support Sweden's bid to join Nato if the European Union opens membership talks for his country. 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would state his demand at the Nato summit in Lithuania later this week.

He added that he had informed US President Joe Biden of his intentions. 
 Mr Erdogan's comments come ahead of a meeting with Sweden's prime minister and Nato's secretary general in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. 
Turkey is a Nato member and so has a veto over any new country joining the group.

The latest ratchet up has been the decision by the USA to supply the Ukrainian army with cluster bombs. These are nasty weapons which scatter and explode over a wide area. They are specifically designed to kill people rather that destroy infrastructure, military installations or communication hubs. They also have a sting in the tail – some of the bomblets remain unexploded, effectively becoming anti-personnel mines. These can turn wide swathes of territory into virtual no-go areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/07/10/34204">Read the full story, “The Ukraine War – Will it Ever End?”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>]]></summary>

The United Nations has warned that Sudan could be on the verge of all-out-war after a weekend airstrike killed dozens in a residential area in the Sudanese city of Omdurman. 
At least 22 people were killed and many injured in a shelling attack early Saturday, the country’s health ministry said, as months of infighting between Sudan’s rival military forces continue to rage on across the country. 
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the weekend bombing was an indication that Sudan was now on “the brink of a full-scale civil war.”

(Bloomberg) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will travel to Vilnius, Lithuania to meet NATO’s leaders at a summit of the military alliance his country is seeking to join. Zelenskiy will arrive Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Zelenskiy declined to comment. 
The gathering in Vilnius, less than 600 miles from Moscow, comes at a key moment, with Russia’s war in Ukraine nearing the 18-month mark. NATO aims to supply Kyiv with fresh munitions, including US-provided cluster bombs, and to assess the impact of the Wagner Group’s aborted mutiny last month on Russia’s leadership and operations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin met mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin after the failed Wagner group mutiny last month, the Kremlin says. 
Prigozhin, who heads the mercenary group, was among 35 Wagner commanders invited to the meeting in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added. 
He said that President Putin had given an "assessment" of the Ukraine war effort and the mutiny. 
The rebellion, launched on 23 June, lasted only 24 hours.

Under a deal to end the mutiny, which saw Wagner troops seize a city and march on Moscow, charges against Prigozhin were dropped and he was offered a move to Belarus.

WNU Editor: The meeting occurred 5 days after the rebellion. Prigozhin was there with about 35 Wagner commanders. All that I can say is that I wish I was a fly in that room.

QTR’s Fringe Finance: The Gold Standard Is Back: BRICS To Intro Gold-Backed Reserve Currency 
"...it could be, first and foremost, a major challenge to the US dollar's hegemony..." 
Remember back when the Russia/Ukraine war had just started, and I predicted that Russia and China would launch their own gold backed currency? 
At the time, this idea sounded completely foreign, and I was ridiculed for bringing it up. Today, it just become reality. 41+ countries look like they could be returning to a gold standard.

WNU Editor: 41 countries have already applied for BRICS-membership. I predict this announcement will result in even more countries joining. 
The US dollar will still be the world's reserve currency. But this BRICS announcement that they are going to introduce a new gold-backed reserve currency next month is just another sign on that the world is becoming multi-polar, and the dominant role of the U.S. in international affairs is coming to an end.]]></summary>

Red State: Yellen Commits Grave Error in Show of American Weakness in China 
Joe Biden and his team have been a mess when it comes to dealing with the Chinese. 
When the Chinese sent a spy balloon over our country, Biden waited until it flew across the whole country including sensitive military installations, and likely sent back information to China, before he got around to shooting it down. Then Biden reacted like it was on us to make up with the Chinese—when they were the ones who were spying on us. It’s the Chinese who owed us an explanation, not the other way around.

WNU Editor: In all of my years working with the Chinese, I never bowed to anyone. 
And as for US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen's trip to China. I also noticed no red carpet or welcoming ceremony for her when she arrived in Beijing. It looks like the US State Department's China desk is clueless on what it means to lose face and how to respond to it. 
 Update: US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen is not alone when it comes to US officials bowing to others (see tweet below).

This requirement serves as an effective deterrent, since it makes an attack on American missile fields a high-risk option. Unfortunately, the New START Treaty that bound Russia to limits on operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons faltered amidst serious tensions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent decision to suspend the treaty’s implementation.  We believe Russia’s continued observance of New START Treaty limits is increasingly unlikely.

While the 5th-generation fighter F-35 is now in bigger demand by the US Air Force and the American allies all over the world for its formidable combination of stealth, advanced sensors, and weapons systems, it seems to be increasingly difficult for its manufacturer Lockheed Martin to meet the demand with a cap of 156 aircraft produced for the year. 
The problem is further compounded by the growing supply chain hurdles, limited infrastructures at the production centers, and delayed engine-overhaul programs.

Reuters: North Korea warns it may shoot down US spy planes violating its airspace 
SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea accused the United States on Monday of violating its airspace by conducting surveillance flights and warned that, while Pyongyang was exercising restraint, such flights may be shot down. 
Provocative military actions by the United States were bringing the Korean peninsula closer to a nuclear conflict, said an unnamed spokesperson of North Korea's Ministry of National Defence in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. 
The report also cited the use of U.S. reconnaissance planes and drones and said Washington was escalating tensions by sending a nuclear submarine near the peninsula. 
"There is no guarantee that such a shocking accident as the downing of the U.S. Air Force strategic reconnaissance plane will not happen" in waters east of Korea, the spokesperson said.

A Dutch report says Iran continues to increase enriched uranium stocks 
A fresh batch of damning European intelligence reports reveal that the Islamic Republic of Iran sought to bypass U.S. and EU sanctions to secure technology for its nuclear weapons program with a view toward testing an atomic bomb. 
According to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), which first published translations of the intelligence documents on its website, the security agencies of Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany revealed sensitive data during the first six months of 2023 on the Iranian regime's illicit nuclear weapons proliferation activities. The reports mainly cover Iran’s alleged illegal conduct in 2022. 
The most shocking revelation in the trove of intelligence data was from the Netherlands General and Intelligence Security Service (AVID) that determined Iran’s astonishingly fast development of weapons-grade uranium "brings the option of a possible [Iranian] first nuclear test closer."

Newsweek: U.S. Airstrike Kills ISIS Leader in Syria: DOD 
The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) on Sunday confirmed that a drone airstrike from Friday successfully killed an ISIS leader in Syria. 
The official statement announcing the news was shared across various platforms, including CENTCOM's official Twitter account. 
In it, the agency confirmed the death of ISIS leader Usamah Al-Muhajir, with the airstrike taking place in an unspecified part of Eastern Syria.
"This will disrupt and degrade ISIS's ability to plan and conduct terror attacks," the official statement read. "However, CENTCOM's operations against ISIS, alongside partner forces in Iraq and Syria, will continue in order to achieve the group's enduring defeat."

UPI: Ukraine admits to Crimea bridge blast while Russia again shuts down traffic over 'cruise missile' 
July 9 (UPI) -- A Ukrainian official made the starkest admission yet that Ukraine targeted the Kerch Strait Bridge linking Crimea to Russia in October as Russian officials in the Ukrainian province said Sunday that air defenses had shot down a cruise missile near the bridge. 
Anna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, said in a statement on Telegram that it has been 273 days since Ukrainians "struck the first blow on the Crimean bridge in order to break the logistics of the Russians." 
Maliar made her remarks while celebrating other accomplishments of the Ukrainian military on the 500th day of the unprovoked war, including the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva and the liberation of Snake Island in the Black Sea -- which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Saturday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg:  Europe Can't Supply Ukraine With Weapons Fast Enough, Here's Why 
Defense contractors are under pressure to ramp up production but want long term government guarantees of sales 
(Bloomberg) — “Before, we had time, but no money,” said Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, head of BAE Systems Hägglunds AB, reflecting a common theme across Europe’s defense industry. “Today, we have money, but no time.” 
Almost 18 months into the war in Ukraine, Europe’s defense contractors — flooded with demand for everything from ammunition to shoulder-launched missiles and combat vehicles — face a dilemma. Do they gamble on expanding production, assuming that the war and tensions with Russia will last indefinitely? Or hold back until they get long-term commitments from governments that have spent the past few decades shaving or even slashing their defense budgets? 
 Read more ....

 
WNU Editor: It is going to cost tens of billions in Euros (if not more) to upgrade and expand Europe's military industrial base. No defense contractor or manufacturer is going to make that type of financial commitment knowing all too well that should the war end tomorrow, government's will immediately cut defense spending. 
And as for European governments willing to make that type of financial commitment? 
I hear a lot of talk, but I doubt that European governments are going to give defense firms long-term commitments.

European allies are split over when to offer Nato membership to Kyiv. The bigger question is: are they doing enough now to help Ukraine? 
The pressing question of Ukraine’s membership is expected to dominate this week’s pivotal summit of 31 Nato states in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital. Volodymyr Zelenskiy knows a gold-embossed official invite is unlikely to arrive while his country is still at war with Russia. But Ukraine’s leader is urging US president Joe Biden and alliance leaders to take immediate “concrete steps”, including security guarantees, a roadmap and timeline. Zelenskiy argues that would boost morale and send an implacable message to Vladimir Putin. 
Zelenskiy is right. Like Finland, Ukraine’s accession should be fast-tracked. Yet important though this issue is, Nato faces a far bigger question this week: whether it is doing enough to ensure Kyiv wins the war – or at least, doesn’t lose.

WNU Editor: I do not understand where the Guardian columnist Simon Tisdall or Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood above video) are coming from. At best the UK only has about 40 tanks and maybe, and it is a big maybe, be able to only assemble about 25,000 ground troops. On the opposite side Russia is keeping in reserve 500,000 soldiers in anticipation of a NATO response, on top of the 300,000+ soldiers fighting in Ukraine itself. 
I guess this talk about getting involved in Ukraine is all about pressuring the U.S. to deploy its forces .... Will American Troops Be Forced to Fight Russia in Ukraine's New NATO Deal? (Newsweek).]]></summary>

NATO will make an intermediate gesture to Kyiv at a summit this week. But the real test will be when the shooting stops and NATO must decide: Is Ukraine in or out? 
Vilnius is only the beginning. 
Ukraine wants NATO to give it a clear path to membership at this week’s summit in Lithuania. And the request is tying the group’s members in knots. 
Just wait until they have to make a real decision.

WNU Editor: Ukraine is not optimistic .... Ukraine pessimistic about joining Nato ahead of Vilnius summit (The Guardian). 
As to what is my take. 
When it comes down to it, if Ukraine is admitted into NATO in the current environment, it will be seen from the Kremlin as a declaration of war by NATO against Russia. That is why some US politicians are now stating the obvious .... McCaul warns admitting Ukraine to NATO immediately ‘would put us at war with Russia’ (The Hill). 
And as to the cost of such a war. It will be the most costly conflict in human history by far, and fortunately most NATO leaders are aware of that.

The event is expected to draw leading scientists, researchers and industry experts from around the world, providing a platform to promote collaborations and for the exchange of knowledge and ideas.  Hong Kong has a unique opportunity to leverage its strengths in R&D capabilities, technology infrastructure, legal system and intellectual property, thanks to the national 14th Five-Year Plan and the Greater Bay Area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When US superstar Taylor Swift announced yet more dates for her much-hyped world tour -- but once again skipped Canada -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could not shake it off.
In a tweet referencing the lyrics of Swift's songs, Trudeau urged her to fill the blank space and perform in America's neighbor to the north.
"It's me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you," Trudeau said in a message on Twitter Wednesday evening that quickly went viral. "So, don't make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon."
The artist had just announced the addition of new dates to her consistently sold-out Eras Tour, which began in March in Arizona.
She plans more than 100 concerts through the summer of 2024 -- in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia, but none in Canada.
The bad blood risks turning Swift into something of an anti-hero in famously nice Canada. Last month, a conservative lawmaker lamented what he called the singer's lack of respect for his country and similarly implored her to save some dates for Canada.
Swift last came to Canada in 2018.]]></summary>

According to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index, the world's richest people added an average of $14 million per day to their wealth over the past six months, "the best half-year for billionaires since the back half of 2020, when the economy rebounded from a Covid-induced slump."
Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk saw the largest net worth boost of any global billionaire, adding nearly $97 billion in the first half of the year. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, saw his wealth grow by close to $59 billion, the second-largest gain of any billionaire.

The app went live on Apple and Android app stores in 100 countries at 2300 GMT on Wednesday, and will run with no ads for now, but its release in Europe has been delayed over data privacy concerns.
Threads is the biggest challenger yet to Elon Musk-owned Twitter, which has seen a series of potential competitors emerge but not yet replace one of the world's biggest social media platforms, despite its struggles.
"10 million sign ups in seven hours," Zuckerberg wrote on his official Threads account Thursday.

Fifteen women died, two of them while receiving hospital care, as well as 13 men and a child, the prosecutor said.

Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, took control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on June 24, seized the command centre there where Russia coordinates its war in Ukraine, and sent a column of fighters towards Moscow before standing down after striking a deal with the Kremlin.
His mutiny posed the biggest threat to President Vladimir Putin since the Russian leader came to power more than two decades ago and has forced the Kremlin to move into a damage-limitation exercise in which it has stressed the loyalty of the armed forces and the unit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey said the Hollywood actor grabbed him "like a cobra", a London court heard on Wednesday.
The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is the third of four men accusing Spacey of a string of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
The accuser said he met the US actor, who won Oscars for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", at an event in a West End theatre in 2005.
In a recording of a police interview played at Southwark Crown Court in south London, the man said Spacey "smelled of booze" and "looked disheveled" when he arrived.
"My first impression is that he seemed very arrogant," he added.
"I remember he looked me up and down and looked at my crotch region," the accuser said, adding that the actor made crude remarks towards him.
"It was very aggressive. I have never had anyone talk to me in that way. It was all getting hardcore," he said about the alleged comments.
The complainant said Spacey allegedly grabbed him "with such force it was really painful", describing it as "like a cobra coming out and getting hold".
"I remember freezing and pushing his arm away and feeling shellshocked and frustrated that anybody would be that sleazy," he added.
The accuser said he had initially put the incident "in a box" but it had "a detrimental effect" on his life.
The alleged victim criticized Spacey for coming out as gay several years ago when other allegations against him became public.
"He took no responsibility for it, he just said 'I'm gay'.
"He's still not hearing what he did was wrong –- that's sort of spurred me on a bit," the witness said.
The court has heard from two other complainants, one of whom said Spacey was an aggressive "predator" uncomfortable with his sexuality.
Another accuser alleged Spacey kissed his neck and grabbed his crotch.
The prosecution has described Spacey as a "sexual bully", whose preferred method of assault was grabbing other men in the crotch.
Spacey denies all the charges.]]></summary>

At 90, Nokkho Konyak can barely see beyond a few feet, his facial tattoos marking him as a warrior are fading and his frail body needs support.
But his eyes light up and his hands become animated when he talks about "those simpler times".
"We witnessed our brave elders cutting off enemies' heads and participated in many battles," he told AFP.
Nokkho is a Konyak, a small but fierce and respected warrior community in northeastern India's Nagaland state.
The Konyaks were the last to give up the age-old practice of severing enemies' heads in this remote, hilly and densely forested region close t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending years at home bringing up her two children, electrical systems technician Sarah Sklenicka found it a "big challenge" to get back into the job market.
But now the 37-year-old is ready to take on anything thanks to an experimental Austrian scheme, which claims to be a world first in tackling long-term unemployment.
The village of Gramatneusiedl near Vienna now has a zero jobless rate after guaranteeing work to all its 129 long-term unemployed.
The project shows it is possible to eradicate this stubbornly difficult problem at a community level, said economist Oliver Picek of Vienna's Momentum Institute.
"It is possible to give a job to everyone who needs one," he told AFP.

The planned, decades-long discharge of accumulated water from the devastated nuclear facility has been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as meeting global standards.
Its chief Rafael Grossi acknowledged at a meeting in Iwaki, Fukushima prefecture, that concerns remain.
"All these complex graphs and statistics are one thing but the reality, the reality of people, the reality of the economy, the reality of the social mood and perceptions may be different," he told a meeting of residents and officials.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
