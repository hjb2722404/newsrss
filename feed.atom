        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Republican Senator Tim Scott has stated United States President Joe Biden has “blood on his hands” after Hamas’ attack on Israel, says Curtin University Dean of Global Future Joe Siracusa. 

Mr Siracusa says the conflict between Palestine and Israel began “in earnest” after Biden’s administration “turned over $6 billion for the hostages to Iran”.

“Of course, Iran is behind this,” Mr Siracusa told Sky News Australia. 

“When the history books are written, those will be the opening.”

Officials say 4,741 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the conflict as Israel’s military claims the number of people held hostage has risen to 212.]]></summary>

The Agriculture Minister says since the beginning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Labor government have “condemned Hamas’ attack on innocent Israeli lives”.

“We’ve said consistently that Israel has a right to defend itself,” Mr Watt told Sky News Australia. 

“But that doesn’t get away from the fact that every life in this conflict is worth something.

“We don’t want to see any more lives lost than absolutely needed.”]]></summary>

Several have signed a loyalty pledge to support the winner of the first vote, aiming to avoid the vote-counting confusion that followed Mr Jordan’s candidacy. 

This comes after earlier this month, former US House speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted. 

“If we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern, and every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” Republican Representative Michael McCaul said. 

A secret vote with the GOP conference is scheduled for Tuesday as Republicans are encouraged to sign a unity pledge, promising to support whoever wins the vote.]]></summary>

The decision to remove the sanctions clears the way for the Prime Minister to visit Beijing next month.

Mr Tyrrell said Chinese wine consumption has dropped by about 60 per cent because “they can’t get the wine that they really like to drink”.

“As more and more Chinese people have travelled over the last 10 years, they’ve got to know Australia, they like Australia, they like Australians and got a great taste for Australian wine, so we really need to be back in that market,” he told Sky News Australia.

Mr Tyrrell hopes China’s economy will grow and Australian wine sales will grow with it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A secret recording revealed by "60 Minutes Australia" exposed a conversation former President Donald Trump had with billionaire Anthony Pratt while he was in office, The New York Times reported. 
Pratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. 
Among the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a "favor" for him.

Trump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do," admitting not only to the bribery but also that it's frequent behavior for him. 

"It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings," The Times reported. 
Another thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. 
Senate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists at the University of Bristol have used supercomputer climate models to predict the formation of a future supercontinent called Pangea Ultima, which is expected to occur 250 million years from now. This continent will bring extreme temperatures, rendering it uninhabitable for mammals. The study attributes the dramatic increase in temperatures to heightened volcanism and the sun emitting more energy and heat as it ages. The research provides insights into how Earth's climate might change in the distant future due to natural processes. Despite concerns about contemporary climate change, the Earth is expected to remain habitable until the emergence of Pangea Ultima.]]></summary>

POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?be allowed to run for office?


	The candidate pointed to the Biden administration's decision to release $6 billion in Iranian funds.


	But Scott also acknowledged that Iran never received any of the money because the Biden administration froze it.


	"And to say that Joe Biden is complicit, which you also said, in the greatest, deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I mean, that's beyond the pale, isn't it?" the ABC host asked.


	"There's no doubt that when you have President Biden negotiating with the Iranians for the release of hostages, I said this under President Obama as well, when we paid 400 million dollars for hostages, you were creating a market for American lives to be lost," Scott opined.

* 32% have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in media’s news reporting 


* New high of 39% have no confidence at all, compared with 27% in 2016 


* Democrats’ trust is down 12 points since last year; lowest since 2016 


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The 32% of Americans who say they trust the mass media “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to report the news in a full, fair and accurate way ties Gallup’s lowest historical reading, previously recorded in 2016. Although trust in media currently matches the historical low, it was statistically similar in 2021 (36%) and 2022 (34%). 


Another 29% of U.S. adults have “not very much” trust, while a record-high 39% register “none at all.” This nearly four in 10 Americans who completely lack confidence in the media is the highest on record by one percentage point. It is 12 points higher than the 2016 reading, which came amid sharp criticism of the media from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump -- making the current assessment of the media the grimmest in Gallup’s history. In 2016, U.S. adults were most likely to say they had “not very much” trust (41%).

* No consensus at the Cairo Summit on the Israel-Palestinian violence. 
* The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened Saturday, allowing the transportation of humanitarian aid. 
* Clashes between Israel and Hamas continue, with Israeli airstrikes killing 19 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian media. 
* Israel issued a warning advising its citizens against traveling to Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, and if they are in those countries to leave as soon as possible. 
A Cairo summit hosted by Egypt Saturday failed to reach an agreement on how to contain the violence between Israel and Hamas. 
Arab leaders condemned the Israeli bombardment of Gaza while mostly Western countries said civilians should be shielded, but with Israel and senior U.S. officials absent there was no consensus on how to resolve the conflict.

The Israeli military on Saturday stepped up warnings to Gazan residents and continued preparations for an offensive in the war-torn territory, including for ground operations, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. 
The IDF again instructed the roughly 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza to evacuate, threatening that “no matter where you are,” there will be “significant combat.” 
Residents in Gaza reported that Israeli planes rained red leaflets on neighborhoods Saturday, urging residents to evacuate. Those with cell phones also received the message digitally, according to social media reports.

The Guardian: Chinese ship is focus of investigation into damaged pipeline, Finland says

 
Police focusing on Newnew Polar Bear cargo ship that was in the area when gas pipeline was damaged 
Finnish police have said a Chinese ship whose movement coincided with the time and place of the suspected sabotage of a pipeline between Finland and Estonia that was damaged this month is now the focus of their investigation. 
After a leak led to the shutdown of the Balticconnector pipeline on 8 October, Finnish authorities have been investigating the damage they say was caused by “external” activity. 
On Friday, they said their focus was on the Newnew Polar Bear, a cargo ship that reportedly came under Chinese ownership this year. Between 2017 and 2022 it was known as the Baltic Fulmar, the Finnish broadcaster YLE reported.

The president’s second ever Oval Office address was sober and occasionally dark.It challenged America to stick with some major fights. 
President Joe Biden used a rare Oval Office address Thursday night to forcefully advocate for aiding both Israel and Ukraine. 
And he laid out a dark vision of what would happen should that aid, along with America’s larger commitment to defending democracy, not be delivered.

Argentina votes on Sunday in one of the most open presidential elections for decades. 
The effects of a deep economic crisis have proved fertile ground for an unorthodox far-right front-runner, with wild hair, big sideburns and a totally radical approach to ruling the country. 
Javier Milei was, until recently, a relative unknown. An economist, pundit and rock fan, he came top in recent primaries and polls now put him ahead in Sunday's first round.
He is very clear about wanting to shake things up. At one campaign event, he wielded a chainsaw to send a message that he intends to slash spending to improve Argentina's economy.

China has developed an arsenal of more than 500 operational nuclear warheads and is set to double that number by the end of the decade, exceeding previous Pentagon estimates, according to a Defense Department report. 
The figures, released in an unclassified public report to Congress on Thursday, are part of a broad assessment of China’s military goals and developments in the past year, and highlight the rapid advances in Beijing’s multi-decade plan to build a nuclear weapons arsenal that rivals that of the United States.

Worldcon -- the world's oldest and most influential sci-fi gathering -- is taking place in China for the first time, drawing hordes of eager local fans of all genders.
China can still be a relatively socially conservative country, and under President Xi Jinping the space for the expression of feminism has shrunk even further over the last decade.
But in science fiction, the number of women authors has rocketed in recent years, said Regina Kanyu Wang, a writer and editor nominated for two prestigious Hugo Awards at Worldcon this year.

Founded by four friends in a pub in 2018, the collective's campaigns and stunts skewering politicians and spotlighting issues get millions of views online -- and often generate mainstream media coverage.
They remain best known for their light-hearted early efforts, like plastering ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's optimistic tweets about the joys of life after Brexit to contrast them with the reality.
More recent ploys, involving stings by fake companies and covert filming, have had a more serious undertone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of China's biggest beer makers said it had opened an investigation after a video appearing to show a factory employee urinating on raw ingredients went viral this week.
The clip, published online on Thursday, purportedly shows a male worker at a Tsingtao Brewery Co. warehouse clambering into a high-walled container and relieving himself onto its contents.
The footage circulated widely on Chinese social media, racking up tens of millions of views on the popular platform Weibo.
Tsingtao said on Friday that it had contacted the police over the incident and an investigation was ongoing.
"Our company attaches high importance to the relevant video that emerged from Tsingtao Brewery No. 3 on October 19," the beermaker said in a statement.
"We reported the incident to the police at the earliest opportunity, and public security organs are involved in the investigation," it added.
"At present, the batch of malt in question has been completely sealed. The company continues to strengthen its management procedures and ensure product quality."
Many social media users reacted to the video with anger and voiced support for one of China's best-known beverage brands.
"I suggest the company takes this man to court and gets him to pay compensation for the damages," read one popular Weibo response to the company's statement.
"Investigate this thoroughly! Always stand up for our national champion brands!" wrote another user.
Hong Kong-listed Tsingtao is China's second-largest brewer, and its tall bottles of crisp lager are perennial fridge-fillers in bars across East Asia.
In recent years, the company has sought to capitalise on the changing tastes of younger Chinese drinkers by diversifying into craft ales and other products.
Some web users were not about to pass up the chance to make a wry quip about the country's famously light and fizzy mass-market brews.
"I've always said the beer here is like horse pee. Turns out I was wrong," one of them commented.
"Thanks, I think I'll have wine instead," quipped another.]]></summary>

As the terms “genocide”, “war crimes” and “crimes against humanity” are used to describe the deadly acts carried out by both sides, FRANCE 24 takes a look at what these terms mean.
It has been more than two weeks since the war between Hamas and Israel started, and the fog of war is showing no signs of thinning.
Since the fighting began on October 7, more than 1,400 Israelis and 4,000 Palestinians have been killed. Almost half of Gaza’s population has been displaced, according to the UN, and more than 200 people are still being held hostage by Hamas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, former Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI) posted to social media that members of his family had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.
"I was really worried about this," wrote Amash, the first Palestinian-American to represent Michigan in Congress. "With great sadness, I have now confirmed that several of my relatives (including Viola and Yara pictured here) were killed at Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church in Gaza, where they had been sheltering, when part of the complex was destroyed as the result of an Israeli airstrike."
"Give rest, O Lord, to their souls, and may their memories be eternal," Amash wrote in mourning.
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
"The Palestinian Christian community has endured so much," Amash continued. "Our family is hurting badly. May God watch over all Christians in Gaza — and all Israelis and Palestinians who are suffering, whatever their religion or creed."
Tensions have flared in the region after a devastating terrorist attack by Hamas that left hundreds dead and hundreds more as hostages in Gaza.
Israel has responded with a series of airstrikes, as well as a blockade on Gaza that has limited humanitarian aid and electricity, although they rolled back an order limiting the provision of water into the territory.]]></summary>

Astronomers Spot Most Distant Fast Radio Burst Ever Detected

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Relief Web: Israel destroys a quarter of northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian death toll exceeds 4,000 
Geneva – Israel is conducting the largest campaign of destruction of buildings and residential houses in the Gaza Strip in modern history, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor stated, as part of a wide-scale military attack ongoing since the seventh of this month. 
Euro-Med Monitor emphasised that Israel is focusing its attacks on the Gaza and North Gaza governorates through a systematic destruction campaign, aiming to force displacement and population transfer against the residents of these governorates. 
The Israeli army has warned the residents of both governorates, which are home to nearly a million people, to evacuate the areas and move to the central and southern sections of the Strip, a measure that raises serious legal and humanitarian concerns as it endangers the safety of civilians.

Update #1: Gaza war death toll rises to 4,137 (Economic Times)
 
Update #2: UN says 4,200 people killed in Israel, Gaza conflict in 10 days (Anadolu Agency)

 
WNU Editor: The numbers are horrifying. As of yesterday (link here), just in Gaza alone 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since Oct.7. Of this 3,785 total, 1,524 were children and 1,000 were women. 

 
Update #3: These shortages have the potential to be just as destructive as bombs if not alleviated soon .... Gaza conditions worsen amid warnings that shortages could ‘kill many, many people’ (CNN).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced on Friday she was separating from her partner, with whom she has a daughter, after he was recorded making sleazy comments.
The announcement came after Andrea Giambruno, a television presenter, was caught making overtly sexual and sexist comments to female colleagues off-air.
"My relationship with Andrea Giambruno, which lasted almost 10 years, ends here," Meloni wrote on social media, saying their paths had "diverged for some time".
"How do you do, darling?" Giambruno is heard telling a female colleague on the sidelines of his talk show on the Rete 4 channel, owned by Mediaset.
"Do you know that (name redacted) and I are having an affair? All of Mediaset knows it and now you do too," he tells the woman, who is also off camera

The State Department on Thursday urged Americans to make plans to leave Lebanon “as soon as possible,” elevating an earlier security warning that advised Americans not to travel to the country. 
“The U.S. Embassy is closely monitoring the security situation in Lebanon,” the Thursday advisory read. 
“The Department of State urges U.S. citizens in Lebanon to make plans to depart as soon as possible while commercial options are still available.”

Update #1: US, UK call on their citizens to leave Lebanon while flights 'remain available' (Times of Israel)
 
Update #2: US embassy urges its citizens in Lebanon to leave 'ASAP' (Jerusalem Post)

 
WNU Editor: The US is not the only one telling its citizens to leave .... US, UK, Germany tell citizens to leave Lebanon as regional tensions rise (Al Jazeera). More here .... Canada now advising against all travel to Lebanon amid Israel-Hamas conflict (Global Times), here .... Oman urges its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately (Al Arabiya), and here .... Saudi Urges Citizens To Depart Lebanon 'Immediately' (AFP).
This push to get foreigners out of Lebanon tells me the following. Israel is going to launch an offensive on northern Gaza in the coming days/weeks. This offensive will probably result in a reaction from Hezbollah, and the real possibility of a second front in this war along the Lebanese border.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satellite photos analyzed Friday by The Associated Press show a long convoy of trucks filled with humanitarian aid waiting to cross the border from Egypt to the Gaza Strip. 

More than 200 trucks carrying roughly 3,000 tons of aid were positioned near the crossing, according to aid officials. The provisions are intended to bring some relief to the Palestinians in Gaza, which is being blockaded by Israel in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on towns in southern Israel. 

Many in Gaza, reduced to eating one meal a day and without enough water to drink, are waiting desperately for the aid. It was unclear whether fuel would be allowed across to power hospital generators. 

On Friday, workers began repairing damaged to the crossing caused by Israeli bombings. Officials hoped to open the crossing on Saturday.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
