Treatment of prisoners and POWs are a growing concern in the Russia - Ukraine conflict.

Families in Padangbai are sending off 117 deceased. They were previously buried in a public cemetery, not far from the cremation site. 

Cremation is usually held by individual families, but the mass ceremony eases the burden of cost. Some families waited for more than five years for the cremation. 

The Hindu rites on Friday started in the morning as the residents paraded bade, a 6-meter (20-foot) wooden tower carrying bodies and a coffin in the shape of Gajah Mina, an elephant-headed fish, to the sea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a late-night televised address, Zelenskiy also said the hundreds of thousands of people still in combat zones in the larger Donbas region needed to leave.
	

		"The more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill," he said, adding that residents would be given compensation.
	

		Separately, domestic Ukrainian media outlets quoted Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk as saying the evacuation needed to take place before winter begins since the region's natural gas supplies had been destroyed.
	

		Zelenskiy said hundreds of thousands of people were still living in areas of Donbas where fighting was fierce.
	

		"Many refuse to leave, but it still needs to be done," he said. "If you have the opportunity, please talk to those who still remain in the combat zones in Donbas. Please convince them that it is necessary to leave."

The day before they left, two of the deceased, Robbie Phillips, 65, a travel consultant who was actually one of Sandals’ top salespeople, and her husband, Michael, 68, checked themselves into a medical facility complaining of nausea and vomiting, according to local authorities.  Donnis Chiarella, 65, who was staying on the other side of the wall, also visited a clinic, his son told ABC News.  All returned to their adjacent beachfront villas, where the Phillips and Ms Chiarella’s husband Vincent, 64, were found unresponsive the next morning according to local authorities.  Later that day, all three were pronounced dead.  Ms. Chiarella, who had to be hospitalized, was the only survivor.

"I don't think I can go at the same pace as I used to travel," said the 85-year-old pope, who suffers pain in his knee that has seen him increasingly reliant on a wheelchair.
"I think that at my age and with this limitation, I have to save myself a little bit to be able to serve the Church. Or, alternatively, to think about the possibility of stepping aside."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BEIJING (Reuters) - A prominent Chinese commentator said on Saturday he deleted a tweet warning of military retaliation should U.S. fighter jets escort House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on any visit to Taiwan, after Twitter blocked his account.
Pelosi, number three in the U.S. line of presidential succession, after Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, signalled on Friday she was embarking on a trip to Asia.
She did not mention Taiwan, but speculation of her visiting the democratically ruled island, claimed by Beijing, has intensified in recent days, fuelling tensions beyond the Taiwan Strait.
Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Biden in a phone call on Thursday that Washington should abide by the one-China principle and "those who play with fire will perish by it."

The declaration came a day after Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of bombing a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russian-held territory, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying more than 50 were killed and calling the attack a war crime.
"Today, Gazprom suspended its gas supplies to Latvia... due to violations of the conditions" of purchase, the company said on Telegram.
Gazprom drastically cut gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline on Wednesday to about 20 percent of its capacity.

David Diaz of the Spanish oceanographic institute told Le Monde such ocean heatwaves were "the equivalent of underwater wildfires, with fauna and flora dying just as if they had been burned."
The region has suffered an extreme heatwave this month, producing record air temperatures and low winds, causing a significantly hotter and deeper layer of ocean surface water.
As Reuters reported, "The warmer air along with shifting ocean currents and a stable sea surface have warmed coastal Mediterranean waters several degrees Celsius beyond the average temperature of 24°C to 26°C for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Saturday outlined a draft referendum question in a bid to change the constitution to set up a representative Indigenous body in parliament.
Australia's constitution currently does not recognize Indigenous peoples, and the move to enshrine a so-called "voice" -- a consultative body to supply advice to the government on decisions that would impact the marginalized group -- in the document would require a nationwide referendum.
Speaking at an Indigenous festival in Arnhem Land -- home to a majority Indigenous population -- centre-left leader Albanese proposed a draft referendum question to the Australian public: "Do you support an alteration to the Constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice?"
Albanese -- elected in May -- had promised a referendum vote to be held before the end of his term in 2025.
It remains unclear how the referendum will take shape but proposing the draft question to Aboriginal Australian leaders and the public would be a first step.
He also on Saturday recommitted to the "Uluru Statement from the Heart", which called for improved rights and constitutional recognition for Australia's First Nations people.
The 2017 statement was rejected by then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's conservative government.
But Albanese said the Uluru statement is "about consulting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on the decisions that affect you, nothing more, but nothing less".
"This is simple courtesy. It is common decency," he added.
"It recognizes the centuries of failure... the failure to ask the most basic human question: how would I feel if this were done to me?"
Australia has long failed to close the gap between the health and wellbeing of its First Nations people and the rest of the population, with soaring incarceration rates among Indigenous peoples and a life expectancy about eight years lower than the national average.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[President Joe Biden's administration tried Friday to defuse heated Chinese warnings against a possible trip to Taiwan by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as Beijing announced live-fire military drills in the Taiwan Strait.
Pelosi is reportedly about to leave on an Asian tour that would include Taiwan -- although she pointedly refused to confirm Friday that she would visit the self-ruled island citing travel security considerations.
China sees any such stop by the speaker as a provocation, upsetting the tense status quo under which Washington formally recognizes China's sovereignty claim over the island -- while backing the democratic Taiwanese government.

The NFL?
Congress?
The fanbase of the dreary team he’s owned since 1999, now known as the Washington Commanders, which has long been the league’s Animal House?
By Thursday, Snyder had done everything he could to arm the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which has been investigating his team for nearly a year.  Instead of appearing before the committee, he dragged, challenged and asked his legal team to withdraw all delaying orders.  He declined to attend the June hearing where the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sat down and faced the committee grills.
Then, dodging the subpoena, he sailed off into the sunset, out of the country, away from the prying eyes of Congress.


Finally, on Thursday, he gave in – but only halfway.  Snyder…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ZURICH (Reuters) - Austrian leaders appealed for national unity after a doctor who faced death threats from anti-vaccination activists and coronavirus pandemic conspiracy theorists took her own life.
"Let's put an end to this intimidation and fear mongering. Hate and intolerance have no place in our Austria," President Alexander Van der Bellen said, hailing Lisa-Maria Kellermayr as a doctor who stood for healing people, protecting them from disease and taking a cautious approach to the pandemic.
"But some people have been enraged by this. And these people scared her, threatened her, first on the internet and then also in person, directly in her practice."
The body of the doctor -- who had often given media interviews about fighting the coronavirus pandemic and promoting vaccinations -- was found in her office in Upper Austria on Friday.
Media cited prosecutors as saying they had found a suicide note and were not planning an autopsy.
Austria last month dropped plans to introduce compulsory COVID-19 vaccination for adults, saying it was unlikely that the measure would raise one of western Europe's lowest vaccination rates.
Tens of thousands of people had marched in regular protests against lockdowns last year and plans to make vaccinations mandatory, highlighting a social divide over public health measures that many countries have experienced.
But the doctor's death -- which the Austrian physicians' association said reflected a broader trend of threats against medical staff -- shocked the country.
"Hatred against people is inexcusable. This hatred must finally stop," Health Minister Johannes Rauch said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Maher Nazih
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Shi'ite populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr stormed Baghdad's fortified government zone on Saturday for the second time in a week, escalating a political stand-off that is hitting ordinary Iraqis hardest.
Protesters rallied by Sadr and his social-political Sadrist Movement tore down concrete barriers and entered the Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions, heading for Iraq's parliament, a Reuters witness said.
The scenes followed similar protests on Wednesday, although this time several protesters and police officers were hurt as Sadr's supporters threw stones and police fired teargas and stun grenades, according to security officials and medics.
Sadr's party came first in a general election in October but he withdrew his lawmakers from parliament when he failed to form a government which excluded his Shi'ite rivals, mostly groups backed by Iran.
Sadr has since made good on threats to stir up popular unrest if parliament tries to approve a government he does not like, saying it must be free of foreign influence and the corruption that has plagued Iraq for decades.
The Sadrists chanted against Sadr's political rivals who are now trying to form a government. Iraq has been without a president and prime minister for a record period because of the deadlock.
Sadr maintains large state power himself because his movement remains involved in running the country - his loyalists sit in powerful positions throughout Iraqi ministries and state bodies.
Iraqis linked neither to Sadr nor to his opponents say they are caught in the middle of the political gridlock.
While Baghdad earns record income from its vast oil wealth, the country has no budget, regular power and water cuts, poor education and healthcare, and insufficient job opportunities for the young.

					Dekha Dewandana ran a thriving ‘homestay’ tourism property in Bali, and received UN-supported training which has helped him to maintain a high standard of hospitality.

The High Court on Friday ended the long-running legal wrangle by ruling against plaintiff Rebekah Vardy, saying she had not been defamed by her former friend Coleen Rooney.
In the verdict, Judge Karen Steyn ruled that the reputational damage suffered by Ms Vardy lacked what she described as “the sting of defamation”.  For that reason, she said in a written decision released Friday, “the matter is closed.”


The judge also reprimanded Ms Vardy, who sued Ms Rooney in June 2020, writing that she had regularly leaked information about her former friend to the press, adding that “significant parts of her evidenc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since “Lemonade” (2016), her last solo studio album and accompanying film, Beyoncé has overwhelmed fans with a number of ambitious in-between projects.
In 2018, she performed as one of the headliners of the Coachella festival, where her show honored the tradition of historically black college and university marching bands, and was widely hailed as a triumph — one that “redirected its music, discarding its ties to pop and framing it squarely in a line of Southern black musical traditions,” as New York Times critic Jon Caramanica wrote.  The performance was later made into a Netflix special and an album, both titled “Homecoming.”
Also in 2018, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, her husband, released a joint album, “All is love” credited to the Carters.  And in June 2020, at the height of nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd, she released a song, “Black Parade”, with lines like “Put your fist up, show black love.”
“Black Parade” won the Grammy Award the following year for Best R&B Performance, one of four prizes that night it took Beyoncé’s career to 28 – more than any other woman.  This year, Beyoncé was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song for “Be Alive,” from the movie “King Richard,” a biopic about Venus and Serena Williams’ father.
How the early leak will affect the commercial prospects of “Renaissance” remains unclear.  Years ago, the unauthorized release of music in advance could have devastating consequences for an album.  But that danger has been mitigated by the move to streaming.
And Beyoncé, like most other artists today, has taken advance orders for physical copies of her album, which will count on the charts as soon as they ship — usually the week of release.  On Beyoncé’s site, all four boxes of “Renaissance” and its limited-edition vinyl version are sold out.

“What do you think of when you think of swimming?”  I recently posed this question to a class of high school students, and although their answers varied widely – “fun”, “a little scary”, “family”, “summer” – one answer led the pack: “ freedom”.  I love that our human relationship with water sparks conversations about so much more.

They had just come from three weeks off and were back in company class, preparing for a tour of upstate New York.  Some carried energy drinks and bottles of hand sanitizer;  others brought their dogs, who sat under the barre as the dancers began a series of exercises – bends, stretches, jumps and pirouettes.
Tall and majestic, Chun Wai Chan stood near the center of the studio.  In May, he became the first Chinese-born principal dancer in City Ballet’s 74-year history, only the fourth Asian to hold the rank.

According to some analysts, by removing the additional issuance of ETH used to finance the energy cost required on traditional mining consensus, Ether could finally achieve “ultra-sound currency” status.

On Beacon Chain, the issuance will be around 1,600 ETH per day, which will significantly reduce inflation by 13,000 ETH per day on PoW. 
The merger sets the effects on the monetary policies of Ethereum to become ultrasonic money.
