Times of Israel: Far from Gaza hardships, Hamas chief and family enjoy easy life in Qatar

 
Thanks to Doha’s sponsorship and the wealth he accumulated as Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh and his children today live a life of wealth and privileges denied to other Gazans 
Shortly after the start of Hamas’s brutal attack against Israel on October 7, a video began circulating of the terror group’s leader Ismail Haniyeh in his elegant office in the Qatari capital Doha, watching the bloody onslaught unfold on Al Jazeera and “prostrating in gratitude” with a group of other Hamas officials for the killing of over 1,300 Israelis, among them at least 1,000 civilians.
For years, Haniyeh has been rebuked by many Palestinians for leading a comfortable life away from the hardships of Gaza in the oil-rich Gulf monarchy, which offers shelter to the terror group’s leaders and an internationally recognized platform to spread its propaganda through Al Jazeera.

The Federalist: No Mitch McConnell, Ukraine Aid Is Not ‘Rebuilding Our Industrial Base’ 
Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to reassure Ukrainian aid skeptics that billions in foreign assistance is being spent on American manufacturers to build weapons at home. 
“If you look at the Ukraine assistance,” McConnell said on CBS, “a significant portion of what’s being spent in the United States and 38 different states, replacing the weapons that we send to Ukraine with more modern weapons, so we’re rebuilding our industrial base.” 
But a closer examination of the aid for Ukraine reveals an overwhelming majority of taxpayer dollars are going overseas. Just a fraction of the $113 billion spent has gone to “rebuilding our industrial base.”

Antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents have surged in Britain since a deadly rampage by Hamas gunmen in Israel on Oct. 7 sparked retaliatory attacks on Gaza. Massive pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been held in London and other major UK cities, while Jewish groups have held vigils for hostages who were taken by the militants.

CNN: Tuberville says he will keep blocking military promotions despite Israel’s war  
Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who has held up military promotions for nine months, slammed a proposal being floated to change the chamber’s rules to allow a vote on many of the nominations en masse and attacked the White House and Senate Democrats for not negotiating with him. 
“It’s typical of this place. This administration would rather burn the Senate down and that’s what would happen. … If you change the rules of the Senate then it lasts forever,” Tuberville told CNN’s Manu Raju. “So they would rather burn down the Senate than negotiate.”

The aircraft flew only with its primer paint and a small serial number (20-0003) on its twin tails, and will receive its final colors and insignias before the delivery to the U.S. Air Force.

RT:  Multiple US bases attacked with missiles and drones – media

 
Militias in Iraq and Syria have defied American warnings and vowed to keep up the strikes 
 Iran-backed militias have attacked four US bases in Iraq and Syria in a 24-hour period, Al-Mayadeen news reported on Sunday. The attacks came after US forces launched airstrikes against Iranian targets in both countries. 
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced on Sunday that it had targeted the al-Shaddadi base in eastern Syria on Saturday with two drones, and launched rockets at another American base in the al-Omar oil field near Deir ez-Zor, Lebanon-based news channel Al-Mayadeen reported.

 The Center Square:  Illegal border crossers total over 10 million since Biden inauguration

 
Total is greater than the individual populations of 41 states  
More than 10 million people have been reported illegally entering the United States since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the greatest number in history and of any administration. 
They total more than the individual populations of 41 states. 
The number of people illegally entering the country surged after Biden and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas halted many preexisting border security policies, advanced sweeping parole and other policies to release the greatest number of illegal foreign nationals into the country, encouraged people from all over the world to use a phone app to enter the U.S., and facilitated U.S. entry application processes in foreign countries, among others.

Israel has urged Russia to protect "all its citizens and all Jews" after a large mob stormed a Dagestan airport, some shouting antisemitic slogans. 
Video footage apparently from the scene shows an angry crowd running in the airport in Makhachkala, reportedly seeking people arriving from Tel Aviv. 
Some of the crowd ran onto the runway and surrounded aircraft there. 
Russia's aviation agency said the situation was under control after authorities had arrived on the scene.

	Tapper said Greene's censure resolution read like she "learned about the Arab-Israeli conflict maybe ten minutes before."


	"This is not an insurrection," he insisted. "Antisemitism is not a cudgel to be used against people for political points. Nor is Islamophobia or racism or anti-gay behavior or misogyny or any other kind of bigotry."

Thousands of people storm food warehouses in Gaza to take flour and basic needs in a mark of growing desperation. 
The United Nations relief agency says thousands of Palestinians, desperate due to three weeks of total siege and bombing, broke into several of its warehouses in the Gaza Strip, taking wheat, flour and other basic goods. 
“This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege,” said Thomas White, director of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CBS host Margaret Brennan grilled Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) on Sunday after he said he opposed aid to children in Gaza because he insisted it would go to the terror group Hamas. 
While Vance agreed that there are "a lot of innocent people in Gaza," he insisted that terrorists would intercept the aid packages.
"So if you deliver a large amount of humanitarian assistance, who's it going to go to?" he asked. "The children in Gaza or to the Hamas fighters on the front line? I fear it's going to go to Hamas."
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?

Brennan pointed out that international organizations like the Red Cross were distributing the aid.
"But I think there's still a lot of evidence with a lot of these international organizations that when we send aid into Gaza, a lot of it goes into the wrong hands," Vance said. "We don't want to basically fund two sides of the exact same conflict. Fund Hamas, fund Israel."

"Well, it's not aid to Hamas," Brennan observed. "It's aid to the Palestinian people."
"And if I could wave a magic wand and give aid to the Palestinian children, I will," Vance quipped.

In the heart of Istanbul, within a sea of pro-Palestine demonstrators, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey leveled an accusation of war crimes against Israel, promising to take its case before the world. This startling declaration came amid the escalating conflict in Gaza, as the death toll of Palestinian citizens continues to rise.

 
Israel: A War Criminal? 
President Erdogan’s bold accusation came during a pro-Palestine rally in Istanbul, where he criticized Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip. He blamed Western nations for the escalating death toll, alleging their inaction enabled Israel’s incessant attacks. The Turkish president called for a just peace and accused Israel and its allies of fostering a crusade-like atmosphere, further escalating tensions in the region.

WNU Editor: The Chinese are giving the US President the finger. They have time to talk to the governor, but none for the US President. Beijing is also sending the message that they are going to bide their time until Biden is no longer the US President.

Representative Mike Johnson vowed to support the wars in Ukraine and Israel in an interview after becoming House Speaker. 
The Congressman told Sean Hannity that China, Russia, and Iran make up an “axis of evil” that poses a huge threat to the US.

The Speaker presented Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran as a trilateral threat to Washington. “Big priorities in this moment right now. 
We have Israel being attacked, we have unrest, we have the Ukraine situation we’ve got to deal with, we have China being aggressive, we have Iran with all the meddling, and China, Russia, and Iran working together. This is a dangerous time.” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says US President Joe Biden welcomed the fact that he is going to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping. 

Mr Albanese’s remarks come after the Prime Minister wrapped up a state visit to the United States, strengthening ties and pushing for key AUKUS legislation to be passed this year. 

A major theme of the visit was policy in the Indo-Pacific, particularly towards China, and US President Joe Biden had some pointed criticism for the People’s Republic ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to China in November.  

“Australia and China have different political systems, of course, and different values,” Mr Albanese told Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell. 

“One of the reasons why the relationship with the United States is so close is because we do have that common commitment to human rights, to democracy, and to our values. 

“It’s important that Australia stabilise the relationship – that’s something that the US is seeking as well.”]]></summary>

Moscow Times/AFP: Hamas Working to Free 8 Russian-Israeli Hostages – Reports 
Hamas is trying to locate eight Russian-Israeli dual citizens among nearly 230 taken hostage during its attack on Israel after Moscow's request to free them, Russian news agencies reported Saturday. 
Russia has good relations with the Palestinian militant group, which it does not consider a terror group, and has launched a diplomatic effort to try to free hostages held in Gaza.

Israel has said it believes 229 people were taken hostage by Hamas during its massive attack on Israel on Oct. 7. 
"From the Russian side, via the Foreign Ministry, we received a list of citizens that have dual citizenship," senior Hamas representative Moussa Abu Marzook said, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.

"We are looking for those people... It is hard but we are looking. And when we find them, we will let them go."

EU leaders on Thursday failed to convince Kosovo and Serbia to make a breakthrough in the protracted push to normalise ties between the two Balkan neighbours. 
Kosovan Prime Minister Albin Kurti and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic held separate talks with top EU officials and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy in Brussels.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a proposal was put on the table to overcome a key stumbling block on establishing an association of municipalities of Serbian majority in the north of Kosovo. 
"Unhappily, the parties were not ready to agree on that, without preconditions that were unacceptable to the other party," Borrell said. "We will continue insisting and working in order to get an agreement," he added. 
The two Balkan leaders blamed each other for the failure of the talks.

Russian planes reportedly have mined the maritime corridor that Ukraine established in the western Black Sea in order to safeguard the export of grain to Europe and Africa. 
It seems to be the first time in Russia’s 21-month wider war that the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s aircraft have deployed sea mines.

Ukraine’s southern command reported the ominous development on Wednesday. 
“The enemy ... dropped four unidentified means of impact, probably bottom mines, in the Black Sea ... in the direction of navigation corridors of civil shipping,” the command stated.

Update #1: Ukraine suspends Black Sea grain corridor over threat from mines, warplanes (Reuters)
 
Update #2: Ukraine claims four mines dropped in grain shipping corridor by Russian air force (Trade Winds)
 
Update #3: Is Ukraine’s new Black Sea corridor working? Experts say it has potential (Kyiv Independent)   
WNU Editor: This is an important story with huge global consequences that many in the mainstream media are not covering. I guess the Israel - Hamas war is diverting everyone's attention (for now).]]></summary>

Clearing and collapsing these tunnels is crucial for dismantling Hamas, but it is a challenging task that strips the Israeli military of its technological advantages.

Military Times/AP: No, the US military isn’t ‘laying the groundwork’ for a draft

 
Claim: The U.S. military is planning to reinstitute the draft.

 
AP’s Assessment: False. Defense officials confirm the armed forces have made no such recommendation to Congress or the president, which are the entities empowered to authorize a draft.

 
The Facts: With America’s allies in Europe and the Middle East embroiled in conflicts with no end in sight, social media posts are claiming the U.S. military is considering mandating regular citizens to enlist in the armed forces. 
A number of those are sharing a headline from a Sept. 25 article from the Mises Institute, a libertarian group in Alabama that reads: “The US Military Is Laying the Groundwork to Reinstitute the Draft.”

WNU Editor: "U.S. military draft"  has been trending on search engines for the past few weeks. Videos like the one above and rumors on social media are probably fueling it .... Video of Biden calling for a military draft is AI-generated, not real | Fact check (USA Today). More here .... Fighting 'Joe Biden's wars': False rumor of 'draft' spreads across social media as 'medicated' Gen Z slammed for not signing up (Meaww), and here .... Fact Check: Video of Joe Biden calling for a military draft was created with AI (Reuters).
Just one more note. 
On the eve of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the Kyiv government was telling everyone to not worry, and to stay home. Within 24 hours of Russia's invasion, the Ukraine government immediately closed its border to men of military age who can be drafted. The U.S. government will do the same. Telling everyone that everything is fine, until the very moment that the "shit hits the fan".]]></summary>

The Air Force is hopeful that the B-21 Raider stealth bomber will take to the skies for the first time before the end of the year. 
The U.S. Air Force's first pre-production B-21 Raider stealth bomber is now undergoing taxi testing, moving around the sprawling Plant 42 in Palmdale under its own power. This is the latest developmental milestone for the aircraft as it continues to move closer to its first flight, which could come before the end of the year. 
"I can confirm the B-21 is conducting ground taxi activities. Rigorous testing is a critical step in the B-21 flight test program," an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to The War Zone today. "Extensive testing evaluates systems, components, and functionalities. This testing allows us to mitigate risks, optimize design, and enhance operational effectiveness."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
