Oil posted the worst weekly loss since the early months of the coronavirus pandemic as banking turmoil poisoned investor sentiment. 
West Texas Intermediate lost nearly 13% this week, the largest drop in almost three years. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and troubles at Credit Suisse Group AG drove investors from risk assets, with oil-options covering accelerating the selloff. 
“Crude action this week reminded many of how quickly the commodity can be decimated by macro economic events,” said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. “The commodity broke a significant level of support as the market tries to quantify the economic ramifications of banking turmoil.” 
Traders had been waiting for a catalyst to break prices out of the relatively narrow trading range that has dominated the market as expectations for rebounding Chinese demand compete with weaker economic outlook in the West.

Global cocaine production has reached record levels as demand rebounds following Covid lockdowns, a new report has found. 
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime said coca cultivation rose by 35% between 2020 and 2021 to record levels. 
Findings suggest new hubs for trafficking have emerged in West and Central Africa. 
The report also said traffickers were using international postal services more often to get drugs to consumers. 
"Globally, the use of parcel and courier services increased significantly during the Covid-related lockdown due to restrictions on passenger flights," the Global Report on Cocaine report said.

   CNBC: Macron enrages France by forcing through pension bill with no vote. But few think he’ll be forced out

 * But anger from opposition parties and the public will remain. 
* Macron may emerge weakened despite passing changes he has pushed for since he was first elected in 2017. 
A coalition of French lawmakers on Friday filed a no confidence motion against President Emmanuel Macron following chaotic scenes in the country’s lower house of parliament the day before.

   CNBC: President Erdogan says Turkey will start ratifying Finland’s NATO application 
* Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said: “We have decided to initiate the ratification of Finland’s accession process to NATO in our parliament.”
* In May, Finland and Sweden sent applications to join the military alliance.
* They decided to put an end to their policies of neutrality and military non-alignment in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday approved Finland’s accession to NATO after months of talks, but added that discussions with Sweden will continue. 
“We have decided to initiate the ratification of Finland’s accession process to NATO in our parliament,” Erdogan said in Ankara, according to a Reuters translation, as he met his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto. 
Erdogan added that he hoped the Turkish parliament would endorse Finland’s bid before the country’s May 14 elections.

(Reuters) -Slovakia on Friday became the second of Ukraine's allies to provide MIG-29 fighter jets which Kyiv believes are crucial to repel Russia's year-long invasion. 
Slovakia joined Poland, which announced its delivery of the planes on Thursday. 
Both the NATO members neighbour Ukraine.  Its fleet of 11 MiG-29 planes was retired last summer and most of them are not in operational condition.
It will send those that are operational and the rest will go for spare parts.  Slovakia will also supply part of its KUB air-defence system, Prime Minister Eduard Heger said. 
"Today, the government decided and unanimously approved an international agreement (on the donation)," Heger said.

OTTAWA — Canada is banning the import of Russian steel and aluminum as part of its sanctions regime, as Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly raises the possibility of regime change in Moscow. 
Joly made the remarks at a Friday press conference where she discussed the importance of maintaining a diplomatic presence in Moscow. 
“We’re able to see how much we’re isolating the Russian regime right now — because we need to do so economically, politically and diplomatically — and what are the impacts also on society, and how much we’re seeing potential regime change in Russia,” she said.

Boris Pistorius, the defense minister of Germany, has outlined how NATO would respond should China transfer weapons to Russia in the ongoing war in Ukraine. 
On the sidelines of a summit in Stockholm, Pistorius said the support for Kyiv will be strengthened even further if China starts supplying weapons to Russia, DW News reported on Thursday, noting that Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg were also participating in the Stockholm meeting and discussed the supply of weapons to Kyiv. 
China has denied allegations that it had suggested supplying Russia with weapons. CIA Director William Burns has said that the U.S. was "confident" Beijing is considering supplying Moscow with lethal equipment to support its invasion of Ukraine.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China is concerned about an escalation of the war in Ukraine and hopes Moscow and Kyiv will hold peace talks, senior Chinese diplomat Qin Gang told his Ukrainian counterpart on a phone call on Thursday. 
China, which has refrained from condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, has urged both sides to agree to a gradual de-escalation leading to a comprehensive ceasefire in its 12-point paper on the "political resolution of the Ukraine crisis". 
The plan, which received a lukewarm welcome on both sides, called for the protection of civilians and respect for each other's sovereignty.

CNN: Japan and South Korea agree to mend ties as leaders meet following years of dispute 
The leaders of South Korea and Japan promised to resume ties in a fence-mending summit – the first such meeting in 12 years – as the two neighbors seek to confront threats from North Korea and rising concerns about China. 
“From now on, I would like to open a new chapter in Japan-South Korea relations through frequent visits by both sides that are not tied down by formality,” Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in Tokyo after meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. 
Mutual visits by Japanese and South Korean leaders have been suspended for 12 years as ties soured over several issues, including a wartime labor dispute.

Washington Post: With Russia visit, Xi pursues effort to upend U.S.-led global order 
Fresh off a legislative congress where he cemented his vision for governing China, Xi Jinping turned to how he would create a better world order. 
It would be based on mutual respect, tolerance and equality — and China would be its natural leader, he told heads of political parties for an array of countries, including Russia and South Africa, Nicaragua and East Timor. “Chinese-style modernization does not follow the old path of colonial plunder or the hegemony of strong countries,” Xi told them in a video call Wednesday, sitting at a desk surrounded by Chinese and Communist Party flags. 
“The world does not need another Cold War,” he said, announcing his new concept — the “global civilization initiative,” a set of lofty guiding principles for a “new type of international relations” that China is building. 
Xi’s comments were a clear rebuke of the United States — and a reflection of the harder tack he is taking as he ramps up China’s diplomatic efforts with an expected visit to Russia.

House Republicans are investigating President Joe Biden and his family for alleged influence peddling, which Democrats dismiss as hyper-partisan attacks. 
* The Oversight and Accountability Committee identified $1.3 million paid to Hunter Biden, others. 
* The panel said payments also went to James and Hallie Biden, and companies associated with Bidens.
* Democrats have dismissed the inquiry as a hyper-partisan attack aimed at President Joe Biden. 
WASHINGTON – House Republicans announced Thursday that President Joe Biden’s relatives received a combined $1.3 million from a business associate with links to China, the latest salvo in an investigation the Biden administration has dismissed as politically motivated.  Hunter Biden, the president’s son; James Biden, the president’s brother; Hallie Biden, the president’s daughter-in-law; and a fourth unnamed Biden received the payments from business associate Rob Walker, according to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee. 
The money was paid out after Walker received a $3 million wire transfer from a Chinese company, according to the panel.

Insider: All 500 original members of a Ukrainian battalion were killed or wounded in fighting with Russia, commander says 
* Ukraine's defense is being hindered by the loss of experienced soldiers, The Washington Post reported. 
* One commander said all 500 original members of his battalion had been killed or injured. 
* Soldiers with significant combat experience "are all already dead or wounded," the commander said. 
The war in Ukraine is bleeding both sides, with each suffering more than 100,000 military casualties (killed and wounded) since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last year. 
But with Moscow able to draft fighters from a population that dwarfs that of Ukraine, there is growing concern that Kyiv is less capable of suffering sustained losses — and that this will jeopardize its ability to strike back this spring, The Washington Post reported on Monday. 
The gravity of the situation is illustrated by the experience of Ukraine's 46th Air Assault Brigade.
A commander of a battalion within the brigade told the Post that he'd lost every one of the 500 people he commanded back in February 2022, leading them to be replaced with fresh recruits far less capable on the battlefield.

WNU Editor: The key part of the Washington Post article is here .... 
 .... After a year of war, Kupol, a lieutenant colonel, said his battalion is unrecognizable. Of about 500 soldiers, roughly 100 were killed in action and another 400 wounded, leading to complete turnover. Kupol said he was the sole military professional in the battalion, and he described the struggle of leading a unit composed entirely of inexperienced troops. 
The Washington Post article is here .... Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow.]]></summary>

Politico: ‘Ukraine doesn’t have any time to waste’: U.S. races to prepare Kyiv for spring offensive  
Washington is increasingly concerned about Ukraine’s dwindling supply of ammo and air defenses. 
The U.S. military is rushing equipment to the battlefield and training Ukrainian forces at a rapid pace, ahead of a major offensive against Russia expected by late spring. 
 Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin projected a sense of urgency on Wednesday after a virtual meeting of the multinational Ukraine Defense Contact Group, saying that “Ukraine doesn’t have any time to waste.” 
“We have to deliver swiftly and fully on our promised commitments,” Austin said. “That includes delivering our armored capabilities to the battlefield and ensuring that Ukrainian soldiers get the training, spare parts and maintenance support that they need to use these new systems, as soon as possible.”

WNU Editor: There has been a number of US main stream news publications in the past week painting a more realistic (albeit gloomy) assessment of the war. The above Politico is another article that is shifting the media narrative on what are the prospects in this war. 
As to the above Politico article quoting US officials that Ukraine will be launching a counter-offensive in May. My own sources in Ukraine doubt it. They are all telling me the same thing. Ukraine does not have enough experienced soldiers to conduct such an operation, let alone not enough artillery, equipment, and ammo to push forward. 
One more note. The Politico article quotes US officials that 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in this war. My sources in Ukraine say the number killed are 125,000+. But what is more shocking is that there are 50,000+ reported as missing, and because they are listed as missing they are not categorized as dead.]]></summary>

Reuters: Poland to Send Ukraine 4 MiG-29 Jets in Coming Days 
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland will send Ukraine four MiG-29 fighter jets in coming days, the president said on Thursday, making it the first of Kyiv's allies to provide such aircraft.

It has said that any transfer of jets would be as part of a coalition. 
"Firstly, literally within the next few days, we will hand over, as far as I remember, four aircraft to Ukraine in full working order," Andrzej Duda told a news conference. 
 "The rest are being prepared, serviced."  On Tuesday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that deliveries could be made in four to six weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: In the above video the Military Summary Channel breaks down the history of US drones always being in the area when Ukraine launched major strikes on targets in Crimea. It is a long list, and you have to wonder why Russia has done nothing until now to stop it. 
As to what is my take on this incident. It is hard to say because there is a lot of information that is still unknown. 
But what is known is that a US military drone, with its transponder turned off, was flying towards Crimea and had entered Russia's Air Identification Zone with no warning. Besides entering a region that Russia has designated as a war zone that all civilian aircraft are prohibited from flying in, it also ignored all air traffic control calls. Russian jets were then scrambled to intercept it, and the rest is history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran and the United States have reached an agreement to exchange prisoners, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV on Sunday, adding that he hoped the exchange would take place soon.
"Regarding the issue of prisoner swaps between Iran and the U.S. we have reached an agreement in the recent days and if everything goes well on the U.S. side, I think we will witness a prisoner exchange in a short period," Amirabdollahian said.
"On our part everything is ready, while the U.S. is currently working on the final technical coordination."
One of several Americans held in Iran is Siamak Namazi, a businessman with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, who was sentenced in 2016 to 10 years in prison for spying and cooperating with the U.S. government.
Emad Sharghi, an Iranian-American businessman was first arrested in 2018 when he was working for a tech investment company, is also jailed in Iran, as is Iranian-American environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British citizenship.
Iranian sources told Reuters that two regional countries were involved in the series of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington for the release of prisoners.
For years, Tehran has sought the release of more than a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of miles from the glitz of Sunday's Oscars, the first Irish language film to earn a nomination is sparking renewed interest in a native tongue spoken by so few it is considered endangered by the United Nations cultural agency.
Competing for best international feature, "An Cailín Ciúin" (The Quiet Girl) last year became the first Irish language film to gross more than 1 million euros ($1.06 million) at the UK and Irish box office. It has remained a fixture in cinemas across English-speaking Ireland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court's powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.
As the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.
"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids," said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.
The protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.
National police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.
The now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and "will not yield to any political pressure on the matter".
Netanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.
"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister'," said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.

Greece has asked for others to imitate the Vatican Museums after they agreed this month to return three 2,500-year-old pieces of the Parthenon. London and Athens are in talks over the Parthenon Sculptures held by the British Museum.
The Parthenon, which is on the Acropolis in Athens, was completed in the fifth century BC as a temple to the goddess Athena, and its decorative friezes contain some of the greatest examples of ancient Greek sculpture.

The 20-year-old man suspected of keeping 11 people hostage in a pharmacy for five hours on Friday in Germany's south-western city of Karlsruhe has been taken into custody, authorities said on Saturday
According to the public prosecutor's office and the police, a judge issued an arrest warrant on charges of hostage-taking.
The 20-year-old suspect, who is known to the police, held the 11 hostages for almost five hours until special forces stormed the pharmacy and overpowered him.
The perpetrator was armed but he acted alone, police said earlier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has deplored new "brutal terrorist attacks" by Russia on cities and towns across his country.

Day and night there are these attacks, Zelensky said in his nightly video message broadcast in Kiev on Saturday. "Rockets and artillery, drones and mortars: The vicious state uses a variety of weapons with the one goal of destroying life and leaving nothing human behind," Zelensky said.
"Ruins, rubble, craters where missiles hit are the self-portrait of Russia that it paints where life exists without Russia," the Ukrainian head of state said. The country stands for evil, he said. "It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment."
Zelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.]]></summary>

Rosalia Messina Denaro was arrested earlier this month not far from Palermo, where her godfather brother was caught on January 16 after 30 years on the run.
She is accused of issuing orders, keeping the books and transmitting secret messages for her sibling while he was in hiding.
For many years, women linked to the Cosa Nostra Mafia seemed born to become widows, portrayed in films as black-veiled Madonnas, leading funeral processions in sorrowful dignity.
The reality is far more complex, with many wives, daughters and sisters playing active roles while their men are on the run, in prison…]]></summary>

BEIJING (Reuters) -Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China's premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity's sclerotic stock market.
Li's back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.
In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai's new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China's hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.

The four US citizens, two of whom died, were snatched at gunpoint after crossing the border into crime-plagued Tamaulipas state on Friday in a minivan, apparently so that one could have cosmetic surgery.
Tamaulipas prosecutor Irving Barrios said that a warrant had been executed for five people for the crimes of kidnapping and homicide.
They are the same five men who were found Thursday with their hands bound on a street in the city of Matamoros, apparently dumped by fellow members of the Gulf Cartel, a source in the prosecutor's office told AFP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley apparently won't be getting the vote of at least one Iowa man who wants no part of helping Ukraine beat back Russia's year-long military invasion.
As reported by CBS News' Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a "bigger war" in the future.
The man angrily shouted that he was "done" with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.
According to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.

The issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.
Traditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while "America First" Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moscow on Friday accused foreign countries of fomenting days of mass protests in Georgia, likening them to an attempted coup designed to sow tension on Russia's borders.
Hundreds of Georgians rallied for a fourth day outside parliament, as lawmakers dropped controversial "foreign agent" legislation that triggered violent clashes between police and protesters earlier this week.
The days-long demonstrations point to turmoil over the future in Georgia, which aims to join the EU and NATO, much to the frustration of Moscow, which invaded in 2008 and recognized two separatist territories in the north of the country.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
