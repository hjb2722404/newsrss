        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell reveals there has been an untimely naval incident between Australian and Chinese ships.

The incident came just as relations were beginning to strengthen between the two nations.

Reportedly, Australian Naval divers received minor injuries after contact with sonar from a Chinese Naval ship, despite Australian communication to China’s vessel that the divers were nearby.

Defence Minister Richard Marles confirmed the incident and says the Australian government has “expressed its serious concerns” over the “unsafe and unprofessional interaction”.

“Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a professional and safe manner.”]]></summary>

Nonprofit group Media Matters added Apple, Disney, Comcast, Lionsgate Entertainment, and Paramount Global to its list of companies pausing advertising on X.
"Lionsgate has suspended advertising on X because of Elon Musk's recent antisemitic tweets," a spokesperson for the motion picture production and distribution company told AFP.
IBM on Thursday said it stopped advertising on X due to a report its ads were shown next to pro-Nazi posts at X.
Apple and Disney did not reply to requests for comment.
"Major blue-chip companies are announcing they will suspend all advertising," the group said on a web page featuring a running list.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sydney Morning Herald: Australian navy divers injured after sonar pulses detected from Chinese warship 
A Chinese warship’s “unsafe and unprofessional” use of sonar is suspected of injuring Australian navy divers during an operation in international waters.
Divers from HMAS Toowoomba suffered minor ear damage in Tuesday’s incident involving a People’s Liberation Army-Navy destroyer, which used its powerful sonar despite being warned Australian personnel were underwater nearby. 
The incident occurred before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit, sparking questions from the federal opposition about why the details were withheld until Saturday.

The United Nations said it would not be able to deliver basic necessities to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Friday due to communication collapsing in the Palestinian enclave and a lack of fuel. The World Health Organization warned that the paralyzed aid would mean the "immediate possibility of starvation" for the roughly 2.3 million people living in the embattled region. 
"The communications network in #Gaza is down because there is NO fuel," the U.N. agency that operates in Gaza, UNRWA, said in a statement on social media. "This makes it impossible to manage or coordinate humanitarian aid convoys."

RT: Palestinians believe they can’t coexist with Israel – poll 
Many Palestinians say they will “never forgive” Israel for its military action in Gaza, according to a survey 
A significant majority of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza say that they don’t envision a future where they can coexist peacefully alongside Israel, according to the findings of a poll. 
The densely-populated Gaza enclave has been subjected to an unprecedented bombardment for more than five weeks as part of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s vow to “eliminate Hamas” in response to the militant group’s cross-border attack on October 7.

Eugene Rumer and Andrew S. Weiss, Wall Street Journal: It’s Time to End Magical Thinking About Russia’s Defeat 
Putin has withstood the West’s best efforts to reverse his invasion of Ukraine, and his hold on power is firm. The U.S. and its allies need a new strategy: containment. 
As Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress, not to mention the pro-Putin leanings of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.
 Putin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.

National Interest: The Joe Biden-Xi Jinping Summit: Nothing Accomplished? 
Despite Washington and Beijing’s apparent satisfaction with the meeting, the tensions at the heart of the relationship show no signs of abating. 
 After meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in San Franciso on November 15, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping (separately) announced several agreements that reflect their shared interest in reducing U.S.-China tensions. They agreed to resume military-to-military exchanges at both senior and operational levels. They also agreed to improve cooperation on counternarcotics, primarily aimed at ending the flow of Chinese-origin fentanyl into the United States. In addition, Washington and Beijing will expand dialogue on addressing the potential risks of artificial intelligence, continue to hold working-level consultations on a wider range of bilateral issues, and seek to increase educational and cultural exchanges between the two countries. Biden and Xi also hailed the agreements announced earlier in the week on enhanced bilateral cooperation on climate issues.

New US aid for Ukraine risks slipping to mid-December and maybe longer, casting doubt on Washington’s ability to keep up the flow of weapons that both the Biden administration and the Ukrainian government say is vital. 
Ukraine’s congressional backers are engaged in a tough battle over an expansive aid package whose fate is now enmeshed in a partisan fight over border policies and torn from must-pass bills that would prompt swift action. 
The soonest Congress could complete negotiations and pass new Ukraine assistance is mid-December, nearly two months after President Joe Biden first requested $61 billion for the country in its war against Russia. 

The US has begun restricting the flow of military assistance because of the wait, according to a Defense Department spokeswoman.

It has the worst gender pay gap among OECD nations, while its traditional workplace culture results in many women giving up their careers after childbirth. Now the country has recorded the lowest fertility rate in the world, with women of reproductive age having fewer than one child on average. Sex crimes against women are frequent in a criminal justice system that often issues light sentences to perpetrators. We meet feminists who face online and physical threats including those who vow publicly not to marry or have children in protest of conservative societal attitudes. Meanwhile the country’s ultra-conservative government said it plans to abolish South Korea’s Gender Equality Ministry. We also talk to an advisor to the ruling political party who claims radical feminism has more in common with fascist parties in Europe and says anger over the issue has reached boiling point.]]></summary>

The fishing port of 4,000 people on Iceland's south coast was evacuated on November 11 after magma shifting under the Earth's crust caused hundreds of earthquakes -- a warning of a likely volcanic eruption.
Thousands of smaller tremors have shaken the region since.
With massive crevices ripping roads apart and buildings' concrete foundations shattered, the once picturesque Grindavik now resembles a warzone.

Kyiv Independent: Zelensky: Artillery munition deliveries to Ukraine have decreased since Israel-Hamas War 
The delivery of artillery shells to Ukraine from Western allies has decreased since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 16. 
In particular, supplies of the much-needed 155mm artillery shells have "really slowed down," he said. 
Zelensky added that the U.S. did not formally say that they would stop or decrease the flow of artillery shells to Ukraine, but rather that "everyone is fighting for (stockpiles) themselves." 
"This is life. I'm not saying that this is positive, but this is life, and we have to defend what's ours."

 WNU Editor: During the Second World War 70% of the military casualties on the front-lines came from artillery duels and strikes. The same can be said about this war, maybe even higher if one includes drone strikes. 
Bottom line. If supplies of artillery shells to Ukraine are being cut and/or stopped, this war will end in 2024 with a Russian victory.

Russia's justice ministry said it had "lodged an administrative legal claim with the Supreme Court to recognise the International LGBT public movement as extremist and ban its activity in Russia."
The ministry did not specify whether it was seeking the closure of any specific groups or organisations, or if the designation would apply more broadly to the LGBTQ community, causes and individuals.
The proposed ban is the latest in a long-standing crackdown against LGBTQ people in Russia, which has escalated since Russia launched its offensive on Ukraine last February.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Public sector employees and transport workers across Italy went on strike Friday in an action pitting trade unions against the hard-right government in Rome over its 2024 budget.
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has been accused of using the budget to chase votes ahead of next year's European Parliament elections at the expense of workers and pensioners.
"Meloni, the people are hungry", read one banner held aloft by protesters gathered in Rome's historic Piazza del Popolo, while thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets in Genoa and Milan.
The walkout was called by two of the country's largest unions, the CGIL and UIL, which say the tax-cutting budget woefully underfunds key sectors such as health, education and industry.
Teachers, healthcare workers, taxi drivers and postal workers were called to strike for eight hours nationwide, while some in the private sector, from steelworkers to shopkeepers, could join in central Italy.
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also transport minister, imposed restrictions on the strike to reduce the disruption, to the outrage of union leaders.
In what he described as a compromise based on "common sense", he halved the duration of the transport workers and firefighters strike to four hours during the morning, while air travel is not included at all.
CGIL general secretary Maurizio Landini accused him of an "attack on the right to strike".
The unions had sought to have their walkout defined as a general strike, which would have been allowed to last 24 hours.
But the watchdog that arbitrates strikes in Italy said it did not meet the criteria, as several sectors were excluded from the action, which is also being spread out over five days.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A French senator was in custody Friday on suspicion of drugging an MP with a view to assaulting her, prosecutors and sources familiar with the case told AFP.
Joel Guerriau, a centrist senator from western France, was being held for "administering to a person without their knowledge a substance likely to diminish their judgement or self-control to commit a rape or sexual assault," prosecutors said on Thursday.
While the prosecutors named the victim only as "a woman, who filed a complaint", several sources familiar with the case told AFP she was an MP.
She allegedly felt strange after accepting a drink on Tuesday night at the 66-year-old senator's Paris home.
Prosecutors said the two were not in an intimate relationship.
Tests revealed that she had ecstasy in her system, investigators added, prompting her to file a criminal complaint.
Guerriau was arrested and held in custody under caught-in-the-act rules allowing police to override his parliamentary immunity, prosecutors said.
Broadcaster RMC, which first reported the story, said that police had searched his office and home, where prosecutors confirmed they found ecstasy.
Originally a banker, Guerriau has been a member of the senate since 2011 and is deputy head of the foreign and military affairs committee.
His lawyer, Remi-Pierre Drai, said he was "outraged to see information from the investigation in the press".
"I'm amazed that the victim's name has not been leaked, unlike my client's," he added.

A second heavy drill is to be airlifted into the northern state of Uttarakhand after the existing giant machine -- itself flown in as a replacement by the air force on Wednesday -- hit a boulder, officials said.
Excavators have been removing debris since Sunday morning to create an escape route for the workers after a portion of the tunnel they were building collapsed in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
Rescue efforts have been slowed by debris that has continued to fall.
Engineers are trying to drive a steel pipe about 90 centimetres (nearly three feet) wide through the debris -- wide enough for the trapped men to squeeze through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Russian court on Thursday sentenced artist Alexandra Skochilenko to seven years in prison for spreading "false information" about the army after she swapped supermarket price tags with slogans criticizing Russia's offensive in Ukraine.
The 33-year-old, known as Sasha, is the latest among thousands of Russians to be detained, jailed or fined for speaking out against Moscow's military intervention.
Supporters shouted "shame" and "we're with you Sasha" after the judge, Oksana Demiasheva, read out the verdict, an AFP journalist in court reported.
Some, mainly young people, pulled out banners saying "she should not go to prison", while her lawyers left without giving any comment.
Skochilenko wore a colorful T-shirt with a large red heart printed on it. She made a heart shape with her hands and smiled to supporters during the hearing.
"Every person in this room wants only one thing: Peace. Why fight?" she said in a closing statement.
Skochilenko had said in an earlier hearing that she "just wanted to stop the war. That was my motivation".
'They give less for murder'
"It's not Sasha who should go to prison, but the people who convicted her," 20-year-old Anton, who declined to give his full name, citing security concerns, told AFP after the verdict was announced.
One of the messages included claims about a Russian strike on a theatre in Mariupol that was reported to have left hundreds dead.
"The cost of this war is the life of our children" and "Putin has been lying to us from television screens for 20 years" were written on other tags.
An elderly shopper reported the swapped tags to police.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paul Poast, The Atlantic: Not a World War But a World at War 
Just in the past 24 months, an astonishing number of armed conflicts have started, renewed, or escalated. Some had been fully frozen, meaning that the sides had not sustained direct combat in years; others were long simmering, meaning that low-level fighting would intermittently erupt. All have now become active. 
The list encompasses not just the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, but hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, Serbian military measures against Kosovo, fighting in Eastern Congo, complete turmoil in Sudan since April, and a fragile cease-fire in Tigray that Ethiopia seems poised to break at any time. Syria and Yemen have not exactly been quiet during this period, and gangs and cartels continuously menace governments, including those in Haiti and Mexico. All of this comes on top of the prospect of a major war breaking out in East Asia, such as by China invading the island of Taiwan.

WNU Editor: The last paragraph of the above post sums it perfectly .... 
.... Wars were already a persistent feature of the international system. But they were not widespread. War was always happening somewhere, in other words, but war was not happening everywhere. The above dynamics could change that tendency. The prevalence of war, not just its persistence, could now be our future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SFGate: Joe Biden floats Gavin Newsom presidency at APEC welcome reception in San Francisco 
President Joe Biden led off his remarks at an APEC welcome reception in San Francisco on Wednesday evening by semi-jokingly floating a future Gavin Newsom presidency. 
“I want to talk about Gov. Newsom. Want to thank him,” Biden said at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, according to a transcript released by the White House. 
“He’s been one hell of a governor, man. Matter of fact, he could be anything he wants. He could have the job I’m looking for.” 
Newsom, the governor of California, has for years been a rumored presidential candidate. Those rumors have subsided slightly in recent months, as Newsom has taken on more of a surrogate role for Biden’s 2024 re-election campaign. But even a full-throated endorsement of Biden hasn’t fully killed off the presumption that Newsom is waiting in the wings, either as a 2024 last-minute replacement, or for a full-fledged 2028 run.

Previously, we focused on the southern Zaporozhye front.  Now let’s focus on Kharkov, in the northeast. 
The attached document, fully verified for authenticity, is a July report to the Chief of Staff of the operational-tactical group “Sumy”. 
The report essentially says that it’s impossible to withdraw two thirds of the A7383 unit from the battlefield to recover combat readiness because the remaining one third is incapable of holding the fort – which happens to extend along 55.5 km.

WNU Editor: Conflicts like the Russia - Ukraine war where both sides are not willing to compromise to end the war do take a long time to resolve itself. This war will not be an exception. But all wars do come to an end, and the above analysis by Pepe Escobar is repeating what all of my contacts/friends/and family members in Ukraine have been telling me for the past few months. 
Bottom line. Time is not on Ukraine's side.

 
Update: I concur with the analysis below on Russia's current war strategy.

I think it's pretty clear what the Russians are doing with their ongoing "mud season offensive" in Ukraine, really a collection of local attacks across the length of the front line (with the exception of Kherson, but the Ukrainians are playing themselves there).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New Hampshire Democratic Party's office in Belknap County was hit with antisemitic vandalism and a swastika sometime this Thursday, NBC News reported. 
According to reports, a flyer claiming the Jews were responsible for 9/11 was placed on an outside window along with a swastika. Also found was an image of a Star of David with a knife through it. 
"Hate crimes and civil rights violations have no place in New Hampshire," said a spokesperson for Attorney General John Formella. "The attorney general’s office is committed to working with our local, state, and federal partners to identify these acts and their perpetrators and to pursuing action to the fullest extent possible."

In a post to X, Rep. Chris Pappas, D-(NH) wrote, "I’m thinking of all my friends in Laconia tonight. This antisemitic vandalism is part of a surge in hateful attacks on the Jewish community across the country. There is simply no place for bigotry and hate in our society, and we must speak with one voice to condemn it."
As NBC News points out, the incident comes as law enforcement agencies report a significant spike in antisemitic hate crimes around the country.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-16T16:26:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than 100 people, including 16 children, have died and over 700,000 been forced out of their homes in the Horn of Africa due to flash flooding, the British charity Save the Children said Thursday.
The region, particularly Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, has been lashed by unrelenting downpours since the beginning of the month due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, inundating homes and farmland.
About 46 people had died in Kenya, 32 in Somalia and another 33 in Ethiopia, Save the Children said, warning the rains were "showing no signs of slowing down".
The Horn of Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events are occurring with increased frequency and intensity.
The region is emerging from the worst drought in four decades after multiple failed rainy seasons that left millions of people in need and devastated crops and livestock.
"Heavy flooding and displacement have cut off families and children from basic services including access to food, healthcare, water and hygiene services," said Xavier Joubert, Ethiopia director for Save the Children.
"With that comes the real risk of waterborne diseases including cholera and measles."
Humanitarian groups have warned that the situation is only likely to worsen and called for urgent global intervention as El Nino is expected to last until at least April 2024.
El Nino is typically associated with increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere.
Between October 1997 and January 1998, devastating floods caused by El Nino led to more than 6,000 deaths in five Horn of Africa countries.
At least 1,800 people died in Somalia where the Juba River burst its banks.
At the end of 2019, 265 people died and tens of thousands were displaced during two months of relentless rainfall in several countries in East Africa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A grandson of French war hero and former president Charles de Gaulle said Thursday he wanted Russian citizenship, saying Russia offered “great possibilities”.
Pierre de Gaulle is little known in France, but Russian state media have heralded his pro-Kremlin statements as proof that leading Western voices support Moscow’s assault in Ukraine.
“It would be an honour for me to acquire Russian citizenship,” he told a journalist at the Saint Petersburg Cultural Forum, Russian agencies said.
He also said that Russia was “fighting for traditional values, the family and spirituality” in Ukraine and that “NATO had lost”.
This is not the first time the previously obscure scion of France’s most famous political family has made waves.
Yves de Gaulle, his eldest brother, told Le Parisien daily in January that his sibling’s views “concern no one else other than himself – not me, not our family and even less the general.”
Charles de Gaulle headed the French resistance movement from London during World War II, before returning triumphantly to France.

As president, he positioned France as a hinge between the US-dominated Western bloc and the Soviet Union during the Cold War – a position that his grandson claims to represent. 
But historians agree de Gaulle also kept France firmly anchored in the Western alliance. His views are a source of debate in France, particularly when applied to contemporary events.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
