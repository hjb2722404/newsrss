        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would be in “extremely poor taste” for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to attend the King’s coronation as it’s “very clear that they’re not welcome”, says writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue.

“I personally hope they’re not here just because I feel like this is not an occasion for Netflix cameras,” Ms Krakue told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.

“It is a national event and we’ve like to keep it that way, we’d like to keep the tawdry, gossipy stories out of the tabloids and focus on what really matters.

“It would be in extremely poor taste if they did choose to come.”]]></summary>

Accompanied by The Sovereign’s Escort of the Household Cavalry, they will travel down The Mall via Admiralty Arch, take the south side of Trafalgar Square, then go along Whitehall and Parliament Street, take the east and south sides of Parliament Square to Broad Sanctuary, before arriving at the Abbey.

It’s also been revealed two different gilded coaches will be used for coronation, and King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla will travel to Westminster Abbey in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach first used by Queen Elizabeth in 2014.

On their return to Buckingham Palace they will travel in the 260-year-old Gold State Coach which was used by the Queen for her coronation in 1953.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been reported Kate Middleton found the interaction with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at the Windsor walkabout following the Queen's death to be extremely difficult. 

“There were always sort of murmurings within the media that the relationship between the Sussexes and the Cambridges had really broken down at the time,” said writer and broadcaster Esther Krakue. 

“Clearly that relationship had broken down quite significantly already and obviously the walkabout was not her idea, it was her husband Prince William’s idea so she had to go along with it because it was seen as extending an olive branch,” Ms Krakue told Sky News host Caroline Di Russo.

“But I can imagine it’s quite difficult for someone to play nice publicly with people that have had no qualms in slating you and defaming your character in the way that they have done.”]]></summary>

Defense One: NATO Plans Record Air Exercise as Finland Joins Alliance

 
Air Defender 2023 exercise will include 100 U.S. aircraft, 2,000 troops, in “largest transatlantic movement” the Air National Guard has ever done. 
As NATO brings Finland into the fold, the U.S. and Germany are preparing for the largest deployment of U.S. air forces to Europe since the formation of the U.S.-led security alliance. 
The upcoming exercise, Air Defender 2023, will test the Air National Guard’s “ability to rapidly deploy and rapidly employ [forces],” similar to what the United States would have to do if the Ukraine war spreads to NATO, said Lt. Gen. Michael Loh, director of the Air National Guard. “It is the largest transatlantic movement we've done.” 
The Air National Guard, which maintains units for “prompt mobilization during war” in addition to its role in homeland defense, will send about 100 aircraft to Germany for the 10-day exercise in June, Loh said during a press conference Tuesday. The exercise will include aircraft the U.S. is about to retire, such as A-10s and F-15Cs, as well as new aircraft, such as F-35s, upgraded F-16s, and KC-46s, Loh said.

Antiwar.com: CIA Director Tells Saudis the US Was Blindsided By Iran Normalization

Politico: Biden’s informal review of Saudi Arabia 
The Biden administration just can’t quit Saudi Arabia.

After Riyadh-led OPEC+ cut oil production last year, a move that would bulge Russia’s wallet, the administration promised to reevaluate the state of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. 
President JOE BIDEN even threatened “consequences” for the kingdom, a signal that the decadeslong cozy relationship was poised for a downgrade. 
Many months later, there haven’t been any consequences or shifts. CIA Director WILLIAM BURNS even made an unannounced visit to Saudi this week to reaffirm close intelligence ties between Washington and Riyadh. 
The reason is that the administration never actually conducted a formal review, per multiple U.S. officials NatSec Daily spoke to. There were numerous inter-agency discussions and sensitive diplomatic conversations during the course of the normal policy making process. But there was neither a determined start to the reevaluation, nor will there be an end. It’s an ongoing, amorphous conversation.

Israeli jets hit Syrian military targets on Sunday in response to rockets launched towards Israeli controlled territory overnight, Israel’s military said, as violence flared again following cross-border exchanges of fire during the week. 
State media in Syria reported explosions in the vicinity of the capital Damascus as Israel said its forces continued to hit Syrian territory after six rockets were fired overnight towards the Golan Heights. 
Israel said artillery and drone strikes hit the rocket launchers and were followed by airstrikes against a Syrian army compound, military radar systems and artillery posts.

US show of force comes as Pentagon extends aircraft carrier deployment following last month's lethal attack by Iran-backed militias on US personnel in Syria. 
The US Navy deployed a nuclear-powered submarine capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Middle East waters via the Suez Canal, a spokesperson revealed Saturday. 
The Pentagon's rare disclosure of the location of one of its Ohio-class submarines came amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran after an American military contractor was killed by a drone attack on a US base in Syria last month. 
The USS Florida arrived in the region before transiting the canal on Friday "to help ensure regional maritime security and stability," Cdr. Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for the US Navy's 5th Fleet, told Al-Monitor via email.

Middle East Eye: US leaked documents allege Mossad urged protests against Netanyahu's reforms

 
Israel vehemently denies reports which suggest that Washington spied on its ally 
Leaked US intelligence documents allege that the Israeli spy body Mossad secretly encouraged people to join protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed judicial overhaul. 
The documents, dating back to "early to mid-February", state that Mossad's leadership had "advocated for Mossad officials and Israeli citizens to protest the new Israeli government's proposed judicial reforms including several explicit calls to action that decried the Israeli government". 
The intelligence memo does not state who made the order to encourage Mossad employees and civilians to join the protests but notes that the intelligence came from signals intelligence - meaning the US spied on its closest ally in the region.

Politico:  Macron fails to move Xi Jinping over Russia’s war on Ukraine

 
French leader also commits diplomatic faux pas at Beijing press conference. 
BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping showed no sign of changing his position over Russia’s war on Ukraine after talks Thursday with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. 
On the second day of Macron’s state visit to China, Xi took his long-standing line on Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — saying that “all sides” have “reasonable security concerns” — and gave no hint he would use his influence to help end the conflict. 
“China is willing to jointly appeal with France to the international community to remain rational and calm,” was as far as the Chinese leader would go during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

WNU Editor: French President Macron And EU President Ursula von der Leyen belief that they could go to Beijing and change Chinese President X's mind on Russia just two weeks after President Xi told Russian President Putin that together they were going to make changes on a global level not seen in 100 years is baffling to me. 
And it gets worse from there. 
French President Macron talked more than twice as long as President Xi, and even more during the press conference. EU President Ursula von der Leyen's just issued threats .... Ursula von der Leyen warns China not to send arms to Russia (The Guardian). 
The media optics showed both European leaders doing a lot of talking, but were they listening? My gut says no. 
But what was really telling is that every-time Macron brought up Ukraine, you can tell by President Xi's sighs that he wanted to discuss other issues.]]></summary>

Any attempt by China to forcefully change the status quo with Taiwan would hit "quite literally every country on earth," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned in an interview with Euronews in which he also made clear his country does not seek a direct confrontation with Beijing. 
China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has vowed to reunite the democratic island with the mainland, a goal that Western countries interpret as a coded language for a possible full-scale military intervention sometime in the future.

Politico:  China is ghosting the United States

 
Beijing has effectively frozen high level bilateral diplomatic contact in the wake of the Chinese spy balloon incident in February. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken wants to reschedule his date with China. Beijing is giving him the cold shoulder. 
 The Biden administration called off Blinken’s planned trip to Beijing in February after a Chinese spy balloon traversed U.S. skies, but has since been trying to restart high-level talks. That includes rescheduling the Blinken visit, and setting up other trips by top U.S. officials and a phone call between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a current U.S. official and a former State Department official said. 
But China is rebuffing the U.S. efforts, the people said, and its willingness to fully engage may hinge on the drama around Wednesday’s meeting in California between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy .

Seventy-one Chinese military aircraft crossed the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait on Saturday as China began drills around Taiwan in anger at President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The three-day drills, announced the day after Tsai returned from the United States, had been widely expected after Beijing condemned her Wednesday meeting with Speaker Kevin McCarthy in Los Angeles.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan’s government strongly objects to China’s claims.

Ukraine has not acknowledged any Russian takeover of Bakhmut 
Russian forces are threatening a key supply route for Ukrainian troops and have "likely" seized the center of Bakhmut after more than six months of brutal fighting over the town, the U.K. defense ministry said Friday. 
Russian troops, largely led by Wagner mercenary forces, have been attempting to encircle the town to pinch it from the north and south, and on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would pull their forces from the area if that threat became too great. 

"In recent days, Russian forces have regained some momentum in the battle for Bakhmut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a further attempt to rein in increasing numbers of women defying the compulsory dress code, Iranian authorities are installing cameras in public places and thoroughfares to identify and penalize unveiled women, the police announced on Saturday.
After they have been identified, violators will receive “warning text messages as to the consequences”, police said in a statement.
The move is aimed at “preventing resistance against the hijab law,” said the statement, carried by the judiciary’s Mizan news agency and other state media, adding that such resistance tarnishes the country’s spiritual image and spreads insecurity.
A growing number of Iranian women have been ditching their veils since the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in the custody of the morality police last September. Mahsa Amini had been detained for allegedly violating the hijab rule. Security forces violently put down the revolt.
Still, risking arrest for defying the obligatory dress code, women are still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country. Videos of unveiled women resisting the morality police have flooded social media.
Saturday's police statement called on owners of businesses to “seriously monitor the observance of societal norms with their diligent inspections”.
Under Iran's Islamic sharia law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes to disguise their figures. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest.
Describing the veil as "one of the civilizational foundations of the Iranian nation" and “one of the practical principles of the Islamic Republic,” an Interior Ministry statement said on March 30 that there would be no retreat on the issue.
It urged citizens to confront unveiled women. Such directives have in past decades emboldened hardliners to attack women. Last week a viral video showed a man throwing yoghurt at two unveiled women in a shop.

A new report from the National Security Council largely blamed former President Donald Trump's administration for the breakdown that occurred after U.S. troops withdrew. 
WASHINGTON — The White House released a report Thursday about the decisions made regarding the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, including the bombing at the Kabul airport that killed 13 U.S. service members. 
The 12-page report by the National Security Council summarizes the administration's assessment of the withdrawal and largely blames former President Donald Trump's administration for the chaos that unfolded as U.S. troops were leaving and as Americans and Afghans evacuated from the country. 
The Taliban took over the government and have remained in power.

"President Biden’s choices for how to execute a withdrawal from Afghanistan were severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor," the report said.

WNU Editor: I live in the Canadian province of Quebec, and we experienced an ice-storm and massive power black-out on Wednesday .... Quebec ice storm: Hydro reconnections, debris cleanup will take all weekend (Montreal Gazette). My area was particularly hard hit .... Hundreds of thousands still without power in Quebec following ice storm (CTV News). 
 I had confidence that the power would be restored quickly. But I was wrong. It was restored only a few minutes ago. 
At my home in Montreal I have a fireplace, candles, a lot of prepper stuff, food, essentials, etc.. The error that I made is that my gas/propane and solar generators are at my chalet, not at my home in Montreal. 
But I was not in a rush to leave my home in Montreal and grab my generator and bring it back to Montreal or to stay up north. 
Took the time to chill, relax, and catch up on some badly needed sleep. 
I was planning to drive to my chalet this evening, but the power came back on. 
Sighhh .... My two day break has come to an end. 
I have a lot of news to catch up on and a lot of emails to respond to. 

Give me a few hours, and I will be back to blogging.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, freed from a US jail last year, on Friday urged US ex-president Donald Trump to seek refuge in Russia as his life was "in peril".
Bout, also known as the "Merchant of Death", was swapped for US basketball star Britney Griner in a high-profile prisoner exchange between Moscow and Washington in December.
"I believe your life is in peril," Bout wrote in a telegram sent to Trump and shown to the press in Moscow.
"The Biden administration will not stop just by dragging you through the court/prison industrial complex," he said, referring to Trump's successor Joe Biden.
"They would sooner end your life than let you stand in their way."
Bout told Trump, whom he has long admired, that he would find a "safe haven and from here you can lead the fight for the American people."
Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in a US prison when he was swapped for Griner. He has since joined a Russian nationalist party.
Accused of arming rebels in some of the world's bloodiest conflicts, Bout was arrested in Thailand in a US sting operation in 2008, extradited to the United States and sentenced in 2012.
Washington and Moscow have in recent years held several prisoner exchanges.
There are still several Americans held in Russia.
Last week, Russia arrested US journalist Evan Gershkovich and charged him with espionage, provoking an international outcry.
Washington has called the charges against him "ridiculous."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin had an awkward moment when he finished a speech and was met by silence and no applause, Newsweek reported. 
The moment, shared online by his critics, occurred on Wednesday at the Grand Kremlin Palace during a ceremony to present diplomatic credentials to 17 newly-appointed foreign ambassadors.
"In his speech, Putin singled out the new United States and European Union ambassadors, and said they were responsible for a breakdown in relations with Russia following his decision to invade Ukraine last February," Newsweek's report stated. "Addressing new U.S. ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, Putin indicated that U.S. support for a Ukraine revolution in 2014 'ultimately led to today's Ukrainian crisis.'" 
At the end of the speech, Putin's eyes scanned the room, seemingly waiting for applause which never came.

"No one applauded Putin after he finished his speech at the ceremony of ambassadors presenting their credentials in the Kremlin," Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, wrote in a tweet that included the video. "Putin waited for applause as he finished talking but none came."
"This is a delicious moment. Putin clearly expected a polite applause, but he received none. The ambassadors—some having been scolded—expected at least a hand shake, and they got none," Swedish economist Anders Åslund wrote on Twitter. "Just shows that no need to maintain any embassies or ambassadors in Moscow. Go home!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moscow has formally charged US journalist Evan Gershkovich with espionage, Russian news agencies reported Friday, adding that he had denied the accusations.
The arrest of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich prompted an outcry from media outlets and rights groups, as well as government officials in Washington.
"FSB investigators charged Gershkovich with espionage in the interests of his country," Russian state-run agency TASS said, citing a law enforcement source.
"He categorically denied all accusations and stated that he was engaged in journalistic activities in Russia," TASS said.
Gershkovich's arrest is seen as a serious escalation of Moscow's crackdown on the media.
His publication, one of the most prestigious in the United States, "vehemently denies the allegations" against its "trusted and dedicated reporter".
The case has been classified as secret, limiting the amount of information available.
His arrest also comes as Moscow's relationship with Washington has been severely downgraded because of the Ukraine offensive.
Washington has long accused Moscow of arbitrarily arresting Americans in order to secure the release of detained Russians.
US President Joe Biden called for Gershkovich's release on Friday, the White House calling the accusations against him "ridiculous".
Russia said on Thursday it was "pointless" to try to pressure Moscow over the case.

The billionaire, a larger-than-life figure who has dominated Italian public life for decades, was admitted Wednesday to the intensive care cardiac unit at Milan's San Raffaele Hospital.
On Friday, the Berlusconi-owned newspaper, Il Giornale, ran a front-page photo of a younger, beaming "Cavaliere" from a past election campaign, with the headline, "I won't give in."
"It's tough, but I'll make it this time too," Berlusconi was quoted as telling the newspaper from his hospital bed.

Smoke from forest fires and farmers burning crop stubble has blanketed the popular tourist destination in recent weeks.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha held video talks with the leaders of neighboring Myanmar and Laos to discuss the problem, which affects large areas of southeast Asia every year.
Thailand has been choking on heavy air pollution since the start of the year, caused in part by seasonal agricultural burning.
Nearly two million people have needed hospital treatment for respiratory conditions caused by air pollution this year, according to the public health ministry.

Mount Everest's main expedition season is about to begin, and yet planned climbs are being undermined by delays in the transport of supplies for mountaineers.
Helicopters are currently only flying large items of equipment - such as large tents and tables - to the base camp of the world's highest mountain on the instructions of the local government.
Food, ropes, gas for cooking and medical equipment, for example, will be carried up by local porters or on animals, Tashi Lhamu Sherpa, the deputy mayor of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality, told dpa ahead of the start of climbing season in April.

Thomas Bangalter, formerly one-half of electronic music duo Daft Punk, said this week that his fear of artificial intelligence was a factor in why the group split in 2021.
Bangalter reflected on the duo's fictional persona in a recent interview with BBC News, saying that he always felt the group's thesis was about making sure there is an absolute line "between humanity and technology."
"It was an exploration, I would say, starting with the machines and going away from them," he said. "I love technology as a tool [but] I'm somehow terrified of the nature of the relationship between the machines and ours…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - U.S. agents arrested a retired Salvadoran military officer this week on charges of participating in a brutal massacre of civilians during El Salvador's grinding civil war in the 1980s, according to a statement on Thursday.
Agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Roberto Garay on Tuesday in the state of New Jersey, the agency said.
Garay served as section commander of a special military unit known as the Atlacatl Battalion from 1981 to 1985.
Retired Salvadoran general Juan Rafael Bustillo acknowledged in 2020 that Atlacatl was responsible for the notorious 1981 El Mozote massacre, in which more than 1,000 villagers, mostly women and children, were slaughtered.
The battalion carried out extrajudicial executions at El Mozote, as well as in three other massacres in which "hundreds of noncombatant civilians" were killed, ICE said.
Garay then "willfully" misrepresented his involvement in the massacre from an immigration application he had submitted, according to the statement.
Reuters was not immediately able to locate Garay's lawyer.
One of several bloody Central American conflicts linked to the Cold War, El Salvador's 1980-1992 civil war pitted the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels against the army of the U.S.-backed right-wing government.
The war left some 75,000 dead and another 8,000 missing.
Touting the agency's investigation team that aims to hold accused war criminals accountable, ICE stressed that individuals like Garay must be investigated, prosecuted and expelled from the United States.
"Individuals who have committed atrocities overseas will not find safe haven in the United States," Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security John K. Tien said in the statement.

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) -Israel's military hit sites in Lebanon and Gaza early on Friday, in retaliation for rocket attacks it blamed on the Islamist group Hamas, as tensions following police raids this week on the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem threatened to spiral out of control.
Loud blasts rocked different areas of Gaza, as Israel said its jets hit 10 targets including tunnels and weapons manufacturing and development sites of Hamas, which controls the blockaded southern coastal strip.
At around 4.00 a.m., the military said it had also struck three Hamas infrastructure targets in southern Lebanon, where residents around the area of the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern city of Tyre reported three loud blasts.

Radio Free Europe translated the recent interview with Gleb Karakulov, saying he "simply could not be in the service of this president."
“Our president has become a war criminal,” he said. “It’s time to end this war and stop being silent.”
It isn't a recent defection, Karakulov fled in October 2022, and has been in hiding. Karakulov was a captain in the Federal Protection Service before defecting to the west.
In the new interview, Karakulov said that he worked as an engineer in a division that gave secret communications to Putin. The division…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-06T17:03:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protesters started a fire at one of French President Emmanuel Macron's favorite restaurants in Paris on Thursday during clashes with riot police at the upmarket left-bank brasserie.
Staff at La Rotonde in the Montparnasse area of the city were forced to put out flames on the awning of the restaurant where Macron held a victory party during his successful 2017 election bid.
An AFP journalist saw a group of men dressed in black fire fireworks and throw stones in the direction of the eatery.
The fire was caused by a flare thrown on to the fabric awning, with firefighters needed to extinguish it.
Ranks of riot police formed to protect the business on the 11th day of national protests and strikes against Macron's widely unpopular bid to increase the retirement age to 64 from 62.
The red velour sofas and soft lighting of La Rotonde, a Belle Epoque hang-out once frequented by Picasso, have long been a favorite of Macron and his wife Brigitte.
The former investment banker held strategy meetings there as he prepared his bid for the presidency in 2017 and has been known to eat there with his wife since winning power.
In a decision criticized as elitist by his opponents at the time, Macron used La Rotonde to host staff and political allies for a party after he topped the first round of voting in 2017.
The restaurant has been targeted before because of its association with the 45-year-old president.
In 2020, during violent anti-government protests by so-called "Yellow Vests", a suspected arson attack left its entrance damaged.
"When there are marches and so on, you hear people saying 'Death to the Rotonde, Death to Macron'," Gerard Tafanel, who owns the bistro with his brother Serge, told AFP at the time.
"It happens all the time: anonymous phone calls, people who enter in the middle of the day saying 'Death to Macron'."

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
