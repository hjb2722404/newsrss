Along with almost every other black woman of childbearing age I knew, I read the article and talked about it constantly. Trapped in the American narrative of individualism, I learned the same ineffectual lessons that Villarosa espoused in Essence: “to work within the medical system and get all you can out of it”, not to “challenge that system “but for” self-advocacy for fair treatment. I did all of this during my own pregnancy, with Landrum’s story in mind. I took prenatal vitamins religiously; I followed doctor’s orders even when they suggested I should lose weight during my pregnancy I hired a doula, found a doctor who looked like me, and chose a hospital with a reputation for low C-section rates.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent months, however, the housing market has begun to slow in response to rising interest rates.  Since March, the Bank of Canada has raised its key rate by 175 basis points — the equivalent of 1.75% — in an effort to contain inflation.  “You see some households taking a bit of a step back because they have to reposition themselves in the market,” Mercer said.  “They may need to find a cheaper house, a different location, or time to save more on a down payment.”
Mr Powell added: “We are on a break – things have changed a lot over the last month.”
The real estate board reported 7,283 sales in the Greater Toronto Area in May, down 39% from May 2021 and 9% from the previous month.  The overall average selling price for all property types was C$1.21 million ($962,000), down about 7% from the previous two months.
Both trends suggest a more balanced market, which should allow “a bit more bargaining power for people still active in the market,” Mercer said.
Toronto’s major central neighborhoods, including Rosedale, Lawrence Park and Forest Hill, remain highly competitive as they suffer from a chronic shortage of available housing, said Cailey Heaps, President and CEO of the Heaps Estrin team.  According to the Real Estate Board, a detached house in the city currently averages just under C$2 million ($1.59 million), while a condo averages around C800,000 ($635,000). .
Additionally, the luxury market in general continues to perform “exceptionally well”, Ms. Heaps said.  “Buyers understand the scarcity of the product they are looking for.”
In Port Hope, the average selling price for the 38 homes sold in April and May was 909,000 Canadian ($723,000), up 28% from a year ago, according to Zolo, a classifieds site. real estate.

Imagine a towering, unmistakable redhead, 6ft 11in, boarding the T, as it is known in Boston, at Harvard Station.  Walton lived nearby during the Celtics’ 1985-86 championship season and in 1986-87 when they lost in the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers.
“Red line to green line to old garden,” he said.  “And with a car packed with crazy fans banging on the walls and the ceiling, shaking the car, chanting, ‘Here we go Celtics, here we go!’  ”
In a recent phone interview, Walton added that after six years of injury with the dysfunctional, Donald Sterling-owned Clippers of San Diego and Los Angeles, thes…]]></summary>

The U.N. atomic agency cameras are part of an inspections regime that Iran agreed to under the 2015 nuclear deal. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal. 
Iran says it has turned off two U.N. cameras monitoring its nuclear work, just as the United States and European governments were poised to rebuke Tehran over the regime’s failure to cooperate with an international probe of its nuclear program. 
The move cast fresh doubts on efforts to restore a 2015 nuclear deal designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and underscored rising tensions between Tehran and Washington. 
Iran announced the step through state television and other media outlets, saying two cameras from the International Atomic Energy Agency had been deactivated, but did not specify which nuclear site was affected or offer further details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: The above chart shows the countries that are most dependent on wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine. This is why I am not surprised that the UN is now leading intense negotiations with Russia to unblock Ukrainian ports and release tens of millions of tonnes of grain to avert a global food crisis. 
In the above graph I noticed that Turkey gets 90% of its grains from Russia and Ukraine. I guess that explains why Turkey is doing everything in its power to get Russia and Ukraine to cooperate on resuming grain exports .... Turkey struggles to push Russia, Ukraine into grain deal to avert food crisis (Reuters), and why Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is in Turkey ....  Russia open to Ukraine grain exports but demands conditions (AP). More here .... Turkey, Russia discuss efforts to restart Ukrainian grain exports (Al Jazeera). 
Unfortunately the talks are not succeeding .... No Progress at Russia-Turkey Talks on Ukraine Grain Exports (Moscow Times/AFP). 
A prediction. 
I expect Turkish President Erdogan is going to try and cultivate better ties with Putin. He sees the EU is in a panic over the Russia - Ukraine war ....

This situation may also explain Erdogan's objections to Sweden and Finland from joining NATO. He wants to be on the winning side, and he certainly does not want to jeopardize grain shipments from Russia that his country is completely dependent on.

(Bloomberg) -- Developing nations are suffering the biggest hit from this year’s oil shock. Many are dependent on imported fuel and are being crushed by a combination of high international prices, weak currencies and competition from rich nations whose economies are rebounding from the pandemic.

The Summit of the Americas — an event bringing together leaders of countries from Chile to Canada this week — was supposed to be a chance for the White House to demonstrate its leadership on big regional issues such as migration, climate change and recovering from the pandemic. 
But the agenda has been overshadowed by who won't be at the table. Several leaders, including Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, turned down the chance to meet with President Biden in Los Angeles.

WNU Editor: Mexico's no-show is embarrassing. Brazil making demands before agreeing to go to the summit is not surprising (link here). So much for the White House trying to demonstrate its leadership on big regional issues such as migration, economic development, climate change and recovering from the pandemic.

        <updated>2022-06-08T14:54:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This restriction is unlikely to limit Rob Walton, Greg Penner and their families.  Walton, 77, is the oldest child of Walmart co-founder Helen and Sam Walton.  Rob Walton was president of Walmart from 1992 to 2015. His cousin is Ann Walton, niece of Sam Walton and wife of E.  Stanley Kroenke, owner of the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, NBA’s Denver Nuggets, NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and Premier League’s Arsenal FC, among other teams.
Penner is married to Rob Walton’s daughter, Carrie, and has been president of Walmart since 2015. 
Walton-Penner’s offer, if approved, would end nearly four decades of Bowlen family ownership.  The Broncos joined the AFL in 1960 and were dismal on the field for their first decade and a half, although they were popular with fans in the Rocky Mountain states.  But after Bowlen bought the club in 1984, the Broncos had 21 winning seasons, 13 division titles, nine conference championship berths and seven Super Bowl appearances.
His failing memory, Bowlen retired from team management in 2014, and left several administrators, including Ellis, to oversee the franchise.  The administrators were tasked with deciding which of his children should become the majority owner – or whether the franchise should be sold, if they thought it was in the best interests of the family.
Beth Bowlen, Bowlen’s second daughter from his first marriage, worked at the club and was interested in becoming the main owner.  But she left the team several years ago.
Brittany Bowlen, a daughter from Bowlen’s second marriage, was named as a potential replacement.  The seven Bowlen children could not come to an agreement on who should take charge, so the team was put up for auction.
Now another family, this time with even richer pockets, is likely to take over.

Iga Swiatek claimed her second French Open title on Saturday, extending her winning streak to 35 games by beating Coco Gauff, 6-1, 6-3.
In Sunday’s men’s final, Rafael Nadal is in the hunt for his 14th French Open singles title against No. 8 seed Casper Ruud, the first Norwegian to reach a Grand Prix singles final. Slam.
In the end, both matches will have attracted massive and nearly equal public attention, but women’s tennis has yet to engage in a fight for a level playing field.  We’ve seen this play out again on red clay at Roland Garros over the past two weeks (more on that later).  Yet professional tennis sets the standard for popularity and viability in women’s sports – and it’s not even close.

Both have won three Manager of the Year awards and, if things continue, they would also be strong contenders for this year’s vote.
But before they became dugout peers and quick friends, Mets manager Buck Showalter and his San Diego Padres counterpart Bob Melvin shared a moment together under different circumstances.  He arrived at Yankee Stadium in 1994, when Showalter, then 37, was a third-year manager guiding the Yankees under owner George Steinbrenner.  Melvin, who was 32 at the time, was an aging receiver in his final season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ANAHEIM, Calif. — Joe Maddon has become the latest Angels coach to fail to deliver on team owner Arte Moreno’s vision of achieving glory with Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani.  He was fired Tuesday afternoon.
The move came after the Angels lost 12 straight games, a streak that reached 13 with a 6-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night.
The Angels went from a 24-14 record on May 16, when they tied for first place in the American League West with the Houston Astros, to a 27-30 mark and a 9.5 game deficit in the division.  With Tuesday’s loss in extra innings, Los Angeles set a franchise record for its longest single-season losing streak, surpassing a 12-game streak since 1988.
Prior to the match, Phil Nevin, previously the team’s third baseman coach, had taken over as caretaker manager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scrutiny is baffling for Ms Young, 33, who recalled how after the Parkland shooting she brought a leather belt to put in her classroom first aid kit in case she needed a tourniquet for a pupil.
“It’s literally entrusted to their life,” she said, “but not entrusted with choosing the program.”
Teachers in public schools earn an average of about $65,000 per year and were among the most trusted professionals, alongside nurses, doctors, soldiers and scientists.  But as schools closed and the social fabric frayed during the pandemic, trust in teachers has declined.
For some, the competing pressures were enough to drive them away.
“I needed a change,” said Kathy Macken, 62, a math and science teacher in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas, who quit the classroom after 19 to do intensive tutoring with smaller groups of students.
After being out of school earlier in the pandemic, her fifth graders returned this year in dire need.  Even when she tried to help them academically, Ms. Macken said, she spent much of her time trying to keep them calm and focused: Take out a pencil.  Write your homework in your diary.  Please no iPads during story time.
She had to cut back on a favorite science project — where students build terrariums to take home — because she didn’t have time.
And in the last week of school, a lockdown interrupted an outdoor field day.  Amid the fierce struggle and bouncy house fun, the students were shoved inside.  Ms Macken huddled with her students on the floor of her dark classroom while police investigated a report of a teenager walking down the street with a gun.

   Telesur: NATO Won't Offer Nuclear Guarantees to Russia 
According to the statements made by the deputy head of the US-led alliance, NATO will not offer any nuclear guarantees for Russia. 
NATO's Deputy Secretary-General Camille Grand said that the US-led alliance has no plans to grant any guarantees to Russian regarding the deployment of nuclear weapons on the territories of its two prospective members, referring to Finland and Sweden. 
NATO's official said that "every country is free in the nuclear field to deploy or not to deploy such weapons. We are not talking about setting up some principle restrictions on the possible actions of the alliance," the NATO official told Swiss broadcaster RTS in an interview published on Tuesday.

European unity over the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is proving difficult to maintain in the face of the war’s impact on inflation and living standards across the continent, Estonia’s prime minister has said. 
Kaja Kallas also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for trying to provide Vladimir Putin with a diplomatic way out of the conflict, saying the only effect was to give the Russian leader the belief that he will not be isolated or face justice for his army’s war crimes.

Ukraine will fight to recover all its territory that has been occupied by Russian forces, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on June 7 as Ukrainian forces struggled to hold on to the eastern city of Syevyerodonetsk. 
Ukrainian military forces reported that during the day in Donetsk and Luhansk regions Russian troops fired on more than 16 settlements, killing one civilian and injuring six. 
Ukrainian defenders repulsed 11 enemy attacks, and fighting was still going on at two locations, the military said. Ukrainian forces claimed to have destroyed three Russian tanks, five artillery systems, several vehicles, and three ammunition depots.

The World Bank has slashed its global growth forecast by nearly a third for 2022, warning that the risk of 1970s-style 'stagflation' is increasing and saying many countries now face recession. 
'The danger of stagflation is considerable today,' World Bank President David Malpass wrote in the foreword to Tuesday's report, which cut global growth projections to 2.9 percent for 2022.

Born in Shropshire in 1913, Pym began writing early, but had her true intellectual awakening at Oxford, where she met companions who would become not only lifelong friends but role models for her characters.  Popular but not exactly pretty, she fell frequently and painfully in love.  It’s a pattern that will repeat itself throughout Pym’s life.  She had a taste for bad men: unworthy, unavailable or homosexual, sometimes all of that.  She could sacrifice herself to the point of masochism, subsist on crumbs of affection – not only did she work as a secretary for one of them, she paid “30 shillings a week and a few caresses”, but in doing so she found a half-finished love poem he had written to his future (first) wife, written, as Byrne tells us, …]]></summary>

LVIV, Ukraine – “I'll put a bag over your head, lead you into the basement, and leave you there. It's flooded and full of obstacles... and rats,” says a large Ukrainian trainer who goes by the callsign “Charon.” “It'll also be pitch-black. Your objective is to make it out. Be ready for me to throw simulated grenades at you."

The show opened to huge acclaim and was a major hit, but it suffered a double whammy from the coronavirus pandemic and a poorly received film adaptation, and has been limp at the box office in recent months.

Not just because, as Lady Macbeth, she briefly wears a gold metallic dress in the otherwise fairly casual staging of Sam Gold’s “Macbeth” at the Longacre Theatre.  But it’s more because she infuses her character and her marriage to Macbeth (Daniel Craig) with such intensity, urgency and vitality that I missed her when she came to her inevitable end.
Negga was appointed for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play, which recognizes both her powerful stage presence and the gender parity that Gold’s revival sought to achieve.  “Like a wildcat she can appear quicksilver and weightless or, when enraged, menacing and bristling and twice her size,” Jesse Green wrote of Negga’s performance in a review in The Times.

His wife, Ruby Jean Seals, said the cause was an unspecified “ongoing chronic illness”.
Mr. Seals and his musical partner, Dash Crofts, were still teenagers when they were asked to join an instrumental group, the Champs, who had had a No. 1 hit in 1958 with “Tequila”.  By the mid-1960s, they had grown tired of the band and the loud, sometimes angry strains that infused the hard rock of the era.
Followers of the Bahá’í Faith, they sought to create calmer music, blending folk, bluegrass, country and jazz influences and delivering their lyrics in close harmony.

Fresh out of a meeting with President Biden, McConaughey echoed the president’s call for thorough background checks on gun buyers, new ‘red flag’ laws and restrictions over the purchase of AR-15 rifles like the one used to kill 19 children and two teachers at a primary school in Uvalde last month.

(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Kyiv would not settle for a battlefield stalemate with Russia and that it aimed to regain control of all its territory occupied by Moscow. 
"We have already lost too many people to simply cede our territory," he said by video link at an event hosted by FT Live, in which he added that a stalemate was "not an option" for Kyiv. 
"We have to achieve a full deoccupation of our entire territory," Zelenskiy said.  Kyiv has previously said that Russian forces now occupy about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including swathes of its east and south.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday there are "credible reports" that Russia is "pilfering" Ukraine's grain exports to sell for profit. 
Speaking during a virtual roundtable with philanthropies, non-governmental organizations and private sector entities, Blinken said the alleged theft was part of broader Russian actions during its war in Ukraine that have hit Ukraine's ability to export its wheat crop and worsened a global food security crisis.

WNU Editor: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's evidence of this theft comes from s main stream media sources (link here). The problem with these claims is that the warm water port at Sevastopol has always been used to move grains.
