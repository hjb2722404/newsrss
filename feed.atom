19FortyFive: There Is No Military Path for Ukraine To ‘Defeat’ Russia 
The Tide of Battle – and Mounting Casualties – Turning Against Ukraine – Since it became evident a few weeks into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that Moscow’s troops were stopped cold outside of Kyiv, there has been a near-universal belief in the West that Ukraine would eventually win. All that was needed, many pundits claimed, was to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces sufficient numbers of weapons and ammunition. As the war now grinds towards the four-month mark, it is becoming painfully evident that the odds are stacked in Russia’s favor. 
Militarily speaking, there is no rational path through which Ukraine will ever win its war. Without a course correction – and soon – Kyiv itself may not ultimately be safe.    
Read more ....   
WNU Editor: You know the situation is deteriorating fast when Ukraine President Zelensky's top adviser is making an urgent request to NATO at their meeting this Wednesday for these weapons (see tweet below). 
Ukraine had most of these weapons before the war, and to me this adviser is admitting that they now need to be replaced because most have been lost and destroyed. A testament to how brutal this war is becoming. 
I am also being told by one source in Ukraine that I trust that the Ukrainian military losses are not 100 - 200 soldiers a day, but two to three times that. If true, these numbers are staggering, and you cannot sustain a war with that type of losses, let alone mounting a counter-offensive to defeat the Russian military. 

Being straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity:
 1000 howitzers caliber 155 mm;
 300 MLRS;
 500 tanks;
 2000 armored vehicles;
 1000 drones.
Contact Group of Defense Ministers meeting is held in #Brussels on June 15. We are waiting for a decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Image credit: SpaceX)  SpaceX: SpaceX beating Russian jamming attack was ‘eyewatering’: DoD official  
“The way that Starlink was able to upgrade when a threat showed up, we need to be able to have that ability," said Dave Tremper, the Pentagon's director of electronic warfare. "We have to be able to change our electromagnetic posture, to be able to change very dynamically what we're trying to do without losing capability along the way.”  
WASHINGTON: The US military’s electronic warfare enterprise needs to take a page from SpaceX when it comes to responding to new threats, the Pentagon’s director for electromagnetic warfare said today.  After SpaceX sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine in February in an apparent effort to help Ukraine maintain its internet connection amid war with Russia, SpaceX founder Elon Musk claimed that Russia had jammed Starlink terminals in the country for hours at a time. 
After a software update, Starlink was operating normally, said Musk, who added on March 25 that the constellation had “resisted all hacking & jamming attempts” in Ukraine.

(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin paid tribute on Thursday to Tsar Peter the Great on the 350th anniversary of his birth, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands. 
"Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. 
He did not take anything from them, he returned (what was Russia's)," Putin said after a visiting an exhibition dedicated to the tsar. 
 In televised comments on day 106 of his war in Ukraine, he compared Peter's campaign with the task facing Russia today.

Ukrainian News: Ukraine might receive first howitzers from Germany around June 22 – Ambassador 
Ukraine can receive Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers from Germany around June 22. 
Also, the country has to receive German self-propelled anti-aircraft guns Gepard. 
This was announced by Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrii Melnyk.

WNU editor: I do not think this June 22 delivery date was deliberately planned to coincide with the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Germany does not really have its act-together when it comes to supplying Ukraine with weapons .... Germany Never Gave Fixed Date on Weapons Delivery, Says Govt Spokesperson (Reuters). 
But June 22 is a day that is remembered by most Russians, and it is bringing back memories that are not pleasant. 
When I was a kid my father told me on a June 22 day why that date was important to him. The start of the war changed his life and the life of everyone he knew in 1941. I still remember the look that he had. It is the same look that my friends in New York City have when they remember 9/11.]]></summary>

RFE: Interview: Edward Luttwak, A Military Adviser To Presidents, Explains How The Ukraine War Began And How It Might End 
Edward Luttwak is among modern times' most sought-after military strategists, advising the Pentagon, presidents, and prime ministers around the world. He's also among their most controversial. Luttwak's analyses and conclusions are often described as being blunt, unequivocal, counterintuitive, and sometimes jarringly cynical. 
A polyglot American born to Jewish parents in World War II Romania and raised in Italy and England, he is the author of seminal books like Strategy: The Logic Of War And Peace and The Grand Strategy Of The Soviet Union as well as more than a dozen others. But he is best known for his 1968 book Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook, which is required reading at some war colleges.

WNU Editor: I have been following Edward Luttwack since the 1980s. His analysis is usually spot on. And while I do not think his confidence in Ukraine salvaging a "victory" in this war is realistic, the above interview is my must read post for today.]]></summary>

The Navy’s aviation community will undergo a “safety pause” Monday in the wake of multiple fatal flight mishaps in less than two weeks. 
During the pause, units will review risk-management practices and train “on threat and error-management processes,” according to a Naval Air Forces statement. 
“In order to maintain the readiness of our force, we must ensure the safety of our people remains one of our top priorities,” the command statement said. 
Deployed units will conduct the pause at the earliest possible time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The opening hearing of the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol made it clear why Fox News split from every other major news network by refusing broadcast the audience during prime time.
This was so the network could continue to mislead its viewers about what happened on January 6, 2021.
ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, CNN and MSNBC broadcast the entire two-hour hearing live.  Fox News didn’t, pushing its anchors Bret Bayer and Martha MacCallum at Fox Business, while its opinion leaders aired counter-programming laden with misrepresentations and conspiracy theories about the riot.
The hearing began at 8 p.m., at the start of At Tucker Carlson Fox News broadcast.  Carlson continued to downplay the bloody riot on his show, as he has for more than a year, callin…]]></summary>

She pulled out an old box of Christmas lights to wrap around the railing.  She looked at me with beaming eyes as she plugged them in and told me that my ex-partner had raved about me a few weeks earlier.

“She said she had never felt more loved and cared for than when she was with a black woman.”

I looked up from where I was sitting and wondered if I was going to end the night in a flurry of tipsy text messages reminding all my former lovers and friends that I’m not binary.  Instead, I poured myself more wine and drank like it wasn’t a weekday.

The mass movement coincided with a recent meeting in Los Angeles of leaders from the Western Hemisphere, where migration was a key focus.
Although migrant caravans have become a common occurrence and are usually dispersed by authorities long before they reach the southern border of the United States, the latest march of some 6,000 people walking along Mexican highways has drawn significant international attention.

The Guardian: Ukraine’s high casualty rate could bring war to tipping point 
Analysis: Kyiv’s fighting strength is stretched, yet Russia could now benefit from a pause in fighting 
Any way you count it, the figures are stark: Ukrainian casualties are running at a rate of somewhere between 6oo and 1,000 a day. One presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told the Guardian this week it was 150 killed and 800 wounded daily; another, Mykhaylo Podolyak, told the BBC that 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops a day were being killed. 
It represents an extraordinary loss of human life and capacity for the defenders, embroiled in a defence of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk that this week turned into a losing battle. Yet the city was also arguably a place that Ukraine could have retreated from to the more defensible Lysychansk, across the Siverski Donets River, the sort of defensive situation that Ukraine has fared far better in.

“The West has the right to give Ukraine nuclear warheads so that it could protect its independence,” Sikorski told Ukraine’s Espreso TV on Saturday.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's prime minister pledged to lead a minority government on Wednesday as the populist ITN party quit the government over disagreements on budget spending and whether Bulgaria should back North Macedonia's European Union accession. 
Kiril Petkov said he was "optimistic" his centrist PP party and its two remaining coalition partners could still deliver on pledges to uproot widespread corruption in the EU's poorest member state after losing their parliamentary majority. 
But analysts say the rift is likely to bring fresh instability just as the Ukraine war causes inflation to surge. Petkov's government only took office in December after a prolonged political crisis.

Mr Marles met with General Wei Fenghe for more than hour on the sideline of the Shangri-La Defence Dialogue, marking the first time in three years the defence ministers of the two countries have met.

Lowy Institute Senior Fellow Richard McGregor says the meeting was “very interesting” as both Australia and China were willing to have a conversation.

He said before Mr Marles went to Singapore he said there was no meeting arranged so the occurrence of one shows both countries “decided it was about time to end the stand-off”.

“It’s important to remember though there’s no change in all the fundamental problems in the relationship, all that’s happening now is we’re talking about them,” he told Sky News Australia.

“In the case of the military that’s a good thing because it means we might be able to avoid the kind of incidents we had in the South China Sea a few months ago.”]]></summary>

This sound prompted families carrying bags of food, pots of coffee, soda coolers, grills, hookahs and many children into action, climbing iron ladders to get into the wagons. wooden train.

Warzone/The Drive: Israel Has Extended The Range Of Its F-35s: Report 
Reports in the Israeli media suggest that IAF F-35s have been enhanced to hit Iranian targets unrefueled and carry at least one new weapon. 
Recent reports in the Israeli media claim that the country has developed a means of extending the range of its F-35I Adir stealth jets, allegedly providing them with enough reach to hit targets in Iran without needing aerial refueling. The development has been announced together with the integration of a new, locally developed smart bomb for internal carriage in the F-35. These apparent upgrades to the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike capabilities come as the Israeli leadership announces a harder line against Tehran’s nuclear program, while the air force conducts exercises widely thought to be dress rehearsals for potential raids against Iran.

WNU Editor: Israel modified the external fuel tanks for the F-35. It will degrade its stealth capabilities, but it will make it possible for these jets to now strike Iran without being refueled.

This oft-told story was told again Thursday at the Joyce Theater, which Feld also helped found, with the return of Kids Dance, Ballet Tech’s performance troupe, in a recital for paying (and even critical) audiences.  He came in Feld’s recorded voice as part of “Eureka!”, a new work …]]></summary>

There was a lot to see: the electric chair from his 1974 black comedy, “Female Trouble,” in the hallway.  A birth certificate for Divine, the 300-pound transvestite who played the “dirtiest person alive” in “Pink Flamingos,” hangs in a basement room filled with memories.  The mimeographed poster for the 1966 premiere of “Roman Candles” pulled from a stack of boxes.

She was 65 years old.
Her husband, Edward Grinnan, said the cause was suicide.  He said she had battled depression as well as lupus.
Ms. Cruise was building a career on Broadway in the early 1980s when chance struck: she met the composer Angelo Badalamenti when they were working on a show together.


“I was in this country and western musical in the East Village,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1990. “I was a chorus girl with a big skirt and a big wig, singing way too loud. Angelo was doing the music for the show and we became fr…]]></summary>

The pair met in a hotel room in London, Knight said in a recent interview, and chatted for three hours about the show, which was based on the real Shelby family who operated in Birmingham, central London. England, in the shadow of the First World War.  “Peaky” reminded the rapper of how he got involved in gang culture in Los Angeles, Knight said.
“How the connection occurs between 1920s Birmingham and South Central, I don’t know,” said Knight, 62.  “I think you just get lucky with certain projects and that resonates with people.”

Bethanie Taylor, 27, mother of a five-month-old baby boy who lives in Springhill, Kansas, knows she loves the Little Sleepies.  “But I don’t know if I was brainwashed,” she said.
There’s a lot to like for a discerning parent: the material is hypoallergenic, antifungal, odor resistant and has natural UV protection.  Items come in thousands of patterns and designs, which the company releases weekly.  Instead of offering all of these options on the company’s website like most retailers do, Little Sleepies “drops” these baby pajamas at some point.
It’s like a size 12-18 month sleep set, it’s the latest pair of Nike sneakers.  “Stars & Stripes” pyjamas, perfect for the 4th of July, for example, became available …]]></summary>

Americans are facing more expensive food, fuel and housing, and some are seeking answers on what is causing the price spike, how long it could last and what can be done to fix it.
There are few easy answers or painless fixes when it comes to inflation, which has surged around the world as supply shortages collide with strong consumer demand.  It’s hard to predict how long today’s price spike will last, and the main tool to combat it is rising interest rates, which dampen inflation by slowing the economy – potentially sharply.

"Russian-American political dialogue is at an unprecedented low level. Trust is undermined, cooperation is collapsing even on issues of obvious mutual interest. Communication between the parties is limited today," Antonov said on the air of the Bolshaya Igra ("Big Game") show on Channel One, adding that the dialogue is "limited to the discussion of technical issues," Sputnik reported. 
The diplomat also said that the sides currently do not conduct a dialogue on the strategic stability and called the situation "wrong" as the "world expects concrete actions" from the US and Russia. 
Antonov added that he is "unaware" of any unofficial dialogue between Moscow and Washington.

WASHINGTON — Even before the start of the war in Ukraine, an international alliance to rally the world against a Russian invasion came together so quickly that President Biden later marveled at the “purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.” 
Now, with the conflict in its fourth month, U.S. officials are facing the disappointing reality that the powerful coalition of nations — stretching from North America across Europe and into East Asia — may not be enough to break the looming stalemate in Ukraine.

Summer gasoline is almost always more expensive as fuel demand takes off around Memorial Day weekend.  But this year, oil and refined fuel prices have risen to their highest levels in 14 years, largely due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions, and a rebound in energy consumption as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
The national average gasoline price on Saturday was $5.00, up 60 cents from a month ago.  A year ago gasoline was selling for $3.08, according to the AAA automobile club.  The national average is at its highest level since March, when it topped his previous record set in July 2008, when oil was trading at over $133…]]></summary>

Daily Mail: 'To say our country was on the right track would flagrantly depart from reality': Top Democrats say Biden should NOT run for re-election in 2024 
* Fifty top Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times said Joe Biden  should not run for re-election in 2024 president 
* Many were pessimistic about Biden's leaderships, which is marred with failures 
* Biden failed to pass his $1.8 trillion Build Back Better agenda and voting rights expansion bill, and faced backlash over the chaotic exit from Afghanistan 
* The administration continues to face challenges from record high gas prices and soaring inflation, and a possible end to the federal abortion rights 
* Many Democratic leaders also worry about the presidents age, who was the oldest man appointed to office at 78 last January 
* Democrats are also at a loss of who should take control of the party as Republicans are expected to rack up major victories in the coming midterms 
Top Democrats across the country said President Joe Biden should not run for re-election in 2024 as they expressed worries over his current leadership and age. 
Nearly all 50 Democratic officials interviewed by the New York Times feared a Biden re-election campaign would not help their party against Republicans, who are expected to make sweeping victories in the coming midterms. 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) member Steve Simeonidis, of Miami, said he was generally pessimistic about his party's leadership and called on Biden, 79, to let someone new take over in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With 44 million Medicare beneficiaries and an annual test costing around $1,000 a year, plus expensive scans and biopsies for those who test positive, the price could be substantial.
He and other critics warn the risks of triggering the tests are substantial.  As paradoxical as it may seem, finding cancers earlier could mean as many deaths, at the same time, as without early diagnosis.  Indeed, at least with current treatments, cancers meant to kill are not necessarily cured if caught early.
And there are other risks.  For example, some will test positive, but doctors will be unable to locate the cancer.  Others will be aggressively treated with surgery or chemotherapy for cancers that, if left alone, would not have grown and spread and may even be gone.
Dr. Beer acknowledges that a blood test for cancer “is not without risk or cost, and will not detect all cancers”.
But, he said, “I think there’s the promise of real impact.”
Other experts are worried.
Dr. Barnett Kramer, a member of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine and former director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute, worries that testing will go mainstream without ever showing it’s beneficial .  Once that happens, he said, “it’s hard to ring the bell.”
“Hopefully we’re not halfway to a nightmare,” Dr. Kramer said.
Damocles syndrome
When Susan Iorio Bell, 73, a nurse who lives in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, saw an ad on Facebook recruiting women her age for a cancer blood test study, she immediately signed up.  This aligned with his advocacy of preventive medicine and his belief in clinical trials.

Then a piece of the ceiling above the leak collapsed.  The super covered the hole with cardboard but never fixed the leak or the ceiling.  I called several times, and he always says “tomorrow” but never solves the problem.  I also called management twice and sent pictures.  The wall seems to be getting moldy.  The cardboard begins to crumble.  What should I do?
A: You can do lots of things.  Start by calling 311 to request an inspection at Department of Housing Preservation and Development.  An inspector would most likely issue a violation, which might not solve your problem immediately, but would create a paper trail of evidence.

The agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said Thursday it was update of its preliminary assessment from autopilot to technical analysis, a deeper level of scrutiny that is required before a recall can be ordered.
The analysis will examine whether the Autopilot fails to prevent drivers from diverting their attention from the road and engaging in other predictable and risky behaviors while using the system.

“We’ve had a ton of sightings,” said Maxine Montello, an official with the New York Maritime Rescue Center.  “It’s a glory to see stronger populations but also a worry because there’s increased overlap with humans and shared resources,” she said, particularly during the summer months when more and more tourists and pleasure craft ply the bustling waters.
The dolphin revival around metropolitan New York – which has the most developed coastline in the country – stands in stark contrast to the grim periods of disease and soaring death rates that have periodically plagued the wate…]]></summary>

The Russian federal space company, Roscosmos, announced his death.  Dmitry Rogozin, the company’s director, called Mr Ryumin’s death an “irreparable loss”, but did not say where he died or name the cause.
Mr Ryumin’s first mission, on Soyuz 25, was supposed to last 90 days, but ended after just two when the vehicle failed to dock with the Salyut 6 orbital space station.


During his next two missions, Mr. Ryumin and his teammates set space endurance records: 175 days with Vladimir Lyakhov on Soyuz 32 in 1979 and 185 days with Leonid Popov on Soyu…]]></summary>

It’s the final leg of a journey of thousands of miles, as the butterflies travel from their North American breeding grounds to their winter colonies, where they cover the fir trees.  Visitors who time their trips correctly may find the air so laden with monarchs that they can hear the flapping wings of butterflies.
“It’s a to-do list,” said Andrew Davis, an ecologist at the University of Georgia in Athens.  “Imagine being surrounded by billions of butterflies. It’s a magical experience.
It is also one that may not last.  In recent decades, the number of Monarchs overwintering in Mexico and overwintering sites in Southern California droppedwhich raises fears that the species is seriously threatened with ext…]]></summary>
