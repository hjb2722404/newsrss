        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian authorities said Monday they seized 2.3 tonnes of cocaine disguised as ceramic tiles destined for Turkey via a growing maritime route for illicit drugs.
The drug bust happened Friday at a warehouse at Peru's biggest port, El Callao, just outside the capital Lima, police said.
"This is the first incident that we know of (in which the cargo was in) Peruvian ports and its final destination was Turkey. Usually we are aware of ports in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and France," said El Callao's police chief, Colonel Luis Angel Bolanos.
At a press conference Monday, police displayed the cocaine, which had been fixed to rubber sheets to appear as hundreds of ceramic tiles packed in wooden boxes inside a shipping container.
Bolanos said the seized cocaine was valued at "at least $20 million."
The Andean nation seized a record 86.4 tonnes of drugs and illicit substances last year, 28 tonnes of which were cocaine hydrochloride, police data shows.
Peru and nearby Colombia are among the top global producers of cocaine and of the coca leaf it is made of, according to the United Nations.

   EurAsian Times: US Acquires ‘Critical’ Military Base Overlooking Taiwan & Claimed By China; Beijing Calls The Move ‘Provocative’ 
Amidst Chinese criticism mounting over the American role in the South China Sea, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr announced that four new military bases under a defense agreement with the US would be scattered across the country, including one in a province overlooking Taiwan. 
“There are four extra sites scattered around the Philippines — there are some in the North, there are some around Palawan, there is some further South,” Marcos told reporters on the sidelines of the Filipino army’s founding anniversary. 
The announcement comes after one of the most advanced fighter jets of the US Air Force, the F-22 Raptor, exercised with the Philippines Air Force (PAF) earlier this week, making it the first time the top-notch jet had visited the nation. 
The Filipino President further stated that his country and the US would reveal the locations of the bases soon, adding the sites would strengthen the country’s capabilities to protect the “eastern half” of its main island, Luzon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Euronews/AP: EU threatens more sanctions if Russia moves nukes to Belarus Access to the comments 
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus about allowing Russia to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory.
Borrell tweeted: “Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation & threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” 
In an interview on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move was triggered by Britain’s decision last week to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium. 
Tactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield. They have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles.

Update #1: EU Threatens More Sanctions If Russia Stations Tactical Nuclear Weapons In Belarus (Zero Hedge/Epoch Times)  
Update #2: EU will respond to Kremlin's nuclear blackmail with new sanctions - Borrell (Ukrinform)   
WNU Editor: There is not much left to sanction. This nuclear deployment to Belarus also tells me that any Western hope for regime change in Belarus is not going to happen. 
And as for Ukraine receiving depleted uranium shells that resulted in the Kremlin making the announcement of deploying tactical nuclear missiles to Belarus, those munitions are now on their way .... Depleted-uranium shells, the armour-busting munitions heading to Ukraine (France 24).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 16 people have died in a landslide triggered by months of heavy rainfall in the south of Ecuador, the government said on Monday.
The mudslide happened late on Sunday night, burying dozens of homes, injuring 16 people and affecting around 500, the Risk Management Secretariat (SNGR) said in a statement.
Ecuador President Guillermo Lasso said on Twitter that firefighters from neighboring areas had been deployed to the village of Alausi in Chimborazo province, around 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of the capital, "to attend to the affected citizens."
Images shared on local media showed dozens of rescuers and civilians trying to clear debris by hand in the dead of night with only torches for light in the mountainous region.
Authorities said they are looking for seven missing people.

Indonesia Expat: Indonesian Government to Launch the Domestic Credit Card 
President Joko Widodo’s statement that he prefers credit cards used by the government to be issued by domestic issuers rather than foreign companies has been met with positivity from Indonesia’s credit card issuers. 
Executive Director of the Indonesian Credit Card Association (AKKI), Steve Marta said that the government should encourage the use of government credit cards that utilise local issuers and public credit cards. 
“It’s not only government credit cards but I think we should also have local credit cards one day,” Marta told CNBC Indonesia on Thursday, 6th March 2023. 
Marta stated that the banking sector’s credit card issuers would also endorse this measure, citing security risks associated with credit cards issued overseas, as highlighted by Jokowi’s comments about US sanctions against Russia during the Ukraine conflict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Myanmar army chief vows to crush resistance in rare speech 
The pageantry of Myanmar's annual military parade did little to mask the sinister message - the country's armed forces won't stop fighting those opposing their rule, whatever the cost. 
A civil war has engulfed the country since a military coup in 2021. 
The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, and more than a million have been displaced. 
But General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, showed no signs of backing down in a rare speech. 
The regime, he said, would deal decisively with what he described as "acts of terror" by armed resistance groups. And, he added, countries which have condemned his coup - supporters of terror, he branded them - were wrong and should join the military in shaping its own form of democracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC/Reuters: Largest strike in decades brings Germany to a standstill 
* Airports and bus and train stations across Germany were at a standstill on Monday, causing disruption for millions at the start of the working week. 
* Employees are pressing for higher wages to blunt the effects of inflation, which reached 9.3% in February. 
* The Airports Association ADV estimated that 380,000 air passengers were affected. 
Airports and bus and train stations across Germany were at a standstill on Monday, causing disruption for millions at the start of the working week during one of the largest walkouts in decades as Europe’s biggest economy reels from inflation. 
The 24-hour strikes called by the Verdi trade union and railway and transport union EVG were the latest in months of industrial action which has hit major European economies as higher food and energy prices dent living standards. 
Terminals were largely deserted as airports, including two of Germany’s largest in Munich and Frankfurt, suspended flights, while rail services were cancelled by railway operator Deutsche Bahn (DBN.UL). Striking workers wearing yellow or red high-visibility jackets blew horns, sirens and whistles, held up banners and waved flags during protests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin is threatening to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in the allied nation of Belarus, and former President Donald Trump believes that this development is the fault of the United States.
Writing on his Truth Social platform, the former president warned of the dangers posed by Putin's nuclear saber-rattling, but he did not blame the Russian leader for behaving irresponsibly.
Instead, he pointed the finger entirely at the United States.
"Here we go!!! Just as I predicted, now we’re playing with the 'BIG STUFF,'" Trump wrote, referring to the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons. "The 'N' WORD is now being used, front and center. This situation was caused by us -- It’s what happens when you have incompetent people running your government. All I can say to you right now is, PRAY!"

Trump has repeatedly heaped praise upon Putin over the years, and he even gushed about Putin's "genius" decision to invade Ukraine last year.
Trump also infamously took Putin's side during a press conference in Helsinki in which he said he did not believe his own intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him win.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France 24: Macron holds crisis meeting as more France protests loom 
French President Emmanuel Macron summoned government ministers for a crisis meeting on Monday, as tensions ran high a day before another major round of strikes and protests against his pension reforms. 
Nearly two weeks after Macron rammed the new law through parliament using a special provision sidestepping any vote, unions have vowed no let-up in mass protests to get the government to back down. 
They have called for another big day of action on Tuesday, the 10th such mobilisation since protests started in mid-January against the controversial law, which includes raising the retirement age to 64 from 62.
Macron, whose approval ratings in opinion polls are at a low point, said last week he accepted the "unpopularity" that came with the reform. 
Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, meanwhile, said that while there was no plan to drop the legislation, she was ready for fresh dialogue with unions.

   Republic World:  Turkey Backs China's Peace Plan If It Creates 'foundation For Negotiation': Erdogan's Aide 
 "In order to neutralize the consequences of Mr Xi’s visit to Moscow, (Western countries) began to literally ignore this visit," Kalin said during the interview. 
Turkey will support China's peace plan for Ukraine if Beijing established a "foundation for negotiations," Erdogan's representative, Ibrahim Kalin, in an interview with the Turkish NTV channel. 
West ignored the Chinese 12-point peace plan in order "not to give credit of confidence to Beijing," he noted, adding that anti-Russian sanctions were also "poorly calculated" and only pushed China and Russia to strengthen ties.

Naval News: U.S. Navy Commences USS Connecticut (SSN 22) Repairs 
Naval News reached out to NAVSEA to ask the status of repairs on the Seawolf-class nuclear-powered attack submarine, USS Connecticut (SSN 22). The submarine hit a seamount in international waters in the INDO-PACOM area on October 2, 2021. According to a previous Naval News story on the Connecticut, repairs supposedly started in February 2023. 
In general, the U.S. Navy considers submarine operations “Classified Secret”. Therefore, information on submarine repairs remains elusive at best. A search of government contracting websites reveals no (detailed) information on the ordering of parts for the USS Connecticut as of March 2023.

WNU Editor: 16 months to start repairs on a critical US Navy submarine. This is just more evidence on the US Navy's lack of infrastructure to take care of its fleet.

The Army paused its new multi-million dollar advertising campaign Sunday after its featured actor was arrested the day before, officials said. 
Jonathan Majors, who stars as the on-screen narrator in the first wave of “Be All You Can Be” advertisements, faces charges of assault, strangulation and harassment, a New York Police Department official told Army Times. 
The police official said officers responded to a 911 call shortly after 11:00 a.m. at an apartment in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood, where they found Majors and a 30-year-old woman with injuries to her head and neck. Officers did a “preliminary investigation” and arrested the actor.

Cuba is holding elections Sunday to pick lawmakers at a time when the ruling communist party is struggling to keep a lid on public anger caused by rampant inflation, hunger and blackouts. 
The vote, decried as a sham by human rights groups, will pick 470 candidates who were pre-selected by the government to the powerful National Parliament for a five-year term. The system has allowed the Communist Party to control the parliament since its inception in 1976.

WNU Editor: The outcome of this Cuban election has already been determined. There are no opposition candidates on the ballot .... Cuba holds national elections with no opposition candidates (AP). 
I have always closely followed the news from Cuba. Been there many times, and I was always felt that if there is a country in the Caribbean that would succeed, it would be Cuba. But the system is now so rigged to benefit a few (I would estimate about 5% of the population), that the rest of the country (i.e. the other 95%) are exploited and abused.

KABUL (Reuters) - Sofia logs in to class on a laptop in Kabul for an online English course run by one of a growing number of educational institutes trying to reach Afghanistan's girls and women digitally in their homes.
But when the teacher calls on Sofia to read a passage her computer screen freezes.
"Can you hear me?" she asks repeatedly, checking her connection.
After a while, her computer stutters back to life.
"As usual," a fellow student equally frustrated with the poor communications sighs as the class gets going again.

The Swiss government was compelled to intervene to save Credit Suisse Group AG as the troubled bank wouldn’t have survived another day of trading amid a crisis of investor confidence, Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said. 
 “CS would not have survived Monday,” Keller-Sutter said in an interview with Zurich newspaper NZZ. “Without a solution, payment transactions with CS in Switzerland would have been significantly disrupted, possibly even collapsed.” 
The impact of a disorderly bankruptcy may have been as much as double Swiss economic output, the minister said, citing expert estimates. More broadly, “we should have expected a global financial crisis” as “the crash of CS would have sent other banks into the abyss.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On an otherwise typical morning, one very important component of village life appeared to be missing. The proud parish of just 600, woke to find all the ‘Eggs’ in its namesake street signs and notice boards had mysteriously disappeared. The ‘Welcome to Egginton’ signs bookending the village, now read ‘Welcome to …Inton’ leading to much head scratching from passers-by. As speculation grew, Egginton began to wonder who had hidden their eggs. In a cunning move, the unsuspecting residents were then given clues to a village location so Egginton could get its ‘Eggs’ back, as Cadbury revealed it was behind the amusing activity. The self-proclaimed ‘Easter obsessed’ village, donned their Easter bonnet best and hopped at the chance to get involved in some early Easter fun. Within minutes, the entire parish (plus some curious local sheep and lambs) was gathered on mass, in search of its eggs. Egginton was led to a giant purple Cadbury Easter egg, peaking through the daffodils in a nearby open space. The generous collection was made up of hundreds of Cadbury Easter eggs – one for everyone in the village to enjoy or hide for someone special this Easter.]]></summary>

Mr Andrews announced his visit to China was to increase the desirability of Melbourne’s universities for prospective Chinese students but won’t reveal specific details.

“I’m concerned that the only reports we’ll get out of it will be by state-run media in China and I’d really like to know what the purpose is of this visit,” Mr Tehan told Sky News Australia.

“I mean he should clearly articulate what the purpose is, why he’s going, what is the outcome he’s seeking to achieve from this secret, secret trip that he’s taking that he will not take any reporters with him on.”]]></summary>

Washington (AFP) - The United States on Tuesday opens its second Summit for Democracy with its eyes firmly on the rest of the world, seeking a united front against authoritarianism as Russia attacks Ukraine and as China launches a diplomatic offensive.
President Joe Biden took office pledging to champion democracy, and in his first year made good with the inaugural summit, which sought to reaffirm US leadership after his predecessor Donald Trump eroded democratic norms and the attack on the Capitol. 
This time round, in a nod to concerns that the first edition was too much about US navel-gazing, Biden has tapped co-hosts …]]></summary>

Jerusalem CNN  — Massive crowds filled the streets of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv late Sunday night after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul. 
Waving Israeli flags and chanting “democratia,” protestors could be seen blocking streets and bridges, including the Ayalon Highway.  Protesters lit several fires on the main highway in Tel Aviv, their acrid, black smoke billowing into the sky, partly obscuring some of the city’s iconic skyscrapers. 
Demonstrators also gathered beside the highway, burning scrap metal and wood with almost no police around.

        <updated>2023-03-27T00:17:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - The United States is deeply concerned by events in Israel and "strongly urges" leaders there to find compromise as soon as possible, a White House spokesperson said on Sunday after the firing of Israel's defense minister triggered mass protests.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday, a day after Gallant broke ranks with the government and urged a halt to a highly contested plan to overhaul the judicial system.
"We continue to strongly urge Israeli leaders to find a compromise as soon as possible. We believe that is the best path forward for Israel and all of its citizens," White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement.
Some three months since taking office, Netanyahu's nationalist-religious coalition has been plunged into crisis over the bitter divisions exposed by its flagship judicial overhaul plans.
The overhaul package would tighten political control over judicial appointments, handing the executive wider freedom to name judges to the Supreme Court.
"As the president recently discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu, democratic values have always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel relationship," Watson said.
"Democratic societies are strengthened by checks and balances, and fundamental changes to a democratic system should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support."

Japan's Coast Guard said the projectile believed to be North Korea-fired missile has already fallen.

The United States and Soviet troops shook hands over the waters of the Elbe River on April 25, 1945. That water is now poisoned. 
A recent Gallup poll reveals the depth of the negative feeling:       
Americans’ already-negative opinions of Russia have soured further in the past year, dropping from 15% holding a favorable view to 9%. The current reading for Russia is the lowest Gallup has measured since it first asked about the “Soviet Union” in this format in 1989. 
 Russia is now the fourth country in Gallup’s polling of country favorable ratings to register a sub-10% favorable score. Iran, Iraq and North Korea have had ratings below 10% on multiple occasions. The all-time low favorable rating for any country was 3% for Iraq in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War.

WNU Editor: The only prominent US political leader that is talking about the need to find a quick and peaceful end to the Ukraine war is former President Trump. But he is going against the media narrative and public opinion. And as the above Gallup poll unfortunately reveals, in the current environment Washington is more motivated to escalate the conflict against Russia, rather than stabilizing the situation to find a peaceful solution.]]></summary>

The U.S. said it carried out strikes on facilities affiliated to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria after a drone attack killed an American contractor in Syria.

“He was for the COVID-19 vaccines before he was against them, but now Florida’s governor is all-in on vaccine skepticism—and hoping to use the issue to outflank Trump on the right.”
Vanity Fair is appalled at Ron DeSantis’s “flip flopping.”  They are not so much concerned with Fauci’s, or other “experts.”  Remember how Fauci said masks were useless before they were lifesaving?  Or when getting a vax meant you would not get Covid, before you could only get a mild case, before you needed 5 boosters?  Or when vaccines prevented the spread of Covid before they didn’t?  Or when Covid originated on the w…]]></summary>

The tiny island of Tinian was the launch point for American planes carrying atomic bombs to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Now a new runway is being carved from the jungle, just south of World War II ruins inked with mildew. 
And on a blustery February morning a few hundred yards away at Tinian’s civilian airport, American airmen refueled Japanese fighter jets during a military exercise using more airstrips, islands and Japanese planes than the two enemies-turned-allies have ever mustered for drills in the North Pacific.

VOA: Iran Could Make Fuel for Nuclear Bomb in Less Than 2 Weeks, Milley Says  
Iran could make enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb in “less than two weeks” and could produce a nuclear weapon in “several more months,” according to the top U.S. military officer. 
Speaking to members of Congress on Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told lawmakers the United States “remains committed” to preventing Iran from fielding a nuclear weapon. 
“We, the United States military, have developed multiple options for national leadership to consider if or when Iran ever decides to develop an actual nuclear weapon,” Milley added.

ABOARD THE KV SORTLAND — NATO ally Norway has announced that it is boosting the number of naval patrols near vital undersea gas pipelines off its coast, and released a trove of videos exclusively to NBC News illustrating what it sees as a growing Russian threat in the Arctic. 
The videos provided by the Royal Norwegian Air Force capture the high-stakes cat-and-mouse game between the two militaries, with Russian attack submarines patrolling near a maze of undersea pipelines carrying vast amounts of natural gas to Europe and telecommunication cables linking Europe and America. 
According to the head of the Royal Norwegian Navy, the videos indicate that Russian attack submarines and planes have expanded their presence in the High North, operating near Norway’s natural gas pipelines that represent a vital energy lifeline for Europe.

   Warzone/The Drive: Nordic Air Defense Pact Combines Forces Of Hundreds Of Fighter Aircraft 
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are working to combine air defense forces in the face of the Russian threat. 
To better cope with threats emanating from Russia, the countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have created a unified Nordic air defense alliance, pooling the resources of their air forces. They have upwards of 300 fighter jets between them as well as training, transport and surveillance fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. 
Those four nations on Friday announced they signed the first Nordic Air Commanders' Intent last week during a meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
“The declaration of intent strengthens Nordic cooperation and paves the way for further strengthening of the Nordic air forces,” the four nations said Friday in a joint statement. “The ultimate goal is to be able to operate seamlessly together as one force by developing a Nordic concept for joint air operations based on already-known NATO methodology.”

It would be “very difficult” to bring the entire truth to light, the Russian president admitted in comments to journalist Pavel Zarubin in the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Putin expressed his hope that at some point in time “it will be finally revealed what was done and how.”

        <updated>2023-03-26T00:53:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Twitter Inc CEO Elon Musk has offered the social-media company's employees stock grants at a valuation of nearly $20 billion, the Information reported on Saturday, citing a person familiar with an email Musk sent to Twitter staff.
The reported valuation is less than half of the $44 billion that Musk paid to acquire the social media platform, pointing to a drop in Twitter's value.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters' emailed request for a comment.
Musk said in December that Twitter is on track to be "roughly cash flow break-even" in 2023 as top advertisers slashed their spending on the social-media platform after the billionaire' s takeover.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian Labor Party in New South Wales claimed power in a state election on Saturday, with voters backing the centre-left party's pledges on anti-privatisation and cost of living relief.
The election in Australia's most populous state had been touted as a tight race between the incumbent Liberal-National coalition and Labor, but the vote count on Sunday showed Labor on track to take the 47 seats needed to form majority government, after three terms in opposition.
The win marks further endorsement of the party of Australia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, who joined his state counterpart Chris Minns - who is set to become New South Wales' 47th premier - in Sydney on polling day.
"A huge congratulations to @ChrisMinnsMP ... and the whole NSW Labor team on your election victory," Albanese said on Twitter late on Saturday.
Labor's win in New South Wales means the party now governs at state and federal level across Australia's mainland, leaving island state Tasmania as the conservative outlier.
"After 12 years in opposition the people of New South Wales have voted for a fresh start," Minns told supporters in Sydney late on Saturday.
"The people of New South Wales voted to put in a government that would put people at the heart of all decision-making".
Labor's campaign in the state featured a pledge to rule out further privatisation of state assets, and a promise to boost public sector wages, amid cost-of-living concerns.
Outgoing premier Dominic Perrottet, a social conservative Catholic and former state treasurer, was elected premier in 2021 after his predecessor resigned after a corruption watchdog probe into whether she was involved in conduct that "constituted or involved a breach of public trust".
Albanese, in the lead up to polling day, had urged voters in his home state to back Labor, saying the coalition government was "in shambles" due to infighting.

Politico:  Ukraine sees no way to negotiate peace with Putin after war crimes warrant  
Kyiv sees Putin’s abduction of children as part of a genocidal attempt to wipe out its culture and identity. 
KYIV — Last week’s international arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia has made it impossible for Kyiv to accept Russia’s president as a potential interlocutor for any peace deal to end the war. 
The International Criminal Court issued its warrant on Friday. The crime of children being forcibly taken to Russia is especially sensitive as Ukrainian and Western lawyers identify the deportations as falling within the legal definition of genocide, as part of an attempt to wipe out Ukrainian cultural identity. 
Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian president’s office head and representative of Ukrainian negotiations group in Istanbul, promptly tweeted that identifying Putin as “an obvious international criminal directly means there will be no negotiations with the current Russian elite.”

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
