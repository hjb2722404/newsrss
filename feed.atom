DUBAI — Iranian security forces fired live rounds and tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters in several provinces on Thursday, according to posts on social media, as protests triggered by rising food prices continued to spread. 
Iranians took to the streets last week after a cut in food subsidies caused prices to soar by as much as 300% for some flour-based staples. 
The protests quickly turned political, with crowds calling for an end to the Islamic Republic, echoing unrest in 2019 which began over fuel prices hike.  Social media footage not verified by Reuters showed at least six people killed and dozens injured in past days. 
There has been no official comment on any death toll.

Investing.com/Bloomberg: China in Talks With Russia to Buy Oil for Strategic Reserves 
(Bloomberg) -- China is seeking to replenish its strategic crude stockpiles with cheap Russian oil, a sign Beijing is strengthening its energy ties with Moscow just as Europe works toward banning imports due to the war in Ukraine. 
Beijing is in discussions with Moscow to buy additional supplies, according to people with knowledge of the plan who asked not to be named as the matter is private. Crude would be used to fill China’s strategic petroleum reserves, and talks are being conducted at a government level with little direct involvement from oil companies, said one person.

BBC News: Israeli coalition government in crisis as MP quits 
The future of Israel's government has been plunged into uncertainty after a member quit, leaving it as a minority in parliament for the first time. 
The Arab member of the coalition resigned, saying she could not tolerate its leaders' "right-wing stances" towards her section of society. 
The unexpected move means the coalition commands only 59 seats out of 120. 
The most diverse coalition in Israel's history has been in power for just under a year. 
Led by nationalist Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, it brought together eight parties from across the political spectrum, some with major ideological differences. 
Significantly, the government included an independent Arab party for the first time since the state was founded in 1948.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ABC News: Biden backs Sweden, Finland joining NATO as Turkey threatens to block the historic bids  
Finland and Sweden submitted their historic applications on Wednesday. 
President Joe Biden welcomed Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö to the White House on Thursday to discuss their historic bids to join NATO. 
All three leaders called for swift acceptance of the applications amid resistance from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who announced Thursday that his country will oppose Finland and Sweden joining the alliance.

Update #1: Biden cheers Finland, Sweden NATO plans as Turkey balks (Reuters)  
Update #2: Biden pushes Finland and Sweden to join NATO as future of European security questioned (Yahoo News)   
WNU Editor: The US Senate will approve Sweden's and Finland's NATO application .... Senate on track to approve NATO bids of Finland and Sweden (Politico). Turkish President Erdogan is another story .... Erdoğan doubles down on threat to reject Finland and Sweden's NATO bids (Axios).
Update #3: Hmmmm .... I am now hearing growing opposition to Finland and Sweden joining NATO from opposition leaders in Italy and Bulgaria. Is this the reason why Biden had to go publicly today to show his support to Finland and Sweden to join NATO? After-all. If this was a done deal, why make this White House statement by the US President. 
As for Turkey's opposition. I am now hearing that Erdogan was not consulted on Finland and Sweden's NATO bids. And he is not alone. I am hearing other countries were also not consulted. If true, this is showing a lot of amateurism from the White House who first pushed and green-lighted this NATO bid by Finland and Sweden.]]></summary>

* The measure brings the total U.S. funding of the conflict to $54 million in two months 
* The bill passed 86-11 but a handful of Republican objectors complained that there were more pressing problems at home to tend to and 
* They also said the funding did not have adequate oversight 
* Biden is expected to quickly sign the bill, as he and Ukraine sounded the alarm that the nation would run out of aid by Thursday if Congress did not act 
In a largely bipartisan vote the Senate passed a bill Thursday to provide $40 billion more in aid to Ukraine as the war with Russia stretches on into its fourth month.

(Bloomberg) -- China’s top diplomat again warned the US over its increased support for Taiwan, showing the island democracy remains a major sticking point between the world’s biggest economies as Beijing sent more military aircraft toward the island.

Yang said Washington should “have a clear understanding of the situation,” according to a statement posted online by his nation’s Foreign Ministry. “China will certainly take firm action to safeguard its sovereignty and security interests,” he added.

The Senate approved a massive military, economic, and humanitarian aid package.
 The Senate voted 86 to 11 to pass a $40 billion Ukraine aid package Thursday in the latest bipartisan signal of Washington’s deepening commitment to Ukraine’s grinding war against Russia.
The bill includes a huge one-time outlay of military and security assistance, along with funding for mounting economic and humanitarian needs. This latest legislation comes in addition to the $13.6 billion in emergency assistance for Ukraine that Congress approved in March, bringing the total of the United States’ Ukraine aid to a historic $53 billion since the start of the war.

Politico: Biden resists Ukrainian demands for long-range rocket launchers 
Officials in Kyiv say the weapons could help in the fight against Russia, but the White House is worried about escalating. 
Ukrainian officials are growing frustrated with the Biden administration’s resistance to providing U.S.-made long-range rocket systems, a weapon Kyiv says is critical to outgunning Russia in the heavy artillery duels raging across the Donbas. 
Officials across the Ukrainian government have pleaded with the U.S. for months to send the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. But three people familiar with the issue say the Ukrainians are concerned that the White House is holding back over worries the weapon could be used to launch strikes inside Russia, thereby expanding and prolonging the conflict.

Irina Borogan & Andrei Soldatov, CEPA: The Shadow War: Putin Strips Spies of Ukraine Role  
Behind-the-scenes maneuvering signals continuing battles for power among the Russian security forces, the siloviki. 
Vladimir Putin has removed Russia’s biggest intelligence agency, the FSB, from its role as the primary spy agency for the war in Ukraine and handed responsibility to a heavily militarized branch of military intelligence, the GRU. 
The new lead officer, Vladimir Alekseyev, the first deputy head of the GRU, is heavily implicated in several of Putin’s most serious attacks on the West over the past decade. He is accused by the UK and the European Union of overseeing the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury in 2018. An experienced special forces officer, he is also sanctioned by the US for direct cyber interference in the US 2016 election.

Update #2: Putin sacked the FSB and put the secretive GRU spy agency in charge of Ukraine intelligence after a string of failures, top Russian journalists say (Business Insider)   
WNU Editor: No one is really privy to how the Kremlin is conducting its war in Ukraine. But what we do know is that Putin's inner circle is still around him, particularly his top intelligence and military officials, and the military campaign continues in Ukrraine.]]></summary>

Reuters: Russia, Ukraine Peace Talks Stall Amid Mutual Recriminations

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNBC: Dow drops 1,100 points for its biggest decline since 2020 as the sell-off this year on Wall Street intensifies 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest loss since 2020 on Wednesday after another major retailer warned of rising cost pressures, confirming investors’ worst fears over rising inflation and rekindling the brutal 2022 sell-off. 
The Dow shed 1,164.52 points, or 3.57%, to 31,490.07, the average’s biggest decline since June 2020. It was the lowest close for the Dow since March 2021. 
The S&P 500 traded 4.04% lower to 3,923.68, also the worst drop since June 2020. 
The Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.73% to 11,418.15, which is the largest fall in the tech-heavy index since May 5. 
The selling was broad and intense on Wall Street with just eight members of the S&P 500 in the green.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FILE PHOTO: A view shows an armoured convoy of pro-Russian troops outside Donetsk   
Reuters: With troops in Ukraine, Russia's defence spending leaps 40% 
(Reuters) - Russia's defence spending was up nearly 40% in the first four months of the year, according to preliminary data released by the finance ministry on Wednesday, almost three months into Moscow's large-scale military campaign in Ukraine. 
Russia spent 1.7 trillion roubles ($26.4 billion) on defence between January and April, almost half the 3.5 trillion roubles, or 2.6% of GDP, budgeted for all of 2022. 
The ministry had initially forecast a budget surplus of 1% of GDP, or 1.3 trillion roubles, for 2022, but now expects a deficit of at least 1.6 trillion roubles, allowing for support payouts to counter the effect of an unprecedented barrage of Western economic sanctions.

Politico:  US to end Russia debt servicing allowance, says Treasury chief Janet Yellen  
She also floated the idea of imposing a tariff or price cap on Russian oil exports — which has yet to catch on in Brussels. 
BONN, Germany — Washington is willing to let a provision allowing Russia to make bond payments expire, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced Wednesday — a move that increases the chance Moscow will default on its foreign debt. 
The clause, which falls under the U.S. sanctions regime, has allowed Russia to service its foreign debt so far with the approval of the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). It's set to expire on May 25. 
"The expectation was for it to be time limited. It’s reasonably likely to expect that the license will be left to expire," Yellen said, speaking to reporters in Bonn, Germany, ahead of a G7 finance ministerial meeting. "A final decision hasn’t been taken yet, but I think it’s unlikely that it would continue."

Update: US ‘likely’ to scrap Russia debt payment exemption: Yellen (AFP) 
WNU Editor: Russia's next debt payment is on May 27, two days after Moscow will be blocked from making a payment. My gut tells me that international financial markets are going to go through a roller coaster ride next week and beyond. 
On a side note.  After U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made her remarks, the Dow Jones tumbled 1,000 points (as of 14:00 EST). The blame is on poor results from Target and Walmart, but I think it is more than just that.]]></summary>

Reuters: Yellen: Not legal for U.S. to seize Russian official assets 
BONN, Germany (Reuters) -The United States does not have legal authority to seize Russian central bank assets frozen due to its invasion of Ukraine, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, but talks with U.S. partners over ways to make Russia foot the bill for Ukraine's post-war reconstruction are underway. 
Yellen also said it is likely that the special license granted to allow Russia to make payments to its U.S. bondholders would not be extended when it expires next week, leaving Russian officials a fast-narrowing window to avoid its first external debt default since the Russian revolution.

Update #1: Janet Yellen says 'it would not be legal now' for the US to seize Russian government assets to pay for Ukraine reconstruction (Business Insider)  
Update #2: Seizing Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine illegal – US (RT) 
WNU Editor: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was very careful in what she said. She said "it would not be legal now", meaning it may become legal in the future. My gut tells me that the decision to not return these seize assets has already been made, regardless on what happens in Ukraine or in Russia, and what Yellen said today was to not escalate the current tensions between the US and Russia.]]></summary>

   Daily Mail: Pentagon clears ITSELF over Syria war crimes: Review finds US troops did not deliberately kill 56 civilians including a woman and three children in airstrikes in 2019 and claims one child had taken up arms 
* Pentagon on Tuesday released findings from probe into 2019 strike on Baghuz 
* Four civilians were confirmed killed by US bombs as ISIS made its final stand 
* Now the Pentagon claims that the military did not violate the laws of war 
* Review acknowledges 'procedural mistakes' in the aftermath of the airstrikes 
* But no one, including the ground force commander, was disciplined 
A Pentagon investigation has determined that US troops did not commit war crimes or deliberately kill civilians in 2019 airstrikes in Syria that killed dozens of people, including women and children. 
The strikes on Baghuz, where desperate ISIS fighters were holed up and making their final stand, killed at least four civilians, but were kept secret for years until they came to light last fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BALTIMORE — The new wall in left field at Camden Yards served its purpose, denying Aaron Judge a home run on his 399-foot drive in the first inning.
“I learned my lesson and decided to go in the right field after that,” he said.


Ballpark couldn’t hold off Judge’s next two hits, a pair of solo homers that gave him a major league-leading 14 and helped the Yankees to a 5-4 win over the Yankees. Baltimore Orioles Tuesday night.  Judge and reliever Michael King was the biggest star in the win, New York’s 20th in its last 23 games.


According to Statcast, the judge’s two homers went 410 and 422 feet, after his double was just under 400. The judge’s reaction to the new dimensions at Camden Yards was about what you’d expect from a right-handed puncher .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He is also one of the best players in the NHL in any position.  He was named one of three finalists for the Hart Trophy for most valuable player of the regular season and is almost guaranteed to receive the Vézina Trophy for top goaltender.  All voters needed was his .935 save percentage and 2.07 goals-against average, both league-best.
Shesterkin, 26, was drafted out of Russia by Rangers in the fourth round of the 2014 draft and fit right into a line of Rangers goalkeepers dating back to the early 1990s with Mike Richter, who was followed , two years after his own retirement.  , by Henrik Lundqvist in 2005.
“What a series of goaltenders we’ve seen here with the Rangers,” said Eddie Olczyk, a TNT analyst and Richter’s teammate on the last Rangers team to win a Stanley Cup, in 1994. It hasn’t been a problem for Rangers, and when you have it, you have a chance to win every night.
Olczyk said he spoke to Gallant months ago about Shesterkin, and the coach praised him for the goalkeeper’s incredible ability to read, react and get in the right position before the shot or the pass.
“I don’t think you hear that very often,” Olczyk said.  “He seems to know what’s going to happen first.  When this happens, you are playing five card stud with six cards.  It’s a very good hand to play with.
Lundqvist was like that too.  He was still a Ranger when Shesterkin made his debut on January 7, 2020. Shesterkin spoke very little English then, and it was difficult for Lundqvist to communicate with him in a casual and thorough manner to get a sense of who Shesterkin was.  .  But he noticed his new team-mate was rather relaxed and chatty with other Russian-speaking Rangers players, like Pavel Buchnevich and Vladislav Namestnikov, both of whom are no longer with the team.
Now a Rangers analyst on the MSG Network, Lundqvist says Shesterkin’s laid-back demeanor was key to the Russian goalkeeper’s ability to withstand pressure and failure – what little he had of it.

In suburban Kansas City, the Olathe, Kansas, school district lost more than 1,000 of its approximately 33,000 students in 2020 as families relocated and switched to private schools or home schooling;  only about half of them returned this school year.
In rural Woodbury County, Iowa, south of Sioux City, the inscription at Westwood Community School District fell more than 5% in the past two years, from 552 to 522 students, despite a small influx from cities during the pandemic, Superintendent Jay Lutt said.  Today, in addition to demographic trends that have long eroded the size of rural Iowa school populations, diminishing funding, the district is grappling with inflation as the price of fuel for school buses has soared in arrow, Mr. Lutt said.
In some states where schools have avoided distance learning — Florida, for example — enrollment has not only rebounded, but remains robust. Analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank, concluded last month that distance education was a major driver nationwide, with enrollment declining the most in districts most likely to have delayed their return to classrooms in person.
Private schools also recorded enrollment gains.  Federal enrollment counts have yet to be released, but the National Association of Independent Schools and the National Catholic Educational Association have reported increases totaling about 73,000 K-12 students over the past two years.
At the same time, some families are leaving their local public schools not because they are dropping out of the system altogether, but because they have moved to other parts of the country that are more affordable.
Enrollment also increased in rural resort areasdriven by the relocation of tech workers and others able to work remotely, especially after the pandemic took hold.

The war in Ukraine is having a drastic impact on Africa. Prices for wheat, gas and gasoline are at record highs. Crisis regions could see things get worse than they already are. 
Every morning, the operators of a small kiosk located in an informal neighborhood in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, bake fresh chapati — a popular flatbread. 
Chapatis usually cost around 20 shillings (€0.17/$0.17). However, customers can hardly afford it anymore. "Chapati costs twice as much now. Life has become extremely expensive," one customer at the kiosk complained.

G7 and European Union leaders are discussing proposals to seize Russian Central Bank assets and use them to finance aid to Ukraine, Germany's finance minister said Tuesday. 
Christian Lindner said he is "politically open to the idea" but acknowledged that "in the case of private assets, we have to see what is legally possible."

Bloomberg: US Set to Block Russian Debt Payments, Raising Odds of Default 
(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration is poised to fully block Russia’s ability to pay US bondholders after a deadline expires next week, a move that could bring Moscow closer to the brink of default. 
The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control is expected to let a temporary exemption lapse once it expires on May 25, according to people familiar with the matter. 
he waiver, issued shortly after the US levied sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine in February, has given Moscow room to pay coupons, helping it avert default on its government debt. 
The end of the carve-out could be the final straw in Russia’s debt saga after almost three months of war in Ukraine. It’s managed to make all its payments to creditors so far, weaving through the tangle of sanctions that closed off some avenues. 
That includes an 11th-hour escape earlier this month, when blocked payments were eventually allowed through after Moscow tapped its domestic dollar reserves. But it’s unclear how it can sidestep the end of the US loophole.

Reuters: Ukraine's president replaces head of Territorial Defence Forces 
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has replaced the head of its Territorial Defence Forces nearly three months into the war with Russia without giving a reason. 
The Defence Ministry said on Monday Zelenskiy had appointed Major General Ihor Tantsyura to take over from Yuriy Halushkin as commander of the forces that are helping the Ukrainian army defend the country following Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. 
The ministry described Tantsyura as an experienced officer who was previously chief of staff of Ukraine's ground forces.

Domestic terrorism,” Mr. Biden told mourners in this upstate New York town.  “Violence inflicted in the service of hatred and the vicious lust for power that defines a group of people as inherently inferior to any other group, a hatred that, through media and politics, the Internet, has radicalized individuals into angry, alienated, lost and isolated in the mistaken belief that they will be replaced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US State Department announced a new unit Tuesday to research, document and publicize alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine.
The Conflict Observatory will "capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine," the department said.
The Observatory will collect publicly and commercially available information, including what is seen on social media and commercial satellite imagery, for use in current and future civil and criminal legal processes.
Nearly three months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv says it has identified thousands of suspected war crimes cases.
Most notorious have been the allegations of wanton murder of scores of civilians in Bucha, just outside Kyiv.
The Observatory will create an online platform "to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses," the department said.
The Observatory will be a joint effort by the department; Esri, a mapping software company; Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab; the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai, which combines artificial intelligence-based analysis with satellite imagery and other data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US investigators believe someone on board deliberately crashed a China Eastern flight in March, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, in what was China's deadliest air disaster in decades.
China Eastern flight MU5375 was travelling from Kunming to Guangzhou on March 21 when it inexplicably plunged from an altitude of 29,000 feet into a mountainside, killing all 132 people on board.
So-called black box flight data recorders recovered from the site were sent to the United States for analysis.
That data shows that someone -- possibly a pilot or someone who had forced their way into the cockpit -- input orders to send the Boeing 737-800 into a nosedive, according to Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the probe.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed the two countries to abandon their military neutrality for NATO.
 Finland and Sweden are seeking membership to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a historic shift for two traditionally non-aligned countries and a major expansion of the Western alliance as war continues in Europe.
Leaders from Sweden and Finland said Tuesday they will officially turn in their NATO applications together on Wednesday. They will then head to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden, as the US makes a show of support for their bids.

DW: German state election leaves Chancellor Scholz reeling 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz is digesting a major defeat after his Social Democrats were comfortably beaten into second place in North Rhine-Westphalia. He now needs a favor from the surging Green Party. 
Sunday night's election victory in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) must have tasted extra sweet for the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU). As in the federal election, the vote in Germany's most-populous state was long described as a neck-and-neck race between the CDU and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), only for a previously unheralded candidate to score a clear victory.

WNU Editor: I have been told that the high cost of living is what was/is on the minds of many Germans. And justifiably so. The Russian - Ukraine war is impacting Germany's energy supplies/prices, and in turn the economy. But while this was a major election loss for the SPD in one of their long held strongholds, it will not impact current German policy towards the war .... Scholz’s party keeps Ukraine policy despite state vote loss (AP).

Beirut, Lebanon (CNN)The Iran-backed political and militant group Hezbollah has lost its parliamentary coalition majority in a Lebanese election that delivered significant gains to its rivals as well as to a protest movement that swept the country in a 2019 uprising, final results showed Tuesday. 
Reformist political groups that sprung out of the nationwide demonstrations have won around 10% of the country's parliamentary seats, according to a CNN tally, in a sign of growing discontent with a ruling elite widely blamed for the country's economic collapse. Reformist parties won only one seat in the previous election cycle in 2018.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed guests at the Cannes Film Festival via video link on Tuesday as the annual event got under way.
Speaking during the opening ceremony, Zelensky drew a comparison to Charlie Chaplin's film "The Great Dictator" as he called on world cinema not to "remain silent" in the face of Russia's attack on Ukraine.
"Hundreds of people are dying every day," he said. "They will not get up after the final applause."
Afterwards, actress Julianne Moore officially opened the film festival, and the first film "Coupez!" (Final Cut) was screened.
The film by Michel Hazanavicius is a comedy set in a disused factory where the filming of a low-budget zombie film gets a little out of hand.
US Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, 60, also received a honorary Palme d'Or at the opening ceremony. Whitaker will present his film "For the Sake of Peace" in the French resort. It is about people who are working for peace in South Sudan.
The walls of shops and streets in Cannes are lined with film posters and a large "Top Gun" installation has been set up in front of the Grand Hôtel.
A giant pilot helmet points to one of the most anticipated screenings at the festival.
On Wednesday, Tom Cruise is scheduled to present "Top Gun: Maverick" - the sequel to the cult film from 1986.
The official poster for the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, which was designed as a homage to The Truman Show, is seen on the facade of the Palais des Festivals. The festival will take place from 17 to 28 May 2022. Frederick Injimbert/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa]]></summary>

Trump’s decision to withdraw the quasi- all of the 700 ground troops stationed there, according to four officials familiar with the matter.
In addition, Mr. Biden has approved a request from the Pentagon for permanent authorization to target a dozen suspected leaders of Al Shabab, the Somali terror group affiliated with al-Qaeda, three of the officials said.  Since Mr. Biden took office, airstrikes have largely been limited to those intended to defend partner forces facing an immediate threat.

For months, the health worker, Bhanwar Bai Jadoun, had advised the woman to give birth in the hospital.  But the woman’s mother-in-law insisted on giving birth at home with the help of a local midwife.
Now complications had set in.  Mrs. Jadoun suggested taking the woman urgently to a hospital 10 miles from the village, Bagdoli;  she would notify the doctors there.  An auto rickshaw was arranged.  Both mother and baby were saved.
“When people see me every day, they know they can trust me,” Ms Jadoun said.  “They see me as their guide to healthy living.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Power, air conditioning and railway service: such are the amenities of a sophisticated tunnel the length of five football fields, used to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into the United States, said officials who made the shock discovery.
Federal authorities in California discovered the underground passageway last Friday as part of an investigation that led to the arrest and charging of six people, according to a Department of Justice criminal complaint.
Stretching from Tijuana, Mexico to a warehouse in Otay Mesa, south of San Diego, it is thought to be 1,744 feet (530 meters) long, 61 feet deep and four feet in diameter, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California said in a statement Monday.
Underground, officials found "reinforced walls, a rail system, electricity and a ventilation system."
Six people were charged with conspiring to distribute 1,762 pounds (800 kilograms) of cocaine, and officials also seized 164 pounds of methamphetamine and 3.5 pounds of heroin.
US Department of Homeland Security agents conducting surveillance on a suburban San Diego home tracked suspects to a stash location some 300 feet from the border. While inspecting the building, the agents discovered the tunnel access point, dug right out of the cement floor.
"There is no more light at the end of this narco-tunnel," US Attorney Randy Grossman said in a the statement. 
"We will take down every subterranean smuggling route we find to keep illicit drugs from reaching our streets and destroying our families and communities."
Cross-border tunnels are frequently used by traffickers who smuggle migrants lured by the "American dream," or drugs, into the United States, the world's largest consumer of South American cocaine. 
According to US figures, more than 90 tunnels have been discovered in southern California alone since 1993, including another "sophisticated" underground passageway located in March 2020.]]></summary>

 DW: Mexico's number of 'disappeared' people rises above 100,000 
There are now over 100,000 people in Mexico's national register of the "disappeared." The UN says organized crime is among the leading causes of missing people in the country. 
Mexico's official figure of missing people on Monday surpassed 100,000 for the first time as families pushed authorities to do more to find victims of violence linked to organized crime. 
The interior ministry compiles a national register of the "desaparecidos" — Spanish for missing people —  which is periodically updated. 
In the last two years the numbers have spiked from about 73,000 people to more than 100,000 — mostly men.

The first successful test of a prototype AGM-183A ARRW comes as the program’s future is increasingly uncertain. 
The Air Force says that it has finally successfully test-launched a prototype of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW. This follows three failed launch attempts last year and comes as the service is reassessing the future of the program. 
The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force announced the successful AGM-183A test flight late on May 16, 2022. The test itself had taken place on May 14. As had been the plan from the beginning, a B-52H Stratofortress from the 419th Flight Test Squadron launched the missile over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California.

The landslide victory of Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of the country’s longtime dictator, has exposed one of liberal democracy’s greatest vulnerabilities.
 Last week, voters in the Philippines went to the polls — and, by an overwhelming margin, chose the son of the country’s deposed dictator as their next president.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr., widely referred to by his nickname, Bongbong, ran on a ticket with Vice President-elect Sara Duterte — the daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, a populist most famous for his policy of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers, who pushed the Philippines toward au…]]></summary>

Without amending the Constitution of Canada, Charles will automatically succeed Queen Elizabeth II as head of state of Canada, like all British monarchs since the founding of the country.  Poll after poll shows the 96-year-old Queen who has battled some recent health issues is widely respected by Canadians.
However, for several years an ever-decreasing number of Canadians, according to polls, have wanted to swear allegiance to another British monarch, in particular Charles, who is hated by many here and who represents an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Secret Service documents obtained by The Daily Dot show that agents charged with protecting former President Donald Trump feared that he would have a milkshake hurled at him during a 2019 trip to the United Kingdom.
Ahead of the trip, anti-fascists activists in the U.K. started a campaign called "Splash the Fash" that targeted far-right political figures such as Trump ally Nigel Farage with milkshakes.
To protect the then-president from the threat of getting pelted by a delicious summer treat, the Secret Service monitored social media accounts that fantasized about dousing him with milkshakes.
"We’ll have to keep an eye on SplashThe[Fash],” one Secret Service official wrote in a message obtained by The Daily Dot. “I’m sure it will get a lot of attention. I’ll pass it along to the person monitoring the trips.”

The official added that they would "not waste a milkshake" by using it to attack Trump.
At other points, the agents acknowledged that it would be very hard for them to contain all potential milkshakes that could potentially be lobbed at the president.
“At some point on this trip, one of the 4 of us is getting 'Milkshaked,'" one person in the Presidential Protective Division wrote in another message obtained by The Daily Dot.

The United States and Europe have coordinated closely to enact sweeping sanctions against Russia in the nearly three months since its president, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered an invasion.  But they have been less aligned with the need to help sustain Ukraine’s economy and help rebuild it once the war is over.
Congress has already approved $13.6 billion emergency spending package for Ukraine and should approve another $40 billion in aid.  While the European Union and international financial institutions have also made significant aid contributions, Ms Yellen said more needs to be done.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christina Bobb, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, struggled to explain this week why her boss would endorse Mehmet Oz for Senate if the candidate would not falsely say the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
In an interview with Bobb, Real America's Voice host Ed Henry explained that host David Brody had asked Oz why he had refused to call the election "rigged" or "stolen."
"I want to be careful," Oz replied.
Henry seemed shocked by the answer.
"As you know, Oz was a very controversial endorsement by your boss, Donald Trump," the anchor told Bobb. "And now you add to it, when asked by David Brody -- again, not in a gotcha way -- do you think the last election was stolen? He basically wouldn't answer."

Spring has come to Bucha in the six weeks since Russian soldiers withdrew from this dormitory community outside kyiv, leaving behind mass graves of massacred citizens, many maimed, and streets shattered and destroyed buildings.
A semblance of normal life has returned to the city.  Residents have returned to Bucha in recent weeks, and the city has moved to repair the physical damage caused by russian invasion troops and their weapons.  Now, in the verdant spring streets of the city, it’s hard to imagine the horrors that unfolded here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US rock band Eagles of Death Metal were midway through their set when Islamist militants sprayed the Bataclan concert hall in Paris with gunfire, cutting down revelers, frontman Jesse Hughes recounted before a French court on Tuesday. 
Guitar technician Eden Galindo's first thought had been that the sound system was exploding, but Hughes said he knew instantly the venue was under attack.
"Being from a desert community in California, I know the sound of gun shots," Hughes told the trial of Salah Abdeslam, the only suspected surviving member of the squad that killed 130 people at several locations on November 13, 2015.
"I knew that death was coming," he said.
The assailants burst through the music hall's main entrance and blasted automatic gunfire into the crowd as the band played.
"We were thinking that it was going to stop but it just kept coming," Galindo told the court. "After a while they reloaded and a technician told us, 'next time they stop, we run'."
The band escaped through a side door but their tour manager was killed.
The attackers took hostages inside the music hall during an hours-long assault that claimed 90 lives and ended after police shot dead one militant and the two others detonated their suicide vests.
Survivors have recounted playing dead for hours, or hiding in cupboards, not knowing if their friends or relatives were still alive. They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.
Abdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.

He told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.
Six years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.
"Evil did not win," he said. "You can't kill rock and roll."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - His doctors probably don't agree but Pope Francis thinks a shot of tequila just might help his painful knee.
While his popemobile stopped in St. Peter's Square at his last general audience, a group of Mexican seminarians shouted out to him, asking how his leg was doing.
"It's being naughty," the Argentine pope replied in Spanish. A flare up of pain in his knee and existing leg problems have forced the pope to use a wheelchair at times recently.
One of seminarians then thanked the seated pope for continuing to carry out his duties despite the pain, telling the 85-year-old Francis that his persistence was an example for them as future priests.
Noting that they were Mexican because of the flag they were carrying, the pope said: "Do you know what I need for my leg? A bit of tequila."
After much laughter, one of them shouted back: "If one day we go to Santa Marta, we'll bring you a bottle," referring to the guest house where Francis lives in the Vatican.
One of the seminarians, Rodrigo Fernández de Castro, posted the exchange, which took place at the general audience last Wednesday, on TikTok.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, The Daily Beast reported that Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine is still running strong in Russia, with a Kremlin spokesperson telling the Russian people that invasion of Ukraine will "make life better" for them.
This is in spite of the fact that the ensuing embargo by western nations has caused the Russian economy to implode, with a leaked internal Kremlin forecast projecting the economy to shrink by 12 percent just this year alone.
""We are in fact now living in the conditions of a perfect storm and the moment of truth, that very storm and moment of truth that will ensure and protect our interests, and make it so that your lives are better, more comfortable, more stable, and more secure," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to Daily Beast reporter Allison Quinn. 
Peskov also claimed that "our president knows where he is leading our country" and that 'the whole country supports him.'"

Quinn skeptically notes that "the war that the Kremlin has depicted as a heroic crusade against nonexistent neo-Nazi leaders in Ukraine has led to hundreds of foreign companies cutting ties with Russia, killed as many as 27,000 Russian troops, and, according to Ukrainian intelligence, left Putin’s military in shambles."
Meanwhile, experts believe Russia's military has taken such heavy losses that their war aims may have to be scaled back again. Even Russian military analysts appear to be more pessimistic in their reports on state TV.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's extremely rare for a Russian military expert to criticize the performance of the country's armed forces. 
But according to Mikhail Khodaryonok, a defense analyst, his country's war in Ukraine isn't going according to President Vladimir Putin's plan -- and likely is failing.
The BBC's Francis Scarr, who regularly monitors Russian state TV, posted a subtitled video clip on Twitter in which Khodaryonok offered his bleak assessment of the war effort in Ukraine.
"First of all, we shouldn't take information tranquilizers," he said, "because sometimes information is spread about some morale and psychological breakdown in the Ukrainian armed forces, which are allegedly on the verge of some kind of crisis of morale and so on. All of that, to put it mildly, is false."

Khodaryonok noted that the United States shipments of advanced military weapons to Ukraine is being effective in helping the country defend itself against the Russian onslaught, "despite the resistance of a single senator." Kentucky Republican Rand Paul last week blocked Senate consideration of a new U.S. aid package to Ukraine.
"A million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future," Khodaryonok said. "and we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us frankly will get worse."
Watch the defense analyst's entire take on the Russian war effort below or at this link.

In an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation. It's fairly long but worth your time so I've added subtitles.pic.twitter.com/0mr7WAgSx6

Disappearances have skyrocketed in the wake of mounting drug violence that has rocked the country for 16 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters shows that keeping global warming below the key 1.5°C threshold by the end of the century will require not just halting the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure, but also shutting down many existing sites.
"Some existing fossil fuel licenses and production will need to be revoked and phased out early."
Led by Kelly Trout of Oil Change International, the study estimates that 40% of fossil fuel reserves at currently operational development sites across the globe must be left in the ground if the world is to have a 50-50 chance of adequately slashing carbon emissions and limiting warming to 1.5°C or below.
If fossil fuel reserves at existing sites are extracted, the researchers find, nations will "substantia…]]></summary>

(Reuters) -Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies have lost their majority in Lebanon's parliament in a general election, a Reuters tally of final results showed on Tuesday, a major blow to the heavily armed group that reflects anger with Lebanon's ruling elite.
The Shi'ite Muslim movement and factions that support its possession of arms won around 62 of parliament's 128 seats in Sunday's election, a reversal of the 2018 result when they secured a majority of 71.
In the first election since Lebanon's economic collapse and the Beirut port explosion of 2020, reform-minded political newcomers won about a dozen seats, making an unexpectedly strong breakthrough into a system long dominated by the same groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sandstorm engulfed Saudi Arabia's capital and other regions of the desert kingdom Tuesday, hampering visibility and slowing road traffic.
A thick grey haze made iconic Riyadh buildings such as Kingdom Centre nearly impossible to see from more than a few hundred metres (yards) away, though there were no announced flight delays or cancellations.
The kingdom's meteorology centre forecast "surface dusty winds" in the country's east and in Riyadh, "reducing horizontal sight", according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
Dusty conditions were also expected farther west in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, according to the forecast.
Electronic signs along Riyadh's highways warned drivers to reduce their speed because of the lower visibility.
In central Riyadh, sand layered cars and buildings, and residents struggled to keep it out of their homes.
"Working outside is very difficult because of the dirt," a Pakistani construction worker who gave his name as Kalimullah told AFP as he installed tiles.
"I try to wash my face from time to time," the 30-year-old added, wrapping a piece of cloth around his face to block the sand.
Saudi office worker Abdullah Al-Otaibi said he was grateful he works indoors.

"Dust storms are part of our culture and we are used to it, but some of them are severe," said Al-Otaibi, 39, rubbing his eyes as he hurried into his office building.
Parts of Saudi Arabia typically see sandstorms between March and May, with varying intensity. The frequency of the storms has increased in recent months in the region.
Neighboring Iraq has experienced eight sandstorms since mid-April, a phenomenon fueled by soil degradation, intense droughts and low rainfall linked to climate change.
In Iran on Tuesday, government offices and schools and universities were closed in many provinces due to "unhealthy weather" and sandstorms, state media reported.
