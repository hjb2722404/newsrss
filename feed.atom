More widespread use of data analytics and automated tools could result in a clean audit, says Pentagon finance chief. 
Another year, another failed financial audit for the Pentagon. But while it could be years before it passes for the first time, the key to getting a clean audit may be contingent on increased use of analytics, bots, and automated systems, according to the Defense Department’s finance chief.  
“We failed to get an ‘A’,” Mike McCord, the Pentagon’s comptroller and chief financial officer, told reporters Tuesday, announcing the results of the department’s fifth annual audit. “The process is important for us to do, and it is making us get better. It is not making us get better as fast as we want.”

CNBC/Reuters: Oil prices slide as supply fears recede 
Oil dropped by more than $2 a barrel on Friday, on track for a second weekly decline, due to concern about weakened demand in China and further increases to U.S. interest rates. 
Brent crude was down $2.80, or 3.1%, at $86.97 a barrel by 11:48 a.m. EST, having touched its lowest since Sept. 28 at $85.80. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down $2.79, or 3.4%, at $78.85. 
Both benchmarks are heading for a second weekly loss, with Brent on track for about a 9% decline and WTI heading for a 10.5%. 
As part of the rout, the market structure of both oil benchmarks shifted in ways that reflect dwindling supply concerns.

"Construction of all eight frigates is expected to be completed by the mid-2030s, with the first, HMS Glasgow, entering service by the end of 2028," state the UK MoD. 
DUBLIN — In a two day span this week, the UK Ministry of Defense (MoD) pledged funding of $7.9 billion to industry contractors for the second batch of Type 26 frigates and building of Fleet Solid Support ships, as part of a major modernization effort for the Royal Navy. 
Announcing the $6 billion contract award to BAE Systems for City Class (as designated in Royal Navy service) frigates on Nov. 15, London said five new ships are to be manufactured and will lead the Royal Navy’s anti-submarine warfare surface fleet.

Breaking Defense:  Under shadow of financial losses, Boeing makes sweeping changes to defense biz  
The changes, including halving business divisions, come as Boeing’s defense sector finds itself at a crossroads, with new leadership contending with systemic financial issues tied to its large number of fixed-price contracts with the US government.  
WASHINGTON — Boeing is overhauling its defense, space and security organization, cutting down from eight business divisions to four in the hopes of boosting performance amid a string of financial losses, the company announced today. 
“I am confident this reorganization will drive greater and more simplified integration and collaboration across Boeing Defense, Space & Security,” said Ted Colbert, chief executive of Boeing’s defense sector. 
“These changes will help accelerate operational discipline and program quality and performance, while stabilizing our development and production programs. These are necessary steps to put BDS on the path to stronger, profitable growth.”

Russian strikes have devastated Ukraine’s energy networks as winter approaches. 
 In Kyiv, residents prepare for daily blackouts. They’re typically staggered by neighborhood, and don’t happen all at once; four hours off, four hours on, like that, all day, a checkerboard of light and dark, hot and cold, across the capital. People in Kyiv can look up their addresses and check the weekly schedule, so they’ll remember when to charge their phones or take a shower. The planning helps, but it isn’t foolproof. The power can go out without warning. Russia can send in more missiles, as they did this week.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said 10 million Ukrainians are without power after a fresh wave of missile strikes by Russia. 
At least seven people were killed in the strikes, with the number expected to rise. 
"We are doing everything to normalise the supply," Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address.  Ukraine's air defence managed to shoot down six cruise missiles and five drones, he added. 
On Thursday, Russia pounded Ukraine with a fresh missile barrage, hitting more energy installations and civilian buildings less than two days after one of its heaviest bombardments yet.

Reuters: Biden administration says Saudi prince has immunity in Khashoggi killing lawsuit 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration ruled on Thursday that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has immunity from a lawsuit over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, drawing immediate condemnation from the slain journalist's former fiancee. 
Khashoggi was killed and dismembered in October 2018 by Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, an operation which U.S. intelligence believed was ordered by Prince Mohammed, who has been the kingdom's de facto ruler for several years. 
"Jamal died again today," Khashoggi's ex-fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, said on Twitter minutes after the news became public. She added later: "We thought maybe there would be a light to justice from #USA But again, money came first."

NBC: Traces of explosives found at Nord Stream pipelines, confirming 'gross sabotage,' Sweden says 
European officials had previously blamed Russia for the blasts, accusing the Kremlin of starting an energy war to damage international support for Ukraine. 
 Investigators found traces of explosives at the site of the damaged Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic sea, confirming that the pipelines had been subject to “gross sabotage,” the Swedish Security Service said Friday. 
In a statement, prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said that investigators had seized a number of “foreign objects” at the site of the damaged pipelines, which showed traces of explosive residue after analysis. 
The statement did not expand on how the explosives might have got there and said an investigation was ongoing.

WNU Editor: No surprises here. But No comment from Sweden on who they believe is responsible for this attack.

World War Three fear levels escalate once more after news breaks of the latest rocket to be launched off the country's east coast under the orders of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un 
The US Air Force Misawa Air Base in Japan urged its personnel to take shelter after news broke of a ballistic missile being launched off the east coast of North Korea. 
According to outlets in South Korea, the latest rocket was fired early on Friday morning (November 18) and follows a succession of weapons tests conducted by Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un during recent weeks. 
It is believed this projectile was an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) and the test follows reports of another at a similar time yesterday (Thursday, November 17), which the South claimed was aimed towards the Sea of Japan.

Many of the National Security Agency’s most talented cyberthreat hunters have traded the beige corridors and heavily guarded security perimeter of Fort Meade for a surprisingly located new office — in an unsecured suburban office park in Maryland. 
Officials say the pedestrian location is exactly the point: The NSA’s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center is designed to bring NSA cyber analysts closer to outside threat hunters. 
By anchoring the center in a largely unclassified environment, NSA officials say they are trying to reduce bureaucratic barriers and make it easier for agency talent to work more closely with increasingly vital private sector security researchers. 
“No guns, no guards, no gates,” Morgan Adamski, the director of the CCC, told CyberScoop in an interview. “We want to have a very friendly environment.”

The football star addressed specific issues that hadn’t changed since 2009 when he first decided to part ways with the club.

“Everything was so fast, but what surprised me a lot (was) instability in the club; everything was kind of the same,” he told Sky News Australia host Piers Morgan during an exclusive interview.

Ronaldo is under contract with Manchester United until 2023; however, he’s expressed his interest in leaving the club at the end of the year as the next transfer window is set to open in the next couple of months.]]></summary>

A Dutch court has found two Russians and one Ukrainian guilty and handed down life sentences, while one suspect was acquitted.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says many major corrupt officials left the country after the full-scale invasion by Russia this February. 
The president spoke via videoconference at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, Ukrinform reports with reference to Zelensky's press service. 
 "The main things we should pay attention to are these: we are united, those remaining are willing to defend their state. No one will be able to forgive corruption in the future Ukraine. We have all gone through very difficult challenges and a very difficult time," Zelensky said.

Update: Zelensky declares Ukraine corruption-free (RT)   
WNU Editor: Zelensky also hope that after the war ends, Russia’s economic, political, and informational influence will disappear .... 
.... There will be no influence of Russian capital in Ukraine – they either pulled out from our enterprises or we pushed them out. The political party is banned and they will not run in the next elections. There will be no media influence on our development and neither will there be any in the geopolitical direction".]]></summary>

Kazakhstan said Thursday it had prevented a coup attempt by supporters of an exiled opposition figure as it arrested seven people ahead of a presidential election this weekend. 
On Sunday, Kazakhstan will hold a snap presidential vote expected to cement incumbent Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's grip on power, months after deadly unrest shook the Central Asian country and left more than 230 people dead. 
The National Security Committee said a group of seven people planned to "organise riots and a coup and proclaim a provisional government," adding that the suspects "share the views of exiled opponent Mukhtar Ablyazov".

President Volodymyr Zelensky has said 10 million Ukrainians are without power after a fresh wave of missile strikes by Russia.

"We are doing everything to normalize the supply," Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address. 
Ukraine's air defence managed to shoot down six cruise missiles and five drones, he added.

NATO says Ukraine not at fault after evidence suggest missile that landed in Poland did not come from Russia  President Biden Thursday disputed comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who remains confident that the "explosion" that killed two in Poland did not come from a Ukrainian missile.

Newsweek: U.S. NASAMS Having 100% Success Rate in Stopping Russian Missiles: Pentagon 
Air defense systems provided by the U.S. have had a perfect strike rate in intercepting Russian missiles fired into Ukraine, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said. 
As Moscow continues to fire rockets at Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure, Austin praised the efficacy of the NASAMS (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) that the U.S. has supplied as part of its military support for Kyiv. 
Austin told a briefing on Wednesday that the systems sent to Ukraine "are now operational, and their performance so far has been very impressive.
"  "The NASAMS systems had a 100 percent success rate in intercepting Russian missiles as the Kremlin continues its ruthless bombardment of Ukraine," he said.

Biden wants to reevaluate Saudi Arabia policy. Here are four questions to guide the review.
 President Joe Biden wants a re-evaluation of the United States’s policy toward Saudi Arabia. 
In early October, the kingdom announced that, together with the OPEC+, it would cut oil production, effectively raising gas prices and siding with Russia’s best interests. After almost two years of navigating the difficult relationship with the oil-rich autocracy, it was the event that pushed Biden to say, “There’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done, with Russia.”

Reuters: Black Sea grain export deal extended, but Russia wants more on fertiliser exports 
Nov 17 (Reuters) - A deal aimed at easing global food shortages by facilitating Ukraine's agricultural exports from its southern Black Sea ports was extended for 120 days on Thursday, though Moscow said its own demands were yet to be fully addressed. 
The agreement, initially reached in July, created a protected sea transit corridor and was designed to alleviate global food shortages by allowing exports to resume from three ports in Ukraine, a major producer of grains and oilseeds.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised by this grain export deal extension. Turkey wants this deal to continue, and Russia wants good ties with Turkey. 
But Western sanctions that block developing countries from purchasing fertilizer from Belarus and Russia is what is causing the most harm on global food supplies. Especially in Africa, where they can only buy this fertilizer using Western banks, but Western banks are prohibited from dealing with Russia and Belarus. Talk about being caught in a Catch-22 position.

Ken McCallum, director-general of MI5, added to mounting warnings from British authorities about Russia's aggression and China's growing assertiveness. 
He also singled out Iran as a mounting concern, saying U.K authorities have uncovered at least 10 "potential threats" this year to "kidnap or even kill British or U.K.-based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime." 
 He said Iran's intelligence services "are prepared to take reckless action" against opponents, both on Western soil and by luring people to Iran.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Antiwar.com: See 867 Military Bases on New Online Tool 
World Beyond War has launched a new online tool that allows the user to view a globe pock-marked with 867 U.S. military bases in countries other than the United States, and to zoom in for a satellite view of and detailed information on each base. The tool also allows filtering the map or list of bases by country, government type, opening date, number of personnel, or acres of land occupied. 
This visual database was researched and developed by World Beyond War to help journalists, activists, researchers, and individual readers understand the immense problem of excessive preparation for war, which inevitably leads to international bullying, meddling, threats, escalation, and mass atrocity. By illustrating the extent of the US empire of military outposts, World Beyond War hopes to call attention to the wider problem of war preparations.

Washington Post: CIA director met Zelensky in Kyiv as Russian missiles targeted capital 
CIA Director William J. Burns met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday, reaffirming U.S. support for the country on the same day Russian missiles pummeled the capital and sent residents fleeing for cover. 
The visit came at a moment of Ukrainian triumph, days after its forces liberated the city of Kherson and Zelensky declared a turning point in the war. But it was a moment of extraordinary tension and uncertainty, too, as a Russian-made missile appeared to land in Poland, raising the question of how the NATO alliance might respond to a possible attack on a member state.

The Hill: Milley tried to speak with Russian counterpart on Tuesday but was ‘unsuccessful’ 
 Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley attempted to speak with his Russian counterpart on Tuesday following a missile-caused explosion in Poland but was unable to get through, the top military official revealed Wednesday. 
Milley said his staff tried to connect him with Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov but they were “unsuccessful in getting me linked up.” 
 He instead spoke several times with his Ukrainian counterpart, with his Polish counterpart and with other chiefs of defense in Europe, Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. 

U.S. officials are still waiting on more information as to the exact origin of a Soviet-era missile that struck within Poland’s borders on Tuesday, killing two.

“It’s visible on the streets,” Mr Lea said. 

The apparent willingness of China’s President Xi Jinping to talk with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Joe Biden at the G20 conference in Bali is raising hope it could lead to a thawing of relations between China and the West. 

However, the tension between China and Taiwan has only escalated significantly in the past months with the visit of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island and subsequent military drills conducted by both countries.]]></summary>

Several social media users accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of attempting to lead the world into a new war over a missile strike that hit Poland and left two individuals dead.
"UKRAINE tried to start WW3 yesterday when a UKRAINIAN missile struck a NATO country and killed innocent civilians. Ukrainian leaders LIED and BLAMED RUSSIA. The AP wrote it up unquestioningly," conservative commentator Benny Johnson wrote on Twitter. "Ukrainian Leaders LIED to try and initiate full-blown WW3. These are the facts." 
The tweet comes shortly after there were reports that a "Russian-made" missile struck Polish territory near the area of Przewodow. Following the reports, Zelensky said that it was a "really significant escalation" amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.

Update: Poland Missile Attack Triggers Surprise Clash as Blame Game Spirals (Daily Beast)   
WNU Editor: Ukraine President Zelensky is not trying to start World War III over this missile strike. But he does want more aid and direct involvement from the West. 
But if he wants more aid he should stop claiming that yesterday's missile strike was not caused by a Ukrainian missile .... Zelenskyy doubles down and pushes back on Western assessments that a Ukrainian missile killed 2 in Poland (Insider). More here .... Zelensky insists missile that hit Poland was not Ukrainian (The Hill). Pushing this narrative after NATO said it was not a Russian missile is making him look desperate, and in turn it is making some people in the West nervous.]]></summary>

While Europe has been keeping a generally optimistic facade ahead of the coming cold winter, signaling that it has more than enough gas in storage to make up for loss of Russian supply even in a "coldest-case" scenario, behind the scenes Europe's largest economy is quietly preparing for a worst case scenario which include angry mobs and bankruns should blackouts prevent the population from accessing cash. 
As Reuters reports citing four sources, German authorities have stepped up preparations for emergency cash deliveries in case of a blackout (or rather blackouts) to keep the economy running, as the nation braces for possible power cuts arising from the war in Ukraine. The plans include the Bundesbank hoarding extra billions to cope with a surge in demand, as well as "possible limits on withdrawals", one of the people said.

WNU Editor: I think Germany will do OK this winter. Energy prices and the general cost of living will be high for everyone, but unrest and protests will be limited. I am more worried about next winter, when there is no Russian gas to top off your storage tanks, and everyone around the world is in a scramble to grab what they can.]]></summary>

Moscow Times/AFP: Russia Falls into Recession 
Russia's economy has entered a recession as gross domestic output fell by four percent in the third quarter, according to first estimates published Wednesday by the national statistics agency, Rosstat. 
The drop in GDP follows a similar four percent contraction in the second quarter, as Western sanctions pummel Russia's economy following Moscow's offensive in Ukraine. 
The four percent drop in economic output between July and September was less than the 4.5 percent contraction analysts had expected.  The contraction was driven by a 22.6 percent plunge in wholesale trade and a 9.1 percent drop in retail trade. 
On the bright side, construction grew by 6.7 percent and agriculture by 6.2 percent.

Update #1: Russian Economy Shrinks 4% in Third Quarter - Statistics Agency (Reuters) 
Update #2: Russia enters recession, GDP shrinks 4% in third quarter (WION)                                                                                                                                                   
WNU Editor: I have said it many times in the past. Russia's economy is weird. 
The economy is in recession but everyone is working. The ruble is one of the strongest currencies in the world, even though the West has imposed comprehensive sanctions. The country is so filthy rich when it comes to resources that I think only the surface has so far been scratched, and there are buyers for everything that is produced. There is no government debt (it actually has a surplus). And everyone has a side hustle that I know is off the books even though I would estimate it represents a fifth of the economy.]]></summary>

Officially, the gunman is believed to have acted alone, but Khan said he suspected the assailant was merely a decoy serving the interests of a state-level conspiracy. He directly accused current top Pakistani government leaders, saying they feel threatened by his party's popularity in view of the next elections in the country. Khan also said he feared he could be attacked again in the near future: "They think that the only way to get me out of the way is actually [to] eliminate me.

The new rule, introduced this week, further squeezes women out of an ever-shrinking public space that already sees them banned from traveling without a male escort and forced to wear a hijab or burqa whenever out of the home. 
Schools for teenage girls have also been shut for over a year across most of the country.

Beijing (AFP) - Fresh from securing a historic third term as China's top leader, President Xi Jinping is poised for a triumphant re-entry to the world stage at a pivotal G20 summit next week.
After almost three years of self-imposed pandemic isolation where international diplomacy was largely conducted via videolink, China now aims to shore up its global alliances -- especially with developing countries -- in the face of increased competition with the United States and a world environment destabilised by the Ukraine war.
A flurry of state visits to China in the past week have highlighted the importance of maintaining trade and other diplomatic ties -- even as China acts more assertively to defend its interests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he thinks Twitter boss Elon Musk's relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
Biden was asked at a news conference whether he thought Musk was a threat to national security and if his acquisition of Twitter with help from a Saudi Arabian conglomerate should be investigated by the U.S. government.
"I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at," Biden said.
"Whether he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at."
The White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were "not true."
Musk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.
The world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.
Musk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.
Musk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.
He also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
Ian Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russia ordered its troops to withdraw from the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Wednesday in a further major blow to its campaign amid a Ukrainian counter-offensive.
"Begin to pull out troops," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a televised meeting with Russia's commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin.
The commander had proposed the "difficult decision" of pulling back from the city and setting up defences on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River.
Kherson city was the first urban hub captured by Russia during its "special military operation" and the only regional capital controlled by Moscow's forces since the offensive began on February 24.
Ukraine's troops have for weeks been capturing villages en route to the city near the Black Sea and Kremlin-installed leaders in Khers…]]></summary>

Security forces opened fire on protests that erupted on September 30 after weekly prayers in Zahedan, capital of the flashpoint province of Sistan-Baluchistan on Iran's border with Pakistan.
It came two weeks after demonstrations broke out across Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, following her arrest in Tehran for allegedly flouting the country's strict hijab dress rules for women.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.
The comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.
The artefact provides "direct evidence" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.
The 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to "May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard," the statement said.
"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel," Garfinkel noted, calling it "a landmark in the history of the human ability to write".
Lachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.
Archaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first "entire verbal sentence" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.
It noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.

Griner, who has been jailed for nine years for possession of a small quantity of cannabis oil, was transferred out of a detention centre on November 4, her legal team said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Tuesday that the UK will continue to play a vital role in NATO for generations, ahead of a visit by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The NATO chief will be the first international leader Sunak has met in Downing Street since he took office last month.
Wednesday's talks will centre on UK support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February, and the alliance's future, Sunak's office said.
"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage, we must not take peace at home for granted," Sunak said in a statement.
"I am determined the UK will be the bedrock of NATO for generations to come," he added.
"But in order to face the challenges of the future we must evolve as an alliance to meet, and remain ahead of, the threat from our adversaries."
NATO said separately that Stoltenberg would also meet UK foreign minister James Cleverly.
Stoltenberg will meet Sunak after visiting a military facility where Ukrainian troops are being trained by British military.
Britain has offered to train a total of 19,000 Ukrainian recruits in vital battlefield skills including marksmanship, weapons handling, urban and trench warfare and first aid.
Sunak announced on Tuesday that the UK is sending Ukrainian soldiers extra equipment to help them get through the harsh winter, including more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold weather clothing, 12,000 sleeping kits and 150 heated tents.
One of the new prime minister's first calls in the job was to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had close ties with former prime minister Boris Johnson.
Sunak promised him he would continue Britain's "steadfast support" and solidarity for Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show "Drag Race," it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.
The Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series "RuPaul's Drag Race" that has inspired spin-offs including "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World."
"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise," local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.
Publicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau "talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens," whom he welcomes to Canada.
Contestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.
In a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.
The room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.
The show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fortune Pink diamond, an exceptionally rare giant gemstone, sold for more than $28.5 million at auction in Geneva on Tuesday to a private Asian collector.
At 18.18 carats, the gem is the largest pear-shaped "fancy vivid pink" diamond ever sold under the hammer, Christie's auction house said.
The dazzling diamond fetched a hammer price of 24.5 million Swiss francs ($24,615,150), rising to 28,436,500 Swiss francs ($28,570,150) with the buyer's premium added on.
The bidding, which lasted for a tense four minutes, started at 17 million Swiss francs and was a three-way battle between telephone bidders, with the winner eventually claiming the gem by upping the bid by half a million.
The diamond was exhibited in Geneva then headed to New York, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore in October before returning to Switzerland.
It was auctioned in the Magnificent Jewels sale at the Hotel des Bergues, part of Christie's Luxury Week of sales in Geneva.
The Fortune Pink had been estimated to fetch between $25 million and $35 million.
The world record for a pink diamond was set in 2017, when a stone known as the CTF Pink Star was sold in Hong Kong for $71.2 million.
