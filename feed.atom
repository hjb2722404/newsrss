Ethiopia's Tigray rebels said Sunday they were ready for a ceasefire and would accept a peace process led by the African Union, removing an obstacle to negotiations with the government to end almost two years of brutal warfare. 
The announcement was made amid a flurry of international diplomacy after fighting flared last month for the first time in several months in northern Ethiopia, torpedoing a humanitarian truce. 
"The government of Tigray is prepared to participate in a robust peace process under the auspices of the African Union," said a statement by the Tigrayan authorities.
"Furthermore, we are ready to abide by an immediate and mutually agreed cessation of hostilities in order to create a conducive atmosphere." 
The Ethiopian government has previously said it was ready for unconditional talks "anytime, anywhere," brokered by the Addis Ababa-headquartered AU.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Al Jazeera: Ukraine troops ‘outnumbered Russia’s 8 times’ in counterattack 
Russian-installed official admits serious lack of battlefield readiness during Kyiv’s surprise offensive in the Kharkiv region. 
Ukrainian forces outnumbered Russian troops by eight times during the rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region, a Russian-installed official said. 
Vitaly Ganchev said Ukrainian soldiers captured previously Russian-held settlements in the region’s north, breaking through to the border with Russia, and “about 5,000” civilians had been evacuated to Russia. 
Ganchev told the state-owned Rossiya-24 television channel on Monday “the situation is becoming more difficult by the hour”, adding the border with Russia’s Belgorod region was now closed. 
During the weekend, Ukrainian forces overran the key Russian supply hubs of Izyum and Kupiansk, where the Kharkiv region’s Russian-appointed administration had been based.

Update: The Guardian: Ukraine’s gains expose thinly spread Russian invaders. More could follow (The Guardian).   
WNU Editor: It always comes down to how many boots you have on the ground, and how well equipped they are. 
It is because of reports like the above coupled with this morning's attacks on Ukraine's power grid that I now believe the Kremlin is going to upgrade its conflict in Ukraine from a "special military operation" to an anti-terrorist operation along the same lines that it operates on in Syria. What this means is that the list of targets will now be expanded that will also include Ukraine's leadership. It will (or course) also mean the deployment of more Russian troops and equipment into the conflict.]]></summary>

LONDON (Reuters) - Commentators on Russian state television have been forced to go off script by Ukrainian forces' swift advance in the country's Kharkiv region and Moscow's rapid retreat. 
Since the beginning of what Russia calls its “special military operation”, belligerent guests on state television talk shows typically have tried to outdo each other in backing President Vladimir Putin and denouncing Ukraine and its allies. 
But in the wake of Kyiv’s lightning counteroffensive, the mood was more subdued and the narrative turned to how allegedly Ukrainian forces overwhelmingly outnumbered the Russians in the northeast. 
The Rossiya-24 news channel on Monday interviewed Vitaly Ganchev, a Russian-appointed official in the Kharkiv region, who said that Russian troops in the province had been outnumbered “eight times over.” 
He also said, without providing evidence, that Ukrainian forces had been bolstered by “Western mercenaries”.  "A most difficult week on the front," presenter Dmitry Kiselyov said at the opening of his prime time Sunday night program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: Sweden election: Result could take days as vote too close to call 
Sweden's election was too close to call on Sunday night, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said. 
Exit polls at first predicted victory for the incumbent left-wing coalition, but results later suggested the right-wing bloc could narrowly win. 
Immigration and crime were major issues in the campaign, and the far-right Sweden Democrats look set to become the second-largest party. 
It could take until Wednesday for all votes to be counted.  Soon after polls closed, an early exit poll by Sweden's public broadcaster suggested Ms Andersson's coalition of four left-wing parties would narrowly win, with 49.8% of the vote compared to 49.2%. 
But the left's celebrations were perhaps premature, as later partial results put the right-wing group ahead, with a projected 176 of 349 seats in parliament after 94% of electoral districts were counted.

Ukraine’s second largest city and several strategic hubs were liberated in the operation.
 A surprise counteroffensive over the weekend saw Ukrainian troops push into areas around Kharkiv in the northeast, liberating villages and cities, and catching Russian troops flat-footed. The swift maneuvers threatened to encircle a portion of the Russian army and led them to rapidly abandon positions and military hardware as Ukrainian troops closed in.

Earlier this month, Iran sent its latest response to the European Union's proposed text to restore the 2015 agreement under which Tehran had restrained its nuclear program in exchange for relief from U.S., EU and U.N. economic sanctions. 
Diplomats have said Iran's response to the EU coordinator was a step backward, with it seeking to link a revival of the deal with the closure of investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) into traces of uranium at three sites.

Modified: 09/09/2022 11:05:16 AM



There is ongoing discussion and analysis of the ex-president’s removal of classified White House documents from the media.  Although the actions of the ex-president are problematic, they are not surprising.  However, shouldn’t the bigger story, and the outrage, be how these documents were able to leave the White House in the first place?
In most workplaces, when a disgruntled employee is fired, they are told to collect their belongings under the supervision of a security guard and then escort them out of the building.  The ex-president was ousted by the American people in November 2020, and he was clearly unhappy, denying the election results and promoting plans to prevent the peaceful transition of power.  So how is it that as a private citizen, the ex-president left the White House with boxes of documents belonging to the American people?  What systems or people did we have in place to prevent this from happening?  How have these systems/people let us down?
Investigations are underway to assess the impact of the actions of the former president on national security.  However, some impacts are already known.  Our allies will think twice about sharing information with us now that they know we cannot keep confidential documents secure.  Significant damage has been done regardless of what the recently recovered boxes contain.
I’m not a fan of the former president and I understand the political motivation of the left wing media to focus on the culpability of the former president, but we can’t ignore the national security failure that has happened. product.  This should be the main story.

Ukraine’s quick action to reclaim Russian-occupied areas in the northeastern Kharkiv region forced Moscow to withdraw its troops to avoid being surrounded and leave behind significant numbers of weapons and ammunition in a hasty retreat as the war marked 200 days in Sunday. 
Overjoyed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mocked the Russians in a video speech on Saturday, saying that “the Russian army these days is demonstrating the best it can do – showing its back.”

* Tuesday is the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
* The day after the attacks, newspapers around the world reacted by capturing the sadness, shock, and horror people felt.
* We compiled front pages from American and international newspapers to show what people woke up to on September 12, 2001.
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks happened exactly 17 years ago Tuesday.
For many people, the attacks were the biggest news story of their lifetime. Almost all who experienced it can remember where they were when they heard of the attacks.
Many people who remember that day also recall the following morning, when newspapers around the world captured the horror, shock, and sadness people felt.
The Newseum, a museum in Washington, DC, that chronicles the history of media, archived more than 100 newspapers from September 12, 2001, the day after the attacks. The front pages of these newspapers, bearing headlines like "ACT OF WAR" and "AMERICA'S DARKEST DAY," underscore the impact the attacks had on the American psyche.
Here is what newspapers looked like the day after September 11, 2001.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JAKARTA (Reuters) -About 200 people evacuated to higher ground after an earthquake of magnitude 6.1 struck islands in western Indonesia on Sunday, causing some property damage, the country's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said.
The quake in the Mentawai Islands west of Sumatra struck at a depth of 27 km (17 miles) and was followed by one of magnitude 5.3 in the same area, authorities said. There was no danger of tsunami.
One person was injured in the head by falling wood, and a school and health centre were among properties slightly damaged, the disaster agency said.
Mentawai resident Nurjuli Hasanah told Reuters the quake felt strong and shook her wooden house. "Some of (the residents) are still in an evacuation shelter and some have gone back home,” she said.
Also on Sunday, east of the vast Indonesian archipelago, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the Eastern New Guinea region in Papua New Guinea, reportedly damaging property and spreading panic among residents.
Indonesia straddles the "Pacific Ring of Fire", where different tectonic plates of the Earth's crust meet and create frequent seismic activity.

It was an overwhelming victory for Pierre Poilievre.  Poilievre, 43, became the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada on Saturday night after a lengthy and divisive seven-month leadership campaign that saw him be a clear frontrunner on all accounts – whether it be membership sales or fundraising.

“The day after the announcement, people said to me, young and old, they just couldn’t get to sleep, they couldn’t believe what had happened  – this rock, this woman who stood for decency, honour, integrity, Christianity, service – had gone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge: On September 11, the war between Ukraine and Russia will have been going on for 200 days. 
The latter launched its offensive on February 24 after months of amassing troops at the Ukrainian border, attacking the former on several fronts from the North, East and Southeast. 
While it looked like Russia would emerge as a winner in the conflict initially, Ukraine managed to defend several strategic locations.

WNU Editor: I am not surprised that the consensus is growing in the U.S. that this is going to be a long war. I know among all of my friends and family members in both Ukraine and Russia there is a resignation that this war is going to go into 2023 and maybe even into 2024. 
As to what is my take. I can now easily see this war going into 2024. 
As to how will it end? 
As I have mentioned before, I believe it will end when European governments, tired of the enormous cost in supporting Kyiv in this conflict, will say "enough is enough" and tell Zelensky to make a deal with Putin or they will cut off aid. We are already seeing EU states slow walking aid to Ukraine, aid that was promised months ago .... EU finance ministers back next $5 billion loan to Ukraine (Reuters). More here ....

The much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s special forces have said. 
Ukrainian forces are continuing to make unexpected, rapid advances in the north-east of the country, retaking more than a third of the occupied Kharkiv region in three days. Much of Ukraine’s territorial gains were confirmed by Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WNU Editor: This is what happens when a front line collapses. And while I am sure that Ukraine has lost a lot of soldiers in their Kharkiv counter-attack, they have gained significant territory and they now have the military momentum in this part of the war. 
Reaction to this defeat on Russian social media has been predictable and quite a sight to see today. Criticism of President Putin and the Generals who are responsible for the war have been widespread and brutal. I am sure Putin is now feeling the pressure to change his military strategy from a "special operation" to something that is more significant. 

The next few days are going to be critical. The Russian Ministry of Defense clearly underestimated this Ukraine counter-offensive, and they are now deploying heavy reinforcements to blunt it. But this takes time, and for now Ukraine will take advantage of their momentum. 
The big surprise (for me) in this counter-offensive are the actual low number of soldiers that are involved (for now). At the beginning of the Kharkiv counter-offensive Ukraine deployed anywhere from 9,000 - 15,000 soldiers. And on the Russian side it was mostly Donbas militia numbering only a few thousand mixed with a few thousand regular Russian forces to face the Ukrainians. 
On a thousand mile long front there are always going to be gaps and weaknesses, and in this case the Ukraine military saw an opportunity and they took it.  The big question that needs to be answered is .... can Ukraine keep this territory that they have recaptured? 
I say this because a few months ago Ukraine launched a counter-offensive to the north of Kharkiv and they were very successful. Even reaching the border of Russia, albeit briefly. But within a few weeks they were driven back to their original positions, experiencing heavy casualties. 
Will history repeat itself? We shall see.]]></summary>

The Ukrainian army has recaptured around 2,000 square kilometres of territory this month in areas previously occupied by Russia as part of Ukraine's counter-offensive, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
In a video speech on Saturday evening, Zelensky thanked all the soldiers who were involved in the recapturing territory in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine.
Earlier in the day, Russia's military announced a withdrawal from the region.
The Russian army made a good decision by fleeing, Zelensky asserted: "Occupiers have no place in Ukraine and will not have one."]]></summary>

		The state-run TASS news agency quoted Russia's defence ministry as saying it had ordered troops to leave the vicinity to reinforce operations elsewhere in neighbouring Donetsk.
	

		The head of Russia's administration in areas in Kharkiv it controls told all residents to evacuate the province and flee to Russia to "save lives", TASS reported. Witnesses described traffic jams of cars with people departing Russian-held territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) -Prince Harry and his wife Meghan joined Prince William and wife Kate to look at the tributes and flowers left outside Windsor Castle on Saturday following the death of Queen Elizabeth.
Relations have been strained between the two sons of Britain's new king after Harry and Meghan moved to the United States and the four had not been seen so closely together since.
William's spokesman said he had invited Harry and Meghan, officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, to join him and Kate as they examined the flowers and spoke to crowds lining the entrance to Windsor Castle.
The sight of the two couples together will raise hopes that there has been a rapprochement following the death of Britain's longest-reigning monarch.
William was heard telling one well-wisher that the days following the queen's death had been "so surreal".
"We all thought she was invincible," he said.

"How about we talk a little bit more about colonialism," he began. "The first Elizabethan era ended when Queen Elizabeth the First died in 1603. Her 45 year reign was, quote, 'a golden age,' though I guess that depends on your perspective which marked England's emergence as an ambitious and ruthless global power."

"It was frightening," said 61-year-old Anatoli Vasiliev, recalling this week's battle when Ukrainian troops recaptured Grakove from the Russians.
"There were bombings and explosions everywhere."
Vasiliev stood in front of the local church, whose bell had been damaged by a projectile.

China's rising pressure on Taiwan, North Korea's nuclear test threats and Russia's invasion of Ukraine are among issues to be discussed, with the summit likely to be held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting, Kyodo said, citing sources in both governments.
Kishida is also likely to attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth in Britain together with Japan's Emperor Naruhito before visiting the United States, TV Asahi reported earlier on Saturday. Biden has said he will attend the queen's funeral.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Saturday visited several areas of Pakistan ravaged by floods, as he rounded off a two-day trip aimed at raising awareness of the disaster.
Record monsoon rains and glacier melt in northern mountains have triggered floods that have killed more than 1,391 people, sweeping away houses, roads, railway tracks, bridges, livestock and crops.
Huge areas of the country are inundated, and hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes. The government says the lives of nearly 33 million have been disrupted. Pakistan estimates the damage at $30 billion, and both the government and Guterres have blamed the flooding on climate change.

She was the country’s longest-reigning monarch, serving for 70 years and presiding over the end of the British Empire. Her death set off a period of national mourning in the U.K. and has thrown the future of the monarchy into doubt. “The monarchy really has come to represent deep and profound and grave inequality,” says Cambridge scholar Priya Gopal, author of “Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent.” We also speak with Harvard historian Maya Jasanoff, Novara Media editor Ash Sarkar and Pedro Welch, former chair of the Barbados Reparations Task Force, who says the British monarchy’s brutal record in the Caribbean and other parts of the world must be addres…]]></summary>

Elizabeth, Britain's longest-reigning monarch https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/life-queen-elizabeth-2022-09-08 and a towering presence on the world stage for 70 years, died on Thursday at her home in Scotland aged 96, drawing an outpouring of tributes https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/death-queen-elizabeth-marked-around-world…]]></summary>

"This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand," he said, calling for "the immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area".
