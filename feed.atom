        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico:  Trump says he’s received a target letter from special counsel Jack Smith’s Jan. 6 investigators 
It’s the clearest sign yet that Trump may soon face his third criminal indictment — this time for his effort to subvert the 2020 election results. 
Donald Trump said Tuesday he expects to be indicted by special counsel Jack Smith’s Jan. 6 grand jury, citing a “target letter” he received from investigators on Sunday. 
Such a letter “almost always means an arrest and indictment,” Trump, who has already been criminally indicted twice in recent months, wrote on Truth Social.

Update #1: Trump says he’s been informed he’s target of investigation into efforts to overturn 2020 election (AP)
 
Update #2: Trump told by special counsel he is criminal target in Jan. 6 probe (CNBC)

 
WNU Editor: These charges are serious. If convicted former President Trump could not only be barred from running, but should he win the Presidential election, he could be barred from assuming office.

The top U.S. military officer says Ukrainian forces have a “significant amount of combat power” that hasn’t yet been committed to the war 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian forces have a “significant amount of combat power” that hasn't yet been committed to the war, the top U.S. military officer said Tuesday, saying Kyiv is conserving some of its tactical effort while troops slowly work their way through deadly Russian minefields. 
Speaking to reporters after defense leaders from around the world met to discuss Ukraine's military needs, Army Gen.

WNU Editor: In the above video Gen. Mark Milley is saying that the majority of Ukraine's army's combat power has yet been committed to the war. My sources and contacts in Ukraine tell me otherwise. 
So who is right? You tell me. 
In the meantime there are numerous reports from Ukraine that Russia has launched a major offensive in the northeast part of Ukraine .... Russians concentrate on five fronts, Ukrainian forces continue offensive in the south – General Staff report (Ukrainska Pravda).]]></summary>

REUTERS/Stringer

 
Daily Mail: Kremlin blames Britain for orchestrating attack on Crimean bridge - and propagandist calls for retaliatory strike on Tower Bridge: Footage 'shows the moment Ukrainian drone attack hits crossing' 
* Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out Crimean bridge attack with help of UK 
* At least two people were killed in the suspected kamikaze drone attack 
The Kremlin today blamed Britain for orchestrating the deadly kamikaze drone strike that hit Vladimir Putin's £3billion bridge linking Russia to Crimea and sparked a fireball explosion. 
Dramatic footage appears to show the moment huge explosions ripped through the 12-mile crossing, with large flashes and thunderous blasts seen and heard from neighbouring towns. 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of carrying out the attack with the involvement of Britain and the US - without providing any evidence to support her outlandish claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: White House says it is Pentagon's 'sacred obligation' to help troops get abortions: Tears into Republicans and says U.S. military will 'lose talent' if access to the procedure is limited 
* Spokesman John Kirby on Monday defended Pentagon support for abortions 
* The policy is under fire from Sen. Tuberville who is blocking appointments 
* But Kirby said it was essential to recruiting the best personnel 
Hardline abortion restrictions in states such as Alabama are having an impact on morale in the U.S. military, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Monday, as he delivered an impassioned defense of Pentagon policies. 
It comes as Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, blocks hundred of senior military appointments in protest.

“So we don’t have nearly what we had at the heart of the Cold War. Now you add that we’re giving a lot of munitions away to the Ukrainians — which I think is exactly what we need to do — but now we’re getting dangerously low and sometimes, in some cases even too low that we don’t have enough,” said Gen. James Hecker.

Speaking on a panel with the air chiefs of the United Kingdom and Sweden during the Chief of the Air Staff’s Global Air & Space Chiefs’ Conference in London, USAFE Commander Gen. James Hecker, who also leads US air forces in Africa, urged fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization members to take a hard look at the status of their weapon stockpiles.

RT: New Ukrainian attack on Crimean Bridge: What we know so far 
A raid by two sea drones damaged a section of roadway and killed two civilians, according to Moscow 
Russia has accused Ukraine of staging another attack on the Crimean Bridge, which claimed the lives of two civilians and injured a child. The incident also resulted in considerable damage to one section of the roadway.
What happened?

In the early hours of Monday morning, Crimean Governor Sergey Aksyonov said traffic on the key link between the peninsula and mainland Russia had been stopped. At the time, he did not clarify the reason for the move, citing an unspecified “emergency.” 
Later, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov stated the incident had claimed the lives of a married couple from his region, adding that thei…]]></summary>

A Ukrainian security official has claimed Kyiv’s responsibility for an attack on the bridge linking the annexed Crimean peninsula to the Russian mainland – a vital supply line for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine and a personal project for President Vladimir Putin. 
The nearly 12-mile crossing, also known as the Kerch Bridge, is the longest in Europe and holds huge strategic and symbolic importance for Moscow. Monday’s attack on the bridge was the second since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, after a fuel tanker exploded while crossing it in October. 
A source in Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) told CNN this attack was a joint operation of the SBU and Ukraine’s naval forces. The source spoke on condition of anon…]]></summary>

Yahoo News: UK will be 'in a conflict' by 2030, outgoing defence secretary Ben Wallace suggests 
The UK will be "in a conflict" by the end of the decade, outgoing defence secretary Ben Wallace has suggested. 
Wallace has also expressed concern about what a "deeply wounded" Putin will do if Russia is defeated in the war he started in Ukraine. 
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Wallace announced he will quit the government when Rishi Sunak announces a ministerial reshuffle. This is expected in September. He will also stand down as an MP at next year’s general election.

The Tories are going to be destroyed in the next national election and the Ukraine war, especially with the failure of Ukraine's counteroffensive to make significant gains in the past 6 weeks, does not look promising.

SKY News: Ukraine has 'window of opportunity' this year to take back territory from Russia before 'war fatigue', says Czech Republic's president 
Ukraine has a "window of opportunity" this year to win back as much territory as possible from Russia because it will become harder to mount new operations and allies will start to suffer "war fatigue", the leader of the Czech Republic has told Sky News. 
President Petr Pavel, speaking on the sidelines of a major NATO summit, also said that a number of important elections in 2024, including in Ukraine, Russia and the United States, will create a "completely different situation" and he raised the prospect of a need for negotiations to end the fighting.

WNU Editor: This Ukrainian diplomat is upset. He believes Czech President Petr Pavel is revealing Western Secrets when he said support for Ukraine's war effort will close by the end of the year ....  Czech President’s statement at NATO event reveals Western secrets, claims Ukrainian diplomat (New Voice of Ukraine). 
I disagree.

What Czech President Petr Pavel said is not a secret. This blog revealed this news yesterday using open source information and from personal contacts in both Russia and Ukraine (link here).]]></summary>

Cohen said he expects that the Senate will either reject the amendments, or water them down enough to get the support needed to pass.
"We are, after all, trying to make sure that we fund our military, so it is dragging the military through the cultural wars," he said.
When asked what he says to the far-right Republicans who says the military has a "wokeness problem," Cohen suggested he would ask for a definition.
"What is wokeness? What does it mean? I said earlier today that it was Harry Truman, was he woke when he said we can no longer tolerate and accept the segregation of our military? That black men and women have an absolute equal right to serve in our military and serve together and not segregated?"

The fire started early in the morning near the village of Puntagorda in the north-west of the Canary Island. A lasting drought and high winds meant the fire spread quickly, according to the mayor of the village, Vicente Rodríguez, who spoke to state television broadcaster RTVE. 
Firefighters were unable to extinguish the flames as the wind kept changing direction. At least 11 houses burned down and an area of about 140 hectares was destroyed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.
The decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.
It was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of "permanent, irreversible harm" to the area.
The following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.
But the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister's granting of approval.
In a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps' successor Mark Harper said he was "satisfied" that the project's "harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits".
Opponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.
Steve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.
"This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it's not over yet," Gooding said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey on Friday spent a second day in the witness box at a London court, denying sexual assault charges and claiming the prosecution case against him was weak.
The two-time Oscar winner, 63, is on trial accused of sexually assaulting four men dating back more than 20 years, including when he was artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre.
The prosecution has claimed he was a "sexual bully" who reveled in making others feel uncomfortable, including by aggressively grabbing men's crotches.
Spacey began giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court in south London on Thursday, calling himself a "big flirt" but denying any aggressive behavior.
On Friday, he was questioned about one man who alleged that he drugged him and performed a sex act on him while he was asleep at hi…]]></summary>

The bill, which passed its second reading on Thursday, is part of an ultra-conservative, anti-Western drive that has intensified since the start of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine.
"I feel total despair," said Nikolai -- not his real name -- who spoke on condition that his identity not be revealed.
"If this law enters into force, even hormone therapy will be banned," he said.
The new legislation forbids transition surgery, with the exception of children with congenital defects, and outlaws people changing the registration of their gender in official documents.

Underground fires, which scientists believe started in a mine accident in 1916, create sinkholes that swallow people and homes. Coal pickers and activists report hundreds of people have died over the decades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dilma Mendes does not remember how many times she was arrested as a child. Her crime? Playing soccer in Brazil.
The country may be synonymous with the beautiful game, but it banned women from the sport for nearly four decades until 1979.
Ahead of the Women's World Cup starting next week in Australia and New Zealand, where Brazil will be in action, Mendes recalled the lengths she went to in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a soccer player.
As a girl in the 1970s, she gave ice cream to the boys she played with in Camacari in Brazil's impoverished northeast in exchange for an early warning of the arrival of police busting girls flouting the prohibition.
She used to dig a hole next to the pitch to hide in until the enforcers left, then crawled out again to continue kicking the ball aroun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Athens Acropolis, Greece's top tourist attraction, will close during the hottest hours on Friday as the country wilts under a heatwave, the culture minister announced.
Access to the UNESCO-listed archaeological site dating to antiquity will be suspended between midday and 5:00 pm (0900 GMT and 1400 GMT) before reopening "to protect workers and visitors", Lina Mendoni told public broadcaster ERT.
"It's highly likely that we will take the same measure tomorrow (Saturday)," the minister said.
Temperatures are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Athens on Friday and Saturday, but at the summit of the Acropolis human bodies feel much more heat, she added.
Other popular tourist sites surrounding the Sacred Rock on which the Acropolis stands, such as the Ancient Agora, will remain open.
The Acropolis, which has seen a major rise in visitor numbers in recent months, is normally open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.
A summer heatwave is hitting several Mediterranean countries, with forecasters predicting the mercury to soar past 40C in northern and western Greece.
The authorities have in recent days taken measures to cope. The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.
Shelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.
The authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.
Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke out against the blockade against hundreds of military appointments and promotions being waged by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
"Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?" asked Blitzer.
"He needs to lift the holdings," said Austin. "This is a national security issue, a readiness issue."
Tuberville, who refused to take Austin's call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.
"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?" asked Blitzer.
"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy," said Austin. "I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them."
"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?" asked Blitzer.
"That's our policy," said Austin.

"Put on your CIA director cap for a moment," said Tapper. "What do you think went through Putin's mind today when President Biden declared that Putin has already lost the war?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. 
Lashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.
His attorney said that he had been "eaten alive."
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates "do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door." 
“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions," she said. 
Clarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a "racial justice issue," citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doctors were able to complete a "miracle" surgery where they reattached a boy's head who had suffered an "internal decapitation" as a result of being hit by a car while he was riding his bike, Fox News reported.  
Suleiman Hassan, 12,  had his skull detached from the top vertebrae of his spine as a result of the accident. The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. 
When the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was "almost completely detached from the base of his neck." The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use "new plates and fixations in the damaged area." 
"Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room," Dr. Ohad Einav, said. 
Hassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. 
"The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing," Einav said.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-13T14:52:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kevin Spacey said Thursday he was a "big flirt" but denied any "aggressive" behavior as the Hollywood actor entered the witness box of his sexual assault trial in south London.
The Southwark Crown Court has earlier heard the testimony of four men, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accusing Spacey of sexual offenses between 2001 and 2013.
One complainant alleged the actor assaulted him multiple times and, in particular, grabbed him while he was driving Spacey to a party, nearly causing him to "come off the road".
Spacey in his testimony admitted to having touched the man but said "it didn't happen in a violent, aggressive, painful way".
"It was gentle... and it was, in my mind, romantic," Spacey, wearing a dark suit and glasses, told the jury.
Spacey claimed there was a mutual flirtatious relationship between them and described himself as a "big flirt".
But the alleged victim "made it clear that he did not want to go any further," the 63-year-old actor added.
Spacey said he felt "crushed" after the allegations were made against him, saying it was like a "stab in the back".
Asked about the testimony of another alleged victim, who accused Spacey of making crude remarks at a celebrity event before grabbing his crotch, Spacey described them as "madness".
"I never said any of the things that he claims I said to him and wouldn't and never have to anyone in my life," Spacey said.
He also claimed he didn't recognize the complainant when shown a photo of him.
Spacey, an Academy Award winner for "The Usual Suspects" and "American Beauty", was artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015.
He has denied three counts of indecent assault, seven counts of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
He has also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
The trial continues.]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
