Mr Sharma’s remarks come after the ruling Communist Party signed off on a third term for Xi - breaking an unofficial convention that limited leaders to two terms. 

“I think China’s more hawkish approach to the outside world is going to continue,” Mr Sharma told Sky News Australia. 

“I think their wolf warrior style of diplomacy and uncompromising attitudes towards the outside world are going to continue.”]]></summary>

“But then he loses the pardon power doesn’t he? To pardon his son Hunter Biden if he’s no longer president.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tweet by US President Joe Biden has been fact-checked on Twitter barely two days after Elon Musk finalised his $US44 billion takeover deal of the popular social networking service.

On Friday, the president was called out by Twitter readers for inflating the number of corporations that were making billions, according to Fox News.

In a tweet said to be giving "the facts", Mr Biden claimed that 55 corporations made $US40 billion in 2020 and "paid zero in federal taxes".

The tweet had an "added context" stamp applied to it by readers indicating the Inflation Reduction Act imposed a minimum tax on corporations with average pre-tax earnings greater than $US1 billion.

It also noted "of the 55 corporations mentioned by President Biden, only 14 had earnings greater than $1 billion and would be eligible under Biden’s tax law".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this photo released by the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen watches soldiers operate equipment during a visit to a naval station on Penghu, an archipelago of several dozen islands off Taiwan's western coast on Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2022. (Taiwan Ministry of National Defense via AP)   
StraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons 
Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. 
Defending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. 
Preventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.

WNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.

The same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.]]></summary>

   From Instapundit .... “Grab the popcorn, baby! It’s on! Maybe a questionable decision this early in his tenure as Chief Twit, but we’re here for the show, and we couldn’t write a better opening episode. This tweet would have gotten flagged for disinformation or taken down by Twitter in the before times. Now it’s out there in all its glory for people to read, debate, criticize, and all the other things that should happen in a free society where ideas are discussed with words INSTEAD of resorting to violence. It’s a new day!” 
Wow!!!! 
If this Santa Monica article is true (link here), it completely changes the narrative behind the Pelosi assault story.   This tweet by Elon Musk perfectly illustrates why the political establishment is freaking out over Elon Musk' ownership of Twitter.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asia Times: US chip ban de facto declaration of war on China?  
America’s latest chip war sanctions risk wider conflict in physical and economic spheres.  
The United States has gambled big in its latest across-the-board sanctions on Chinese companies in the semiconductor industry, believing it can kneecap China and retain its global dominance. 
From the slogans of globalization and “free trade” of the neoliberal 1990s, Washington has reverted to the technology-denial regimes that the US and its allies followed during the Cold War. While it might work in the short run to slow down Chinese advances, the cost to the US semiconductor industry of losing China – its biggest market – will have significant consequences in the long run. 
In the process, the semiconductor industries of Taiwan and S…]]></summary>

A Haitian politician has been shot dead outside his home, authorities have said, as international concerns intensify over the gang violence, political turmoil and humanitarian crises that have seized control of the country. 
Eric Jean Baptiste was killed on Friday night outside his home in the capital Port-au-Prince, local police told CNN.
He was the leader of the Rally of Progressive National Democrats Party (RNDP), a minor political party in Haiti, and launched a longshot presidential bid in 2016.  A security guard was also killed in the attack, the police spokesperson said. Baptiste survived an earlier attempt on his life in 2018, escaping with a bullet wound.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker in the Sea of Japan near Nakhodka, Russia. Vladimir Serebryanskiy/Dreamstime   
OilPrice.com: U.S. LNG Cannot Replace The Russian Natural Gas That Europe Has Lost 
* Europe has relied on U.S. LNG imports to offset the loss of Russian gas, with nearly 70% of U.S. LNG exports heading to Europe in September. 
* In the long term, Europe will have to find other sources of natural gas as its inventories are likely to drain over the upcoming winter. 
* Ultimately, Europe will have to reduce demand for natural gas going forward as there is very little available supply left. 
Europe cannot rely solely on imports of U.S. LNG to offset the pipeline gas supply it will have lost from Russia when it starts rebuilding inventories after the end of this winter, according to BloombergNEF. 
So far this year, American LNG has been crucial in meeting demand in Europe, which is scrambling for gas supply and willing to pay up for spot deliveries, outbidding most of Asia.
The United States is shipping record volumes of LNG to Europe to help EU allies and nearly 70% of all American LNG exports were headed to Europe in September, according to Refinitiv Eikon data cited by Reuters.

Update: Europe Can’t Rely on US Gas to Plug Growing Shortfall Next Year (Bloomberg)   
WNU Editor: I am sure the EU is going to be able to get the natural gas that it needs this winter. But it is not going to be cheap, nor reliable. And the bigger problem will be next year, since Russian gas will  no longer be available to fill up their reserves unless purchased through middle-men like Turkey or China at exoborant prices. 
And that is the crux of the problem. 
Europe's industrial base is dependent on having access to cheap natural gas. No more now.]]></summary>

* Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, said Twitter will have to “fly by our rules” after Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of the company. 
* Tech companies will face greater pressure to remove illegal content under the EU’s incoming Digital Services Act. 
* Companies can be fined up to 6% of global annual revenues for violations of the rules, which are expected to come into force in 2024. 
A top European Union official had a warning for Elon Musk Friday about his $44 purchase of Twitter, telling the billionaire he will have to play by the rules. 
After a cryptic tweet from Musk suggesting he’d completed his acquisition of Twitter, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, warned Musk that he will have to comply with the bloc’s new digital regulations. 
“The bird is freed,” Musk tweeted. In response, Breton quote-tweeted Musk saying: “In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.”

WNU Editor: This EU commissioner is sending a message to Elon Musk that they do not want people like Donald Trump back on the platform. 
In the end I think we will be seeing two types of Twitter. One for the EU, and another one for the rest of the world.

   The Cradle: ‘US has no plans to withdraw from Syria or end sanctions’: Official

 The Caesar Act, passed by Congress in 2019, imposes harsh sanctions against Syria and targets any state, business, or individual involved with the Damascus government.

Russia has announced it is suspending its involvement in the internationally-brokered deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its Black Sea ports. 
 It comes after Russia accused Ukraine of a "massive" drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea. 
Ukraine has not admitted the attack and President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Russian move "rather predictable". 
Without providing evidence, Russia also accused British troops of being involved in Saturday's attack. 
It also accused the UK of blowing up gas pipelines last month.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces have since released incredible footage purportedly from aboard several unmanned surface vessels used in the attack. The video shows the purported attack run on a guided missile frigate and Russian forces engaging the USVs with machine-gun fire.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's heated presidential race has tightened ahead of a Sunday vote, several opinion surveys showed on Saturday, with right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro eroding a slight advantage for leftist challenger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in most polls. 
Surveys by pollsters Datafolha and Quaest both showed Lula with 52% of valid votes against 48% for Bolsonaro, down from a 6 percentage-point lead three days prior, putting the incumbent in striking distance of a come-from-behind victory. 
A survey by pollster MDA showed Lula's edge slipping to just 2 percentage points, equal to the margin of error for the poll commissioned by transport sector lobby CNT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturday is chore day for me. Also helping this afternoon an elderly Ukrainian couple move to a home that a Ukrainian-Canadian family have opened for them to stay with them for a few months. Charity work never ends. 
Blogging will return this evening.
Just some final thoughts. 

The timing of the Sevastopol attack only hours after the Russian Ministry of Defense accused the UK of being responsible for damaging the Nord Stream pipeline attacks is bothering me on every level. 
This war is clearly escalating to an entirely new level. 
On another note. 
The Western narrative is saying that Russia is losing the war and Putin is facing great opposition within Russia itself. But what I see on the ground is the opposite. A rush from the West to supply more money and weapons to Ukraine, more sanctions, massive electrical black-outs in Ukraine, and now numerous reports from Russia of direct Western involvement in the war on the ground.  
We are also seeing a growing protest movement against EU policy towards the war (link here), and link here.
Something does not add up.]]></summary>

   WNU Editor: I suspect US drones are flying in the region 24/7. But optics is everything, and this has all the looks of being a coordinated attack by Ukraine and NATO against the Russian fleet at Sevastopol. 
There are now reports (yet to be confirmed) that some Russian warships were damaged in the attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BBC: 'Massive' drone attack on Black Sea Fleet - Russia 
Ukraine has carried out a "massive" drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, damaging one warship, Russia says.  Nine drones were used, a top official said. Ukraine has not commented. 
Without providing evidence, Russia accused British troops of being involved in that attack - and in blowing up gas pipelines last month. 
The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was "peddling false claims of an epic scale."  Saturday's attack comes as Ukrainian troops successfully retake territory occupied by occupying Russians. 
Russia has replied by launching large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly on the country's energy grid.

KYIV — Large parts of the Ukrainian capital have been experiencing rolling blackouts in recent weeks, after increased Russian attacks over the past month that have destroyed an estimated 30% of Ukraine’s power and heating generation capacity. 
Kyiv has accused Russia, which continues to suffer a string of embarrassing setbacks on the battlefield, of pursuing a determined strategy of targeting such facilities in order both to increase Ukrainian refugee flows into Europe and to freeze the population at home into submission.
Ukraine’s power stations and electricity distribution network have also been heavily bombed in the past few weeks. On Oct. 22, a thermal power station in Lutsk, in Ukraine’s northwest, was hit by three Russian cruise missiles, according to the city’s mayor, Ihor Polishchuk, leading to critical damage.

Breaking Defense:  Boeing defense racks up $2.8B in costs this quarter, with losses from KC-46 and new Air Force One  
“We’re not embarrassed by [the cost overruns]; they are what they are. And we intend to deliver against these contracts and satisfy our customers,” said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.  
WASHINGTON — Boeing disclosed a whopping $2.8 billion loss on defense programs this quarter, led by significant cost overruns on the KC-46 tanker and new Air Force One, the company stated today. 
Losses were sustained on KC-46, T-7A Red Hawk trainer, the Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone, VC-25B — better known as Air Force One, when the president is onboard — and NASA’s Commercial Crew program, Boeing said in a news release. 
The overruns were “driven by higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs, as well as technical challenges” and “were also impacted by unfavorable performance on other programs,” Boeing said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stated Taiwan is an inherent part of China and accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of provoking the Taiwan-China conflict on Thursday. 
At the 19th annual meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in Moscow, Putin was asked about his position on Taiwan. The Russian president responded, “Taiwan indubitably is an inherent part of the People’s Republic of China and this is the position we’ve always adhered to. 
It remains unchanged.”   “The provocative gestures, such as the visits to Taiwan by the U.S. highest dignitaries, are seen in Russia as nothing but a provocation. Why do that? Honestly, I cannot answer that,” the Russian president said.

SCMP: China brushes off US request to resume military dialogues 
* US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin had called for contacts to restart, after China cut off exchanges in retaliation for US House speaker's visit to Taiwan in August 
* But US should 'respect China's interests and major concerns and remove the negative factors that impede the development of ties', a military spokesman says 
The US needs to respect China's interests and concerns if it is serious about reopening military communications, a Chinese military spokesman said on Thursday. 
Contact has been cut off since August, after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan over Beijing's protests. Responding to US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin's recent call for China to resume contact, Tan Kefei, a spokesman for China's defence ministry, said that Washington bore all blame.

Businesslend: BASF to downsize 'permanently' in Europe 
BASF has stated it should downsize “permanently” in Europe, with excessive power prices making the area more and more uncompetitive.

WNU Editor: BASF downsizing its operations in Europe and moving elsewhere is a shock.

EurAsian Times: Ukraine War: Russia’s ‘Indigenous & Inexpensive’ UAVs Bring Ukrainian Counter Offensive To A Grinding Halt 
Since October 10, 2022, when Russia retaliated fiercely against the Ukrainian intelligence-masterminded terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge, world attention has been riveted on the Russian use of inexpensive Geran-2 drones. 
Russia has used the Iranian-designed drones, which reportedly cost under $20,000/- a pop, to effortlessly knock out 40% of Ukraine’s power generation infrastructure, despite Western-supplied MANPADS and AWACS support. 
Even as Ukraine and its Western curators are struggling to put together an effective counter to the Geran 2 drone, Russia has escalated its use of inexpensive drones, this time all along the frontline where Russian forces have brought the Ukrainian counteroffensive to a grinding halt, well before its stated aims could be realized.

WNU Editor: There are many reasons why Ukraine's counter-offensives have stalled. Supply lines and lack of supplies/fortified Russian positions backed by more reinforcements and superior artillery fire/lack of trained manpower/etc.. But Russian drones have definitely had an impact, from detecting Ukraine military movements to knocking out a good portion of Ukraine's electrical grid. 
I also see the Russian military copying the same drone tactics that Azerbaijan used in their last war with Armenia. Armenian forces were dug in and reinforced, but Azerbaijan's drones made mincemeat out of them using Turkish-supplied drones, as well as knocking out Armenian reinforcements that were then sent in.]]></summary>

— Jeff B. is *BOX OFFICE POISON* (@EsotericCD) October 27, 2022
   USA Today: Exclusive poll: Republican support rises ahead of Election Day, with inflation driving voters  
After SCOTUS reversed Roe v. Wade, some Democrats thought the issue would disrupt typical midterm factors like views of the economy. But the new poll shows many voters going back to basics. 
 * Voters overwhelmingly view the election as a way to send a message to the White House. 
 *  Biden's upbeat reassurances on the economy aren't breaking through with voters. 
 * Asked whether inflation or abortion mattered more to them, respondents chose inflation by 56%-40%. 
Republicans are resurgent as the midterm campaign heads into its final stretch, an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, amid angst about President Joe Biden's leadership and the nation's economy. 
As Americans feel the bite of inflation in their daily lives, from eating out less often to canceling vacations, voters overwhelmingly view the election as a way to send a message to the White House – and by double digits, that message is to change course.

WNU Editor: I tell my Republican friends to not get cocky. President Trump was polling similar numbers in 2020 ..... 40% of Hispanics and 21% of Blacks backing Republican candidates .... but the polls were wrong and he lost the election that also ended with the Democrats winning the House and Senate.]]></summary>

Since Facebook rebranded as Meta in 2021, the social media giant has increasingly focused on connecting the digital and physical worlds through augmented reality.  However, a company shareholder recently sent a letter to the CEO calling the metaverse investment “super-sized and terrifying.”
It didn’t take long for these concerns to be justified.  Meta released its third quarter financial results after the October 26 bell and, perhaps unsurprisingly, its metaverse division underperformed.  Meta’s Reality Labs lost $3.672 billion in the quarter, mirroring a similar decline in the first quarter.  This is the risk you run when you venture into uncharted territory.

Chinese refiners have increased their crude oil purchases ahead of the year’s end as they see higher fuel exports in the final months of the year. 
According to Bloomberg, Chinese companies have bought at least 10 million barrels of crude over the past week, mostly from the Middle East, West Africa, and Brazil, signaling the demand situation has changed for the better. 
One of the main reasons for this demand optimism is the global diesel shortage.

Update #2: This top US banker is right .... Jamie Dimon Says “We are getting energy completely wrong” and He's Right (Mish Talk). 
Update #3: US Diesel supplies continue to fall, and prices continue to climb .... Gas prices down again, diesel higher (DRGNews). Pray for warm weather.]]></summary>

Outrage over her killing has led to protests worldwide – women chopped off their hair and many Muslim women burned their hijabs.
