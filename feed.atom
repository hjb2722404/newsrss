        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[Sponsored Article]  When the first intake of pupils arrived at Harrow International School Hong Kong back in 2012, they were no doubt experiencing the usual mixed sensations of anxiety and hope.   They were entering the unfamiliar environment of a brand-new boarding school, which sought to blend the traditional principles of a British-style education with aspects of international learning and culture found in one of Asia’s most dynamic cities.   But they knew too that with top-class facilities, a good balance of academic and extracurricular activities, and a house system providing pastoral support and a sense of community, they would have all kinds of opportunities to flourish and find their own direction in life.   For four senior members of that first group, who graduated in 2014, the school’s 10th anniversary, which happens to coincide with the 450th anniversary of the sister school in the UK, is a good time to look back on those early days, reflecting on the different paths they have taken and just how far they have come.   Chloe Choi, for instance, went on to study veterinary medicine at the University of Glasgow, then worked for a year in a small animal general practice, and is now a laboratory veterinarian at Hong Kong University’s Centre of Comparative Medicine.   There, she works with a team of six vets, managing and monitoring the animals and providing advice and training for researchers conducting experimental projects.    Still, though, she has vivid memories of her time at Harrow: singing alto in the choir, taking piano, hip-hop dance, tennis and yoga lessons; organising sports day; and running orientation days plus tours for prospective parents.     “Being a weekly boarder definitely helped me to open up and be more social,” Choi says. “And the summer placement programme was a great way to gain work experience and useful insights into what careers related to your chosen university subject would involve. I was panicking a bit before applying, but I spent two weeks at a small…]]></summary>

NBC: The Navy has fired a dozen leaders but won't explain why  
A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including five in one week, the Navy said.
 The Navy has fired nearly a dozen officers in leadership positions in less than three months, including five in one week, due to a “loss of confidence” in their ability to command — an unusual string of terminations across land, air and sea teams, experts said.  At least nine commanding officers and two senior advisers have been relieved of their duties since April, when a cluster of suicides on the USS George Washington warship sparked widespread concerns of a mental health crisis.  A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including 12 in the Navy and one in the Marine Corps, the Navy said. Most recently, four Naval commanding officers and a top leader were ousted from June 8 to June 14.

Lithuania has begun a ban on the rail transit of goods subject to European Union sanctions to the Russian far-western exclave of Kaliningrad, transport authorities in the Baltic nation said on June 18. 
The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials, and advanced technology. 
Anton Alikhanov, the governor of the Russian oblast, said the ban would cover around 50 percent of the items that Kaliningrad imports. 
Alikhanov said the region, which has an ice-free port on the Baltic Sea, will call on Russian federal authorities to take tit-for-tat measures against the EU country for imposing the ban. He said he would also seek to have more goods sent by ship to the oblast.

The catastrophic economic consequences of the 'western' proxy war with Russia are setting in. As a result the high inflation, caused by supply side constrains due to sanctions and far too much spending, will ruin the middle classes of many countries. 
To those who did not wear blinders and who knew of the real economies of the 'west' and Russia this was very predictable and predicted:   
The U.S. is pushing its European 'allies' to commit economic suicide by sanctioning everything Russia. The U.S. should be more careful. It is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil and its aircraft industry depends on titanium from Russia. Russia surely knows who is trying to hurt it the most and it surely knows how, and has the means to, hurt back. 
The hurt has not at all reached its peak. This winter will be very difficult for Europe. Poor countries are even worse off. Many will experience hunger crises and riots.

WNU Editor: I have a different point of view. Many of America's adversaries see a very weak White House, and they are taking advantage of the situation. The US is not in charge, and they are now mostly reacting to ongoing events rather than shaping them.]]></summary>

Receiving signals from extraterrestrial civilizations could pose an existential risk. Really.
 Humans have invented a rogue’s gallery of nightmarish fictional aliens over the decades: acid-blooded xenomorphs who want to eat us and lay their eggs in our chest cavities; Twilight Zone Kanamits who want to fatten us up like cows and eat us; those lizard creatures in the 1980s miniseries V who want to harvest us for food. (You may be sensing a theme here.) 
But the most frightening vision isn’t an alien being at all — it’s a computer program.

CNBC: China’s Xi says trade with Russia expected to hit new records in the coming months 
* “Today our cooperation between Russia and China are rising,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to an official English translation carried by Russian state broadcaster RT. 
* “Trade over the first half of this year has been [in the tens of billions of U.S. dollars] and we can expect new records in upcoming months, which is a testament to the great cooperation between our two nations,” Xi said. 
* The Chinese leader was speaking via video at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum’s plenary session, which Russian President Vladimir Putin opened with a speech over an hour long. 
BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday emphasized his country’s commitment to trading with Russia, despite Western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. 
“Today our cooperation between Russia and China [is] rising,” Xi said, according to an official English translation carried by Russian state broadcaster RT. He cited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Beijing in early February. 
“Trade over the first half of this year has been [in the tens of billions of U.S. dollars] and we can expect new records in upcoming months, which is a testament to the great cooperation between our two nations,” Xi said.
