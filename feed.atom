        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson conducted a much-hyped interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week that mostly consisted of Putin lecturing Carlson about Russian history while barely letting him get a word in.
However, Financial Times Moscow Bureau Chief Max Seddon singled out one particular part of the interview that had to be particularly embarrassing for Carlson, which came when the Russian president mocked him for getting rejected to work at the CIA decades ago.
"We should thank God that they didn't let you in!" Putin said to Carlson. "Although it is a serious organization, I understand."

Seddon noted that Putin embarrassed Carlson despite the fact that Carlson had gone out of his way to lob softball questions at him while also in the past praising his nation for supposedly upholding traditional Christian values.
"The way Putin casually humiliates one of his most prominent and sympathetic interlocutors in the west here, after state media and the Kremlin spent ages praising him, is just brutal," Seddon posted on Twitter. "Classic cheap power move."
Carlson has frequently parroted Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine over the years, and at one point even went so far as to say he was rooting for Russian to win the conflict.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain's Prince Harry on Friday settled a long-running lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) but vowed to continue his legal battles with several other UK media outlets.
The Duke of Sussex sued MGN -- which publishes The Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People tabloids -- alleging its journalists were linked to deceptive and unlawful methods, including phone hacking.
A High Court judge ruled in the prince's favour in December, concluding phone hacking had been "widespread and habitual" at MGN titles in the late 1990s and the duke's phone had been tapped to a "modest extent".
Judge Timothy Fancourt awarded him £140,600 ($177,300) in damages, after finding evidence of these practices in 15 of the 33 sample articles that Harry had submitted in the case.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said about 5,500 liters of both contaminated and filtered water leaked when a valve was left open during cleaning. The company, which said it discovered the leak on Wednesday morning, warned that some of the water—which is believed to contain 220 times the level of radioactivity required for government reporting—may have seeped into the ground.

"We talk a lot here about 'PCT': pre-carnival tension, which every samba school performer feels," says the smiling, elegant Gaspar, a 30-year-old member of Unidos de Vila Isabel, one of 12 schools that will compete in Rio's famed carnival parade competition Sunday and Monday nights.
"Carnival is here" is one of Rio's favorite catch-phrases. The iconic beach city has been criss-crossed for weeks by "blocos," the street parties that draw throngs of revelers in alternately skimpy and extravagant costumes this time of year, drun…]]></summary>

The title of the exhibition "My Verses Are Like Dynamite", at the Jewish Museum Berlin from Friday, is taken from one of the anti-fascist issues produced by Bloch between August 1943 and April 1945.

The ceremony came as pressure grows for European and US museums and institutions to restore African artefacts stolen during the rule of former colonial powers Britain, France, Germany and Belgium.
The Ghana royal treasures from the Fowler Museum, including a gold necklace, an ornamental chair and an elephant tail whisk, were presented during a ceremony of chiefs at the Manhyia Palace in the city of Kumasi in the Ashanti region.

People prepare to celebrate Lunar New Year in many Asian countries including China and Taiwan; senior high school students celebrate graduation in Seoul, South Korea; fans cheers for a K-pop band in Jakarta, Indonesia; Kashmiri Muslim devotees pray during Mehraj-u-Alam, believed to mark Prophet Muhammad’s ascension to heaven; and Indian Hindu devotees prepare for the Magh Mela fair in Prayagraj, India.

Muslim grooms sit waiting for their brides in a mass wedding in Ahmedabad, India; people grieve after a landslide in Macao town, Philippines; England competes in a cricket match against India; and badminton players compete in a tournament in Bangkok.

This photo gallery highlights some of the most compelling images in the Asia-Pacific region made or published by The Associated Press in the past week.

The selection was curated by AP photo editor Shuji Kajiyama in Tokyo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) offered "praise" for Tucker Carlson because she said he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin "just to get the truth out" about the war on Ukraine.
"But what's happening with that war and the numbers that you're speaking of is a true, unbelievable tragedy on a massive proportion," Greene told right-wing podcast host Steve Bannon on Thursday. "And to think that our tax dollars were spent on basically just grinding down an entire generation of Ukrainian men, no wonder they don't want to serve."
Greene insisted that "America deserves answers" about the war.

"And I have to praise Tucker Carlson for going to Russia and being willing to interview Vladimir Putin just to get the truth out, just to get the story out, and let the American people decide for themselves," she said.
The lawmaker acknowledged that Putin might not tell the truth.
"It doesn't mean we have to believe everything he says, but we should be able to hear from him," she insisted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.K. sale of sets, costumes and props from the hit Netflix drama "The Crown" was due to end Thursday after several showpiece items smashed estimates and netted tens of thousands of pounds.
Hundreds of items -- from a signed script to a sports car -- featured in the award-winning show went under the hammer in a two-day London auction that included a live sale Wednesday.
That saw a 1987 green Jaguar XJ-SC Cabriolet, used in "The Crown" to portray a similar model owned by Princess Diana, fetch £70,250 ($88,600) -- the highest-priced sale at the auction staged by Bonhams.
It was more than four times the low estimate price set by the auctioneers.

FBI agents disrupted a plot by three men – two of whom said they were part of a militia – to travel to the Texas-Mexico border to kill Border Patrol agents and immigrants crossing illegally because they believed the country was being invaded, according to court documents filed in federal courts.

"The first reaction was confusion, then outrage, when we realised what had happened here," Boryano Rickum, chief librarian for Tempelhof-Schoeneberg district, told AFP.
The incident -- the work of a single suspect -- was not however a one off.
The library at Berlin's Technical University is also thought to have been targeted by far-right vandalism, while elsewhere extremists have crashed events and threatened staff.
The cases illustrate what campaigners call a "cultural struggle" as extremist ideas gain purchase and the far-right climbs in the polls.

Barbara Gorecka, 69, runs a bat sanctuary in the residential building where she lives and says she has now taken care of around 1,600 animals.
"It all started exactly 16 years ago, on a very cold January... It was when bats started emerging out of the ventilation ducts into my apartment," Gorecka told AFP in her flat as bats chirped and fluttered around her.
She currently keeps around three dozen bats that are sick or injured, or have abruptly woken up from hibernation.
"It's mostly bats that are exhausted that end up here, those that have been woken up -- for example, by fireworks," she said.

Live video images of the crack in the Earth's surface, stretching an estimated three kilometers (two miles), showed the fissure illuminating plumes of smoke rising under the dark sky that was visible from the capital of Reykjavik.
The site is around 40 kilometers southwest of Reykjavik, in the same area as two previous eruptions, the first on December 18 and the second on January 14 -- near the fishing village of Grindavik.

"The CEC (Central Election Commission) refused to register my candidacy for the post of president of the Russian Federation," Nadezhdin said, adding that he would appeal against the decision at Russia's supreme court.

	"And what we're seeing with shows like yours, Jack, and Real America's Voice and some of these others we've mentioned, and Tucker is an entire interview," Lake told host Jack Posobiec. "But you can then watch the interview as it played out and make your own assessment of the facts."


	Lake said Americans "deserve to have answers" about aid provided for Ukraine to fight a Russian invasion.

	"All of that and none of us in America are able to find out what Russia's stance on this whole thing is," she remarked. "We only can get what the fake news wants to tell us."

 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
