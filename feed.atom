        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A book about the British Royals has been pulled from shelves in the Netherlands amid reports it identifies a family member at the centre of a racism row.

Omid Scobie's new book 'Endgame' has been taken off shelves after potentially revealing a Royal member who had concerns over how dark Prince Archie’s skin might be.

The “racist” scandal dates back to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s controversial 2021 Oprah Winfrey interview.

The person involved was never named as Prince Harry felt it would be “very damaging to them.”

Publishers of the Dutch translation say sales of the book are on hold temporarily.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Middle East adviser to the Pentagon Jasmine El-Gamal says the alleged death of a 10-month-old hostage is a tragic incident and won’t derail Israel’s ultimate objective of trying to get as many hostages home. 

“Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated again and again that his number one objective from day one … has been to get the hostages out, as many hostages as possible,” Ms El-Gamal told Sky News Australia.

“It’s a tragic incident if it is true, but I don’t see it derailing the ultimate, larger objective of trying to get every hostage home.”

Ms El-Gamal’s remarks come after Hamas reported that the 10-month-old baby, the youngest hostage held in Gaza, was killed alongside his mother and brother in an Israeli airstrike. 

The claims are yet to be verified and are being investigated by Israel's Defence Force.]]></summary>

The keen runner and surfer was one of the nine children held hostage in Gaza yet to be freed under the truce deal.

His sister Mika, who is currently in Australia as part of the visiting Israeli delegation said she is “beyond happy.”

The delegation made up of family members held hostage by Hamas is pushing the Albanese government to make more noise on the world stage to help get more hostages released.

Amit Shani’s release comes as Israel has agreed to extend the truce by one day for every 10 militant-held hostages who are freed. 

The cease-fire, which was originally set to expire on Monday, has paused the deadliest fighting between Israel and Palestine in decades.]]></summary>

Daily Mail: Top CIA official posted pro-Palestine picture on Facebook two weeks after Hamas' terror attack on Israel as Biden faces mutiny from within 
 * Top intelligence chief changed profile pic to Palestinian flag two weeks after the October 7 attack that claimed 1,200 Israeli lives 
 * Previously she had posted a selfie with the words 'Free Palestine' superimposed 
 * Comes as hundreds of White House officials reject President Biden's official line  and demand ceasefire in Gaza 
A growing revolt within the Biden administration at his handling of the Israel-Hamas war has reached the top ranks of the CIA after a top analysis chief changed her Facebook profile to a Palestinian flag. 
More than 400 administration staff signed an anonymous letter earlier this month demanding the President seek an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. 
Another 1,000 employed by the US Agency for International Development echoed the call, but State Department officials have refused to crack down on the dissent, instead holding 'listening sessions' with staff as unrest grows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Justice Department announced charges against an Indian man who's accused of directing an assassination plot. 
Nikhil "Nick" Gupta was charged on Wednesday after an Indian government employee who works on security and intelligence encouraged him to take out a Sikh activist who supports a sovereign state in northern India, the Department of Justice said.
The defendant conspired from India to assassinate, right here in New York City, a U.S. citizen of Indian origin who has publicly advocated for the establishment of a sovereign state for Sikhs," said Manhattan prosecutor Damian Williams in a statement.
It's the second such incident announced in the past week. According to President Joe Biden's administration, investigators foiled another plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States.
Among the most startling details in the Justice Department's statement is an alleged revelation from Gupta to an undercover DEA agent that another Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, "was also the target." 
In fact, he revealed, "We have so many targets."

Sikh groups, including some active in the United States and Canada, have vocally advocated for their own state to be parsed out of India. 
The Diplomat detailed leaked Pakistani documents it says point to an assassination program being orchestrated by India, though the site claimed the leak is attempting to capitalize on India's negative publicity. 
The Intercept's report last week also cited the same intelligence assessment, saying that the Indian government's "Research and Analysis Wing" has been plotting a global assassination plot in several countries in a coordinated effort to target Sikh and Kashmiri activists abroad.

CNN: Gang violence spreading to Haiti’s rural reaches, UN report says 
A UN report released Tuesday details a wave of violence that has swept Haiti’s rural reaches, describing gang raids on villages and alarming levels of food insecurity caused by the targeting of farmers in the country’s historic breadbasket. 
The report, from the UN Human Rights Office and the UN Integrated Office in Haiti, offers a stark analysis of the spread of gangs in the poor Caribbean nation, which has seen deepening unrest since the 2021 assassination of then-President Jovenel Moise.
Past attention has largely focused on Port-au-Prince, the capital, where warring gangs have forced thousands of people from their homes and into makeshift encampments across the sprawling city. In Bas-Artibonite, the focus of the UN report and the center of Haitian rice production located some 100 kilometers from the capital, there are now more than 20 “extremely violent” criminal groups fighting for turf, it says. Some 1,690 people were killed, injured, or kidnapped from January 2022 through last month, the report also says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since Hamas's deadly October 7 attack on southern Israel, the father of 17-year-old hostage Mia Leimberg had been praying for her safe release from captivity in Gaza -- and the return of the family pet.
To Moshe Leimberg's great joy, his daughter was finally freed on Tuesday as part of a group of hostages 12 -- 10 Israelis and two Thais -- that also included her mother and aunt.
And the release of the hostages under an agreement to pause fighting between Israel and Hamas also solved the mystery of what happened to Mia's pet dog Bella.
At the time of the Palestinian militant group's attack, the dog had been with Mia on the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Yitzhak, where she and her mother Gabriela had been visiting her aunt.
Leimberg searched for the fluffy white dog in the aftermath of the assault -- in which around 240 hostages were taken, Israeli officials say -- hoping it would be a comfort for his daughter when she finally returned, Israeli daily Israel Hayom reported.
The fate of the animal became clear on Tuesday when pictures were beamed around the world of Mia -- flanked by masked and armed fighters from Hamas and militant group the Islamic Jihad -- being handed over to Red Cross officials.
She was carrying Bella in her arms, which it now appears was with her all along.
Israeli officials say the Hamas attack on October 7 killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians.
In response, Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and has unleashed an air and ground campaign that the Hamas government says has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians.

The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, already extended for two days with the prospect of a further extension being discussed, has seen the Palestinian militant group release dozens of hostages in return for Israel freeing some 180 Palestinian prisoners. 
Among the Palestinians released so far is 17-year-old Ahmed Abu Na'im, who served 12 months in jail for, he says, throwing stones during clashes with Israeli security forces at a protest. Israel charged him with throwing stones as well as "a bomb or incendiary device," which he denies. It was his third arrest in one year. 
"They arrest people randomly," Na'im told CBS News in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the larger of the two Palestinian territories. "They accused (me) of things I did not commit."

North Korea claimed its first spy satellite put into space, which was launched into orbit last week, has taken photos of the White House, Pentagon and nearby US naval stations. 
The prominent US sites add to a list of areas North Korea claims to have photographed using its reconnaissance probe that was launched on Nov. 21. 
The state’s official media said leader Kim Jong Un has seen the latest images along with previous photos of Rome, Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, Pearl Harbor and the US Navy’s Carl Vinson aircraft carrier. 
South Korea salvaged one of North Korea’s spy satellites after a failed launch earlier this year and concluded the technology had little value as a reconnaissance probe. 
While Seoul believes any North Korean satellite would be rudimentary at best, such technology could help Kim’s regime in its targeting as it steps up its ability to deliver a nuclear strike.

Israel-Gaza war
On October 7, hundreds of Hamas gunmen pour across the border from Gaza, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage in the worst attack in Israel's history, traumatizing the country and stunning the world.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to "destroy" Hamas and Israel launches air bombardments followed by a ground offensive that reduces entire neighborhoods in the densely packed Palestinian territory to rubble.
As Gaza's destruction and death toll mount, international pressure grows on Israel to pause it's offensive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis presided over his weekly audience Wednesday despite the flu that caused him to scrap a trip to Dubai, but asked an aide to deliver his reading for him.
The Argentine pontiff, 86, looked tired and sounded breathless as he told the audience at the Vatican that "I'm still not well with this flu".
Francis, who had part of a lung removed when he was younger, was forced Tuesday to cancel his scheduled trip to key UN climate talks, following advice from his doctors.
The pope had been due to travel to Dubai from Friday to Sunday, but is suffering from an inflammation of the respiratory tract, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.
Francis spoke at the end of Wednesday's audience to call for an end to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, wheezing as he did so.
But he looked cheered by a circus performance put on for him, complete with acrobats on roller skates.
And before the general audience he told visiting members of the Celtic football club that he was feeling "better than yesterday".
The pope, who turns 87 next month, has suffered a series of health issues in recent years, from knee and hip pain to an inflamed colon and most recently, hernia surgery in June.
He was also hospitalized for three nights in March with bronchitis, which was cured with antibiotics.
On Saturday, he cancelled events due to what the Vatican called "light flu symptoms".
It said that a CT scan had ruled out "risks of pulmonary complications" and Francis was receiving antibiotics intravenously.

Those who step through the gate to the cluster of buildings on the other side are entering place that styles itself a country, complete with its own flag, laws, currency and ID cards.
The so-called Kingdom of Germany was founded by former chef and karate teacher Peter Fitzek, who anointed himself as "king" in 2012 in an elaborate ceremony complete with a crown and scepter.
Fitzek and his followers are part of a movement known as the Reichsbuerger (Citizens of the Reich), a loose grouping of in some cases violent extremists and conspiracy theorists who reject the legitimacy of the modern German republic.

Stories emerging from those freed from Gaza - mostly through their relatives - paint a picture of weeks spent in squalor, uncertainty and fear.

Deborah Cohen claimed her 12-year-old nephew was made to watch videos of the Hamas rampage through southern Israel.

Zero Hedge/Epoch Times: US Spends Billions On Overseas Wars, But Who Really Benefits? 
Fears over incentivizing global conflicts are rising as the Biden administration requests more than $105 billion in supplemental security spending. 
The administration says the money, primarily for Israel and Ukraine, will be good for the economy. 
President Joe Biden has described the mammoth spending package as “a smart investment” that will “pay dividends” to U.S. security interests. 
Likewise, Assistant Secretary of State James O’Brien described the supplemental as “a very good bargain.” 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the money will “flow through our defense industrial base, creating American jobs in more than 30 states.”

Temporary closure comes after Finnish intelligence suggested Russia was helping asylum seekers reach the border 
Finland has announced it is temporarily closing its entire border with Russia after weeks of tensions between the countries over asylum seekers that Helsinki has labelled a “hybrid operation” by Moscow. 
With just 24 hours’ notice, the Finnish government said on Tuesday it would close Raja-Jooseppi in Lapland, its last remaining border crossing point with Russia, on Wednesday night. 
The highly unusual move, which follows the closure of its eight other crossing points, means the entirety of the 830-mile land border between Finland and Russia will be closed until 13 December.

"I am completely relieved and happy as 41 trapped laborers in the Silkyara Tunnel Collapse have been successfully rescued," Minister of Road Transport Nitin Gadkari said in a statement. "This was a well-coordinated effort by multiple agencies, marking one of the most significant rescue operations in recent years."

But a review of past conflicts and interviews with casualty and weapons experts suggest that Israel’s assault is different. 
While wartime death tolls will never be exact, experts say that even a conservative reading of the casualty figures reported from Gaza shows that the pace of death during Israel’s campaign has few precedents in this century. 
People are being killed in Gaza more quickly, they say, than in even the deadliest moments of U.S.-led attacks in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, which were themselves widely criticized by human rights groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, former President Donald Trump has avoided agreeing with intelligence assessments that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered on his behalf during the 2016 presidential election.
Most infamously, Trump rejected the American intelligence community's assessment about Russia's actions at a press conference in Helsinki, Finland where he stood next to Putin and said, "President Putin says it's not Russia, I don't see any reason why it would be."
But it seems that Trump will actually blame Putin for 2016 election interference if doing so will help keep him out of prison.
Politico's Kyle Cheney flags a legal filing by Trump's attorneys this week in which they dispute special counsel Jack Smith's claims that Trump has damaged Americans' faith in the electoral system by essentially arguing that Putin did it first.
"The Special Counsel's Office falsely alleges that President Trump 'eroded public faith in the administration of the election,'" the filing states. "The 2016 [Intelligence Community Assessment] uses strikingly similar language to attribute the origins of that erosion to foreign influence -- that is, foreign efforts to 'undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.'"
The filing went on to argue that "President Trump is entitled to the detailed information supporting the conclusions in the 2016 Election ICA... in order to demonstrate to a jury that he did not create or cause the environment that the prosecution seeks to blame him for."
What Trump's lawyers leave out is the fact that Trump openly encouraged Russia to hack political rival Hillary Clinton's email server and release her private communications.
When Russia eventually leaked hacked emails from Clinton's campaign to WikiLeaks, Trump eagerly promoted them while on the campaign trail as evidence of Clinton's purported corruption.]]></summary>

Wilders, whose stunning general election win on Wednesday sent shock waves through the Netherlands and the whole of Europe, put forward a fresh candidate for a "scout" to oversee the coalition horse-trading.
His first appointment, Gom Van Strien, was forced to step down on Monday following allegations of fraud at a previous company. "Not my dream start," admitted Wilders.
After a brief meeting of top party leaders, Wilders' new candidate, former Labour Party education minister Ronald Plasterk, won "broad support", according to Lower House chairwoman Vera Bergkamp.

RFE: Officials Confirm Wife Of Ukrainian Military Intelligence Chief Budanov, Others Poisoned 
KYIV -- Ukrainian officials have confirmed reports that Marianna Budanova, the wife of the chief of the country's military intelligence service, had been poisoned with "heavy metals" and is in hospital for treatment, in what appears to represent the most serious targeting of a family member of Ukraine's leadership since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. 
Andriy Yusov, an official at the GUR military intelligence agency, confirmed earlier media reports on November 28 that Budanova, the wife of Kyrylo Budanov, had fallen ill and is under treatment for poisoning. 
"Marianna Budanova was indeed poisoned by heavy metals. She is now undergoing a course of treatment, which is already coming to an end," Yusov told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.

The two leaders were due to hold talks midday Tuesday in London, where Mitsotakis has been visiting since Sunday, before news of their axing emerged late Monday amid an apparent spat over the so-called Elgin Marbles.
"I would like to express my displeasure at the British Prime Minister's cancellation of our meeting just a few hours before it was due to take place," the Greek leader said in a brief statement.
He reportedly declined a UK offer to meet Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden instead.
A Downing Street spokesperson said "the UK-Greece relationship is hugely …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Monday she was quitting Elon Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which she described as a "global sewer" and a tool to disrupt democracy.
"I've made the decision to leave X," Hidalgo said in an op-ed in French newspaper Le Monde. "X has in recent years become a weapon of mass destruction of our democracies", she wrote.
The 64-year-old Socialist, who unsuccessfully stood for the presidency in 2022, joined Twitter as it was then known in 2009 and has been a frequent user of the platform.
She accused X of promoting "misinformation", "anti-Semitism and racism."
"The list of abuses is endless", she added. "This media has become a vast global sewer."
Since Musk took over Twitter in 2022, a number of high-profile figures said they were leaving the popular social platform, but there has been no mass exodus.
Several politicians including EU industry chief Thierry Breton have announced that they are opening accounts on competing networks in addition to maintaining their presence on X.
The City of Paris account will remain on X, the mayor's office told AFP.
By contrast, some organisations have taken the plunge, including the US public radio network NPR, or the German anti-discrimination agency.
Hidalgo has regularly faced personal attacks on social media including Twitter, as well as sometimes criticism over the lack of cleanliness and security in Paris.

But a historian who has analysed the new evidence says he has “serious doubts” about her alleged membership in La Résistance, suggesting the French fashion icon may have used the documents to restore her reputation after the war.
The previously unseen documents were revealed to the public in mid-September at the opening of a London exhibition tracing the life and legacy of the French couturier. Alongside more than 50 of Chanel’s iconic tweed suits and a whole room dedicated to Chanel No. 5 perfume, a part of the “Gabrielle Chanel: Fashion Manifesto” retrospective also deal…]]></summary>

The flight will leave London's Heathrow airport at 1130 GMT bound for New York's JFK.
It is the first time that SAF will be used "in both engines, by a commercial airline, for long-haul flight", the airline said in a statement.
However, the Boeing 787 plane equipped with Rolls-Royce engines will not carry any paying passengers or cargo.
SAFs are produced from renewable biomass and waste resources and can be used in jet fuel to a maximum of 50 percent, having been blended with kerosene, in modern aircraft.

The New Voice of Ukraine: Ukraine’s foreign intel head paints harrowing picture of Russia’s plans, list’s Top 4 priorities 
The Kremlin has an aggressive plan for the future and is currently solving four tasks, Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service head, Oleksandr Lytvynenko, said in his column for Interfax-Ukraine on Nov. 22. 
Task No. 1 is to ensure internal stability, mobilize the population and economy, and increase the production of weapons and military equipment. 
 "The Kremlin has so far ensured economic stability and control over socio-political processes," Lytvynenko wrote. 
“The political field has been cleared: the liberal and far-right (so-called "turbo-patriots") opposition has been destroyed or marginalized.” 
 By 2026, Russia's military production should support large-scale high-intensity hostilities, and in 2028, the aggressor should restore the military capabilities it had as of 2022, Lytvynenko says. 
"This is what the Russian budget for 2024-2026 is designed for," he wrote.

WNU Editor: I agree with his first two points on what is Russia's approach towards the war. But his attempt to instill fear among Russia's neighbors that they are next is not producing the result that he is hoping for. These countries are more focused on increasing their defenses, and will not intervene directly in the current war.]]></summary>

They used climate modeling powered by a network of interconnected processors to analyze possible extinction scenarios without human input or bias. By modeling […]

Strategic Culture: It Pays to Be Friends With Zelensky: How $75m Yachts Reveal the Huge and Sudden Wealth of the Ukrainian Leader’s Inner Circle 
In the heart of Eastern Europe, where the tumult of war clashes with the allure of Western support, a seismic scandal unfolds, casting a long shadow over Ukraine’s leadership. President Volodymyr Zelensky, once seen as a beacon of hope against corruption, is now ensnared in a scandal involving the alleged purchase of two luxury yachts, “Lucky Me” and “My Legacy,” worth a combined $75 million. This lavish expenditure, facilitated in the opulent settings of Abu Dhabi and Antibes, starkly contrasts with Ukraine’s dire war reality and raises damning questions about the integrity and criminal liability of its leadership amidst heavy reliance on Western aid.

Two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi rebel-controlled Yemen toward a US warship in the Gulf of Aden, after the US Navy responded to a distress call from a commercial tanker that had been seized by armed individuals, the US military said Sunday.
The tanker, identified as the Central Park, had been carrying a cargo of phosphoric acid when its crew called for help that “they were under attack from an unknown entity,” the US Central Command said in a statement. 
Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday that under international maritime norms and laws, when there is a distress signal, “all vessels in the vicinity, are required to come and help and support.” Though Ryder added that there were three Chinese Navy vessels in the vicinity that “did not respond.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[C. William Walldorf, Jr., Real Clear Wire: Time to Drawdown From Syria 
As part of the fallout from the war in Gaza, U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq have come under attack more than fifty times from Iranian-backed militias since early October.  At least fifty-six military personnel have been injured. In response, the U.S. launched retaliatory air strikes and has sent about 900 more troops to the region. 
This bolstering of forces is the wrong move. In fact, the U.S. is overdue to drawdown its forces from Syria. 
Why drawdown completely?  The answer is simple.  The small contingent of U.S. forces in Syria, especially, are sitting ducks for further attacks in support of missions where the costs of continuing those missions now far outstrip their strategic benefits.  Recent attacks bring this mismatch between costs and benefits into sharp relief.  These incidents should also serve as a warning for potential dangers if U.S. policy fails to change course.

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
