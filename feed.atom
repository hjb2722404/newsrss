RT:  Pentagon leaks reveal date of Ukrainian counteroffensive – Newsweek

 
Kiev is reportedly expected to launch a push against Russian forces at the end of this month  
The start of Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russian troops has been planned for April 30, Newsweek reported on Sunday, citing a leaked Pentagon document. 
Dated February 28, the file details equipment deliveries and a training schedule for nine brigades that “can be generated for the spring counteroffensive” with the help of the US and its allies. Three additional brigades are expected to be gathered “internally” in Ukraine, according to the file. 
Out of the nine brigades trained and equipped by Western countries, six will be ready by March 31, while the “final” three will be ready by April 30, the document claimed.

DW: Sweden starts largest military exercise in over 25 years 
More than 26,000 soldiers from 14 countries, including the US and European members of NATO, are taking part in Sweden's largest military drill in decades. 
Swedish authorities launched military exercise Aurora 23 on Monday, starting weeks of drills "in the air, on ground and at sea," according to a statement from the Swedish Armed Forces. 
Aurora 23 is the biggest exercise in Sweden in more than 25 years, and will run until May 11. 
 Soldiers from the US, the UK, France, Germany and neighboring Nordic nations are all taking part in the drills. The exercise aims to train the troops for the event of a major armed attack on Sweden.

Bloomberg: Taiwan to Buy 400 US Anti-Ship Missiles Intended to Repel a China Invasion 
(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan will buy as many as 400 land-launched Harpoon missiles intended to repel a potential Chinese invasion, completing a deal that Congress approved in 2020, according to a trade group’s leader and people familiar with the issue. 
Taiwan has previously purchased ship-launched versions of the Harpoon, which is made by Boeing Co. Now, a contract with Boeing issued on Taiwan’s behalf by the US Naval Air Systems Command marks a first for the mobile, land-launched version, according to Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council. Three other people familiar with the deal, including an industry official, confirmed the contract is for Taiwan. 
The Pentagon announced the $1.7 billion contract with Boeing on April 7 but made no mention of Taiwan as the purchaser. The deal comes as US-China tensions are high, particularly over Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims as part of its territory. China held military drills around Taiwan after its president met in California this month with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

EurAsian Times: Invisible Aircraft: How Russian Radars Busted The Myth Of Stealth Fighters & Proved It’s All Hype & No Substance 
The word ‘stealth’ in military parlance conjures up a vision of Hollywood star Kevin Bacon going invisible during a scientific test in the film Hollow Man released in 2020, or Hollywood actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen acquires the ability to go invisible in the 2022 film Invisible Man. 
The invisible man idea is fine for being stealthy as a fiction or entertainment story. But is ‘stealth’ valid in reality, with specific reference to an aircraft being invisible to the ground or the airborne radar? 
Major powers have already spent billions of US dollars, viz China, Russia, and the US, towards R&D in this field and producing operational aircraft. USA took the lead by manufacturing F-117, F-22, F-35, and B-2 and to-be inducted strategic bomber B-21. China and Russia have miles to go.

Reuters: ANALYSIS-China's intensifying nuclear-armed submarine patrols add complexity for U.S., allies 
HONG KONG, April 4 (Reuters) - China is for the first time keeping at least one nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine constantly at sea, according to a Pentagon report - adding pressure on the United States and its allies as they try to counter Beijing's growing military. 
The assessment of China's military said China's fleet of six Jin-class ballistic missile submarines were operating "near-continuous" patrols from Hainan Island into the South China Sea. Equipped with a new, longer-range ballistic missile, they can hit the continental United States, analysts say. 
The note in the 174-page report drew little attention when it was released in late November, but shows crucial improvements in Chinese capabilities, according to four regional military attaches familiar with naval operations and five other security analysts.

SCMP: China claims another success in midcourse ballistic missile interception test 
* Test carried out within country's territory is sixth success of its kind and 'accomplished its objectives', defence ministry says 
* China needs to carry out repeated tests to improve technology and be able to hit multi-warhead targets, expert observes 
China successfully tested a ground-based midcourse ballistic missile interception, the defence ministry announced on Friday. 
The result brought the number of such missile interceptions to at least six. 
Friday's test took place within Chinese territory and space and "accomplished its objectives", according to a statement from the ministry. 
"This test is defensive in nature and it does not target any particular country," the statement added, without elaborating.

DF-17 Dongfeng medium-range ballistic missiles equipped with a DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, involved in an October 2019 military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Republic. The DF-27 is a new and improved version of the DF-17

 
Daily Mail: Leaked Pentagon files show China successfully tested new hypersonic ICBM which can evade US defenses 
* Among the classified documents leaked by Jack Teixeira was a February 28 top-secret report by the Joint Chiefs of Staff intelligence directorate 
* The document said that on February 25, China had successfully tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile called the DF-27 
* The DF-27 'possesses a high probability of penetrating US' missile defenses, the secret report said 
Pentagon files allegedly leaked by Jack Teixeira include a deeply troubling report about China's hypersonic missile program, and the revelation that a new missile believed to be capable of evading U.S. defenses has been successfully tested. 
Teixeira, 21, was arrested on Thursday at his home in Massachusetts. 
He is believed to have shared hundreds of classified documents with friends on a Discord chat room between the fall and mid March.

Among them was a February 28 top-secret report from the Joint Chiefs of Staff intelligence directorate, The Washington Post reported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atlantic Council: Putin cancels Victory Day parades as Ukraine invasion continues to unravel 
With Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations less than one month away, the Kremlin has taken the highly unusual step of canceling a number of military parades in regional capitals. Scheduled parades to mark the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi Germany have been called off in Kursk and Belgorod oblasts, which both border Ukraine. Victory Day celebrations in Russian-occupied Crimea have also reportedly been scrapped. 
The cancellations are officially due to security concerns related to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, numerous commentators have speculated that Moscow is also increasingly short of tanks and is understandably eager to avoid highlighting the scale of the losses suffered by the Russian army in Ukraine. Whether the real reason is security issues or equipment shortages, the decision to cancel this year’s Victory Day parades represents a painful blow for Vladimir Putin that hints at the grim reality behind Moscow’s upbeat propaganda portrayals of his faltering Ukraine invasion. 
Read more ....

 
WNU Editor: There is a lot of speculation from Western media sources on why this year's Victory Day celebrations got cancelled in a number of regional capitals. Not enough tanks/equipment and security concerns are often cited. I think the reason why these parades were cancelled is more basic. Everyone's focus in Russia right now is on winning the war, and not on having a parade. 
Update: It is not only the Victory Day parades that are being cancelled .... May 1 parade in Moscow cancelled due to "terror attacks" threat (The New Voice of Ukraine).]]></summary>

Reuters: US warship sails through Taiwan Strait following China war games 
TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) -The U.S. warship USS Milius sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, in what the U.S. Navy described on Monday as a "routine" transit, just days after China ended its latest war games around the island. 
China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, officially ended its three days of exercises around Taiwan last Monday where it practiced precision strikes and blockading the island. 
It staged the drills to express anger at Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's meeting with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, viewing it as an interference in China's internal affairs and U.S. support for Taiwan's separate identity from China.

Pepe Escobar: All Roads Lead to Beijing

 
This is the tale of two pilgrims following the road that really matters in the young 21st century; one coming from NATOstan and another one from BRICS. 
Let’s start with Le Petit Roi, Emmanuel Macron. Picture him with a plastic grin in his face strolling alongside Xi Jinping in Guangzhou. Following the – long and gentle – sound of classic “High Mountain and Flowing Water”, they enter the Baiyun Hall  to listen to it played by the 1000-year-old Guqin (a beautiful instrument). They taste the fragrance of 1000-year-old tea – and muse on the rise and fall of great powers in the new millennium. 
And what does Xi tell Le Petit Roi? He explains that when you hear this eternal music played by this eternal instrument, you expect to be in the company of a bosom friend; you are in synch as much as the high mountain and the flowing water. That’s the deeper meaning of the ancient tale of musicians Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi, 25 centuries ago in the Kingdom of Chu: bosom friendship. Only bosom friends can understand the music.

Warren Buffett practically wrote the book on buy-and-hold investing, so when the Oracle of Omaha sells stock after just a few months, he must have good reason. 
The 92-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said he dumped the bulk of his $4.1 billion stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) within the space of one financial quarter last year in part owing to the risk of war in the island nation. 
Rising geopolitical tensions were “a consideration,” he said in an interview with Nikkei on Tuesday, arguing that he had better places to invest his firm’s capital even if the world's largest chipmaker by volume is a well-managed company.

The Hill: Biden: Military, intelligence community taking new steps to secure sensitive info 
President Biden on Friday said the military and intelligence community will take steps to secure sensitive information in the wake of the arrest of the suspected leaker of hundreds of Pentagon records. 
“While we are still determining the validity of those documents, I have directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information, and our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies,” Biden said in a statement.

ROK vessel collides with Chinese ship while responding to DPRK incursion south of the inter-Korean maritime border 
South Korea fired warning shots at a North Korean patrol boat late Saturday morning, according to a statement by South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) released the following day. 
A North Korean vessel crossed the maritime demarcation line in the Yellow Sea near South Korea’s westernmost island of Baengnyeong, the JCS said, adding that the ROK vessel fired warning shots at approximately 11:00 a.m. KST. 
During the incident, a South Korean navy vessel reportedly collided with a Chinese fishing vessel due to bad visibility, resulting in minor casualties aboard the ROK ship. 
In the statement, JCS said it continues to closely monitor “enemy movements.” It is unclear if the DPRK also responded to South Korea’s warning shots on Saturday.

Bloomberg: China Tensions High on Agenda as G-7 Diplomats Meet in Japan 
(Bloomberg) -- Tensions over China will be high on the agenda as top diplomats from Group of Seven nations meet over the next two days in Japan, according to a senior State Department official. 
Geopolitical challenges in Asia are set to come into greater focus now that Japan holds the rotating G-7 presidency, the official told reporters ahead of the foreign ministers’ meeting, which comes about a month before US President Joe Biden and other leaders will head to Hiroshima for the annual leaders summit. 
Tensions over Taiwan in particular are demanding attention after China again held military drills around the island following President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 
Around the same time, French President Emmanuel Macron said the European Union should avoid being dragged into a dispute with China by the US, highlighting divisions within the bloc.

Reuters: 'Zero capacity to save': Argentines buckle as inflation tops 104% 
BUENOS AIRES, April 14 (Reuters) - Argentina's annual inflation rate soared to 104.3% in March, the official statistics agency said on Friday, one of the highest rates in the world, straining people's wallets and stoking a cost-of-living crisis that has pushed up poverty. 
The inflation reading for the month came in at 7.7%, well above analyst forecasts of 7.1%, marking the fastest monthly rise since 2002 and piling pressure on the government which is contending with angry voters ahead of elections in October. 
 "I try to think that someday we're going to be better off. But the inflation we're living with today in Argentina is terrible. It feels like never before," said Claudia Hernansaez, a publishing company employee.

"In my case, I have zero capacity to save."

"You were prime minister from 2015 to 2018," said anchor Joy Reid. "Rupert Murdoch is — he runs a media empire. But what he does is very political. He was involved even in your ouster."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden, winding down an emotive visit to Ireland, broke down in tears Friday during a chance encounter with the priest who read the last rites to his late son.
The Irish-American president was on a visit to the celebrated Roman Catholic pilgrimage shrine at Knock, northwestern Ireland, on the final day of a three-day tour of his ancestral homeland.
Biden will later wrap up his trip with an outdoors address to thousands of well-wishers at St Muredach's Cathedral in Ballina.
In 1828, Biden's forebear Edward Blewitt sold the bricks that went into the construction of the Catholic cathedral, using the money to fund his family's later emigration to the United States.
At the Knock Shrine, organizers made the last-minute discovery of a link between the Biden family and one of their…]]></summary>

France's constitutional court approved the core parts of Macron's pension reform on Friday, paving the way for the centrist head of state to sign into law a hike in the retirement age to 64 from its current level of 62.
But the manner in which the legislation has been passed -- in the face of opposition from two out of three voters, trade unions, and a majority of MPs in the National Assembly -- has dismayed even previously sympathetic observers.
Pierre Rosanvallon, a highly respected sociologist and historian, issued a striking warning in early April that Macron needed to restore the legitimac…]]></summary>

(Reuters) - The United States has charged leaders of the Mexico-based Sinaloa Cartel with running a fentanyl trafficking operation fueled by Chinese chemical and pharmaceutical companies, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Three sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the onetime leader of the Sinaloa Cartel now imprisoned in the United States, were among those charged in what authorities called one of the most ambitious responses to date to a drug epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in the past eight years.
"We're going after the entire network, from precursors, to importation into Mexico, to the manufacturer, to the weapons, to the money launderers, to the distribution in the United States," Garland told reporters.

The quake struck at 4:55 pm local time (0955 GMT), the USGS said, with Indonesia's geological agency ruling out a tsunami after the epicenter was detected at a depth of 594 kilometers (370 miles).
Indonesia experiences frequent quakes due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
Friday's quake hit roughly 160 kilometers northwest of Surabaya, Indonesia's second-most populous city that is home to more than two million people.
The tremor was felt over a large part of Java and…]]></summary>

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea announced on Friday it had tested a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a development set to "radically promote" its forces, which experts said would facilitate missile launches with little warning.
Leader Kim Jong Un guided Thursday's test, and warned it would make enemies "experience a clearer security crisis, and constantly strike extreme uneasiness and horror into them by taking fatal and offensive counter-actions until they abandon their senseless thinking and reckless acts", North Korean state media said.
Analysts said it was the North's first use of solid propellants in an intermediate-range or intercontinental ballistic missile, a key task to deploying missiles faster during a war.

A green light from the heavily guarded institution would pave the way for the head of state to sign the changes into law and ensure they are implemented by year-end.
Experts believe the most likely scenario is that the nine-member body will censure some non-essential parts of the legislation but approve the core element of raising the retirement age to 64 from 62.
"The council will likely follow the course it always had -- not to counter big social or societal reforms," constitutional expert Laureline Fontaine told AFP.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea says it has tested a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its first known use of the propellant in a longer-range projectile, as it seeks the capability to launch with little preparation.
Here are some characteristics of solid-fuel technology, and how it can help the North improve its missile systems.
WHAT IS SOLID-FUEL TECHNOLOGY?
Solid propellants are a mixture of fuel and oxidiser. Metallic powders such as aluminium often serve as the fuel, and ammonium perchlorate, which is the salt of perchloric acid and ammonia, is the most common oxidiser.
The fuel and oxidiser are bound together by a hard rubbery material and packed into a metal casing.
When solid propellant burns, oxygen from the ammonium perchlorate combines with …]]></summary>

During the warmer months, members of the red-hatted "Tantpatrullen" (The Old Lady Patrol) gather every Thursday on the cobble streets of Stockholm's Old Town, right across from Sweden's parliament. They have just begun their 2023 protest season.
In a country that prides itself on being a champion of feminism and gender equality, the association of retired women is calling for an increase in pensions for women, who are penalised by a system that favours people with high salaries who work well into their sixties.

Quant "died peacefully at home in Surrey, UK, this morning", they said in a statement, calling her "one of the most internationally recognized fashion designers of the 20th century and an outstanding innovator".
Quant went down in the history books for the mini-skirt and making women's clothes fun and affordable.
Whether she actually invented the iconic fashion item has been the subject of a long and bitter dispute with late French designer Andre Courreges, among others.
But her role in turning the thigh-skimming super-short hemlines into an international trend has not been disputed.

But the country's plan to expand its hydrogen market and slash greenhouse emissions has suffered delays and criticism over the fuel's green credentials.
As G7 climate ministers meet this weekend in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, here are some key points about the strategy:

It added that vessels would be "forbidden to enter" for the duration of the shutdown.
The announcement came after Taiwan's transport ministry said Wednesday that Beijing planned to impose a no-fly zone north of the island due to "space activities".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired a missile on Thursday, South Korea and Japan said, prompting a warning for some Japanese residents to take cover.
The Japanese government warned residents of the northernmost main island of Hokkaido to take immediate cover, saying a missile was likely to fall near the island around 8 a.m. Japan time (2300 GMT).
The ballistic missile was launched off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
The launch comes two days after North Korean state media KCNA reported that leader Kim Jong Un called for strengthening the country's war deterrence in a "more practical and offensive" manner to counter what it called moves of aggression by the United States.
North Korea has criticized the recent series of joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea as escalating tensions, stepping up its weapons tests in recent months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Instant messaging platform Discord said on Wednesday it was cooperating with U.S. law enforcement's investigation into a leak of secret U.S. documents that has grabbed attention around the world.
The statement comes as questions continue to swirl over who leaked the documents, whether they are genuine and whether the intelligence assessments in them are reliable. The documents, which carry markings suggesting that they are highly classified, have led to a string of stories about the war in Ukraine, protests in Israel and how the U.S. surveils friend and foe alike.
The source of the documents is not publicly known, but reporting by the open-source investigative site Bellingcat has traced their earliest appearance to Discord, a communications platform popular with gamers.
Discord's statement suggested it was already in touch with investigators.
"In regards to the apparent breach of classified material, we are cooperating with law enforcement," the statement said. "As this remains an active investigation, we cannot provide further comment at this time."
The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
Although the documents only began drawing attention recently, Bellingcat said it found evidence that at least some of the files had been floating around on social media as far back as March or even January.
Bellingcat cited Discord users who it said gave similar accounts of the documents' provenance but cautioned that it was unable to independently verify all the information they shared.
Reuters could not immediately corroborate Bellingcat's reporting; attempts to reach former members of the server via the social media site Reddit and other servers on Discord were not immediately successful.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.

“We are totally back,” said Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
Retailers around Midtown office corridors “live and die with office density, and we’re seeing a noticeable difference,” said David LaPierre, vice president of CBRE.
Now, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of old and new concepts.
“It’s like the city and retailers have woken up,” said Jared Epstein, president and chief executive of Aurora Capital Associates.  “We had stock on just about everything from Soho to the Meatpacking District, West Village, Midtown and Brooklyn.
