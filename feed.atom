Across the Maghreb region, which takes in parts of the Sahara desert and is plagued by scorching summer heat, countries are banking on new desalination plants and facilities that can purify wastewater for farming.
In Tunisia, struggling through its fourth year of drought, engineers recently inspected a desalination plant being built in the southern town of Zarat on the Mediterranean coast.
Across the region, "the only solution is the desalination of seawater for human consumption", said Mosbeh Helali, outgoing CEO of Sonede, the company constructing the plant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 100 pilot whales have died after beaching in Western Australia, wildlife officials said Thursday, following desperate rescue attempts.
The pod of 97 long-finned pilot whales gathered in shallow water off Cheynes Beach, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Perth, on Tuesday, with scores stranding themselves on the sand.
By the next morning, 51 of the cetaceans had died.
Some 250 volunteers joined 100 wildlife experts in a vain struggle to save the rest of the pod throughout the day Wednesday.
Dozens of people in wetsuits stayed in the water, a few on kayaks or surfboards, trying to coax the tightly packed group of remaining pilot whales into deeper waters, and then out to sea.
"Volunteers and everyone attempted to get them back out into the deeper water, and then they re-beached themselves," a spokeswoman for the Parks and Wildlife Service told AFP.
"From that point, the vets assessed them and it was determined on welfare grounds that they needed to be euthanized."
Incident controller Peter Hartley thanked rescuers for their "enormous efforts" to save the whales in cold waters.
"Probably one of the hardest decisions in my 34 years in wildlife management -- really, really difficult," he told journalists Thursday.
But the decision to euthanize the pilot whales was "considered", Hartley said.
"We know that whale strandings are a natural phenomenon but we gave it a good go, spending the whole day in the water with those animals to give them the best opportunity," he added.
"Very hard to see. But this is nature, and it is a natural phenomenon that we do understand very little about."
Scientists do not fully understand why mass strandings occur, but pilot whales -- which can grow to more than six meters (20 feet) long -- are highly sociable, so they may follow pod-mates who stray into danger.]]></summary>

Moscow Times: Former U.S. Official Shares Details of Secret ‘Track 1.5’ Diplomacy With Moscow 
Secret diplomatic talks are ongoing between former senior U.S. national security officials and high-ranking members of the Kremlin, a former U.S. official directly involved in the talks has confirmed to The Moscow Times.

Known as track 1.5 diplomacy, these covert discussions enable both sides to understand each other's red lines and mitigate potential conflicts, serving as a crucial link between official government negotiations (track 1 diplomacy) and unofficial expert dialogues (track 2).

Niger’s President Mohamed Bazoum has reportedly been seized by members of the presidential guard, leading to a protest in the capital and triggering warnings from regional powers a coup is underway. 
The country’s interior minister, Hamadou Souley, was arrested by the presidential guard on Wednesday morning local time and is being held in the presidential palace in the capital Niamey along with Bazoum, a journalist on the ground, who spoke to the minister, confirmed to CNN. 
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said there had been an “attempt to seize power by force” in the West African country, in a statement on Wednesday.

Days after a House hearing on censorship that saw Democrats attempt to prevent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from testifying, a new Harvard-Harris poll showed that he has a higher favorability rating than any other presidential candidate. 
Mr. Kennedy has a net favorable rating of 47 percent and a net unfavorable mark of 26 percent according to the survey, which was released on July 23 and conducted from July 19 to July 20 among 2,068 registered voters (pdf). 
Poll respondents said that former President Donald Trump has a favorability rating of 45 percent compared to a 49 percent unfavorability number. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has a 40 percent favorable rating and 37 percent unfavorable, and President Joe Biden has 39 percent favorable and 53 percent unfavorable rating, also lagging behind Mr. Kennedy. 
Mr. Trump would win the Republican primary and defeat Mr. Biden in a general election, according to the survey, with a 45 percent to 40 percent margin.

Swiss Info: Zelensky showing ‘authoritarian traits’, says Swiss intelligence report 
Ukraine is at a “critical point” in its democratic evolution as it heads towards presidential elections in 2024, says a confidential assessment by the Federal Intelligence Service. 
The assessment, written in the wake of the attempted mutiny in Russia by the Wagner mercenary group and seen by the newspaper NZZ am Sonntag, claims that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is attempting to politically eliminate his biggest rival, Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko, ahead of next year’s election. The claim, it added, is based on “credible intelligence.” 
"In his attempt to eliminate Klitschko politically, Zelensky is showing authoritarian traits,” write the report’s authors. "It is very likely that Western states will exert pressure on the president and his entourage in this regard."

WNU Editor: President Zelensky has banned all major opposition parties and some of its leaders are in jail. There are also media restrictions that can result in journalists and bloggers going to jail (i.e. Gonzala Lira). If that is not an "authoritarian trait", then I do not know what is.

 
Update: Some Europeans are beginning to point this out (see tweet below).

New York Times: ‘They Shoot Without Stopping:’ Where Russia Is on the Attack in Ukraine 
Three Russian attack helicopters swooped in low over the city of Kreminna, strafing Ukrainian frontline positions just outside the city. Russian drones circled overhead while Moscow’s ground forces fired heavy machine guns to flush out Ukrainians from foxholes hidden in the dappled light of the pine forest.

WNU Editor: This report makes the New York Times the first major Western news outlet yo admit that there is a major Russian counteroffensive in northeast Ukraine. WNU has been reporting on this offensive for the past few days. 
And while the New York Times is saying that Russian advances are minor and being accomplished at great costs, I am reading reports frm sources that I trust that the Ukraine front-lines along this part of the front have collapsed, the Ukraine army is withdrawing, and that in some cases Russian forces have advanced over 10km along a major section of the front. 
This is the first major Russian offensive since the start of the war. It involves over 100,000 soldiers, heavily backed by armor and air superiority. 
Here is an easy prediction. I expect more Western coverage in the coming days.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero Hedge: In "Victory" For Moscow, Russia Defies Sanctions By Selling Oil Above Western Price Cap 
Two weeks ago we reported that with a barrel of Urals about to rise above $60, the "Russian oil price at key port was about to breach sanctions cap", which - if the sanctions were strenuously enforced - meant that there would be a sharp drop in supply. 
Fast forward to today when, as the WSJ reported, the price of Russia's most coveted crude finally traded above the western price cap imposed to starve Moscow of funds for the war in Ukraine (but not really, because starving the world of Russian oil has long been viewed as a far more dangerous outcome), resulting in a very distinct "victory" for Moscow in the "fight for influence over global oil markets." 
It is the first time that the price for its flagship Urals grade of oil has breached the $60-a-barrel limit since the U.S. and its allies introduced the novel sanctions policy last December, according to commodities-data firm Argus Media, and - as the WSJ clarifies - it is a sign that the Kremlin has succeeded, at least in part, in adjusting to the restrictions.

WNU Editor: There is an expectation that both China and India will be consuming an extra 2-3 million barrels of oil by the end of this year. That alone is going to raise the price of oil significantly, and it will provide more opportunities for Russia to sell its oil at a price significantly above the price cap of $60/barrel. 
And while Russian oil exports by sea continue to decrease .... Russian Crude Oil Exports Continue To Plunge (OilPrice.com), oil shipments by pipeline to customers like China are booming .... China hugely boosts crude stockpiling on cheap Russian oil: Russell (Reuters). 
 Update: The EU wants to keep on doubling down on stupid .... The EU Has No Plans To Revise Its Russian Oil Price Cap (OilPrice.com).]]></summary>

Below is my column in the New York Post on the last ditch effort of the members of Congress and the media to get the public to just “move on” from the Biden corruption scandal. 
The message has been clear and amplified, as former U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) insisted on MSNBC, “Everybody needs to back off!” As evidence and public interest increase, it is a bit late for spin or shiny objects. This week, the scandal is likely to be even more serious for the Bidens and the country. The media is increasingly taking on the appearance of Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun yelling that there is “nothing to see here” in front of a virtual apocalyptic scene of fire and destruction.

WNU Editor: Jonathan Turley is always a good read. Especially when it comes to commentary on US law.

My sister-in-law lives in the Bay area, and she and her neighbors are die-hard supporters of President Biden and the Democrat Party. And she and her neighbors put their money where their mouth is. The money that she has given, with my brother's support, to Democrats over the years has been eye-watering. 
But when I was talking to her last week, she wanted affirmation from me that Biden's scandals are just the Republicans being political, and there is really no substance to them. 
LOL! 
When your die-hard supporters need to call others to be convinced that the person they are supporting is not the person that the critics are saying .... sighhh .... for a politician that is the kiss of death. 
As for my sister-in-law. I told her that what we are seeing and what we know is just the tip of the iceberg.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach on Wednesday formally invited 203 countries, but not Russia and Belarus, to participate in the Paris Olympics which begin in a year's time.
Bach had said in mid-July that neither Russia nor its ally in the invasion of Ukraine, Belarus, would be invited as a team.
The IOC has however left the door open for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals in the 2024 Summer Games without their teams competing.
Bach is on a three-day visit to the French capital to mark the one-year-to-go milestone on Wednesday.
"In accordance with the Olympic Charter it is my great honor and pleasure to mark this important milestone today by inviting the athletes of the world to come together in Paris, France, to celebrate the Games of the 33rd Olympiad," Bach said.
Bach said he had "just received excellent information about the preparations for Paris 2024" after touring the construction site of the Athletes' Village on Tuesday.
He said then that the competitors would be "very happy" in the Village.
Guatemala were not invited either because it is currently suspended from the Olympic movement due to alleged government interference with the independence of the National Olympic Committee there.]]></summary>

The United States on Tuesday announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine featuring ammunition for artillery and air defense systems.

The package includes munitions for both Patriot and NASAMs air defense systems as well as Stinger missiles, 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, 32 Stryker armored personnel carriers, and more than 28 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenades, the Pentagon said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Defense announced $400 million in additional security assistance for Ukraine on Tuesday, including air defense missiles, armored vehicles and small drones, as Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia grinds on. 
The new aid package, which was first reported by Reuters, will include for the first time U.S. furnished Black Hornet surveillance drones made by Teledyne FLIR Defense, part of Teledyne Technologies. 
The Norwegian-built Hornet is being used in Ukraine through donations by the British and Norwegian governments, the company said. FLIR Unmanned Aerial Systems was awarded a $93 million contract in April to provide the small reconnaissance drones to the U.S. Army.

FOX News: Family forced to pay to ship body of Marine killed after Pentagon policy change: 'Egregious injustice'

 
Nonprofit stepped in to pay $60,000 to move Sgt Nicole Gee's remains to Arlington National Cemetery 
A Republican lawmaker is sounding the alarm after being notified that one of the 13 Gold Star families from the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was forced to pay to move the body of their loved one. 
Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., who is an Army veteran, told Fox News Digital that during a meeting with the families of the "Fallen 13" last week, he was "enraged to learn that the Department of Defense had placed a heavy financial burden" on the family of Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, who were forced to find funding in the thousands to move her body to its final resting place after her 2021 death in Afghanistan. 
The Gee family secured the funding, which came to "a staggering $60,000," to move their loved one's body after a nonprofit organization stepped in to cover the cost, Mills said.

Messenger: Freed in Russia Prisoner Swap, US Marine Injured Fighting in Ukraine (Exclusive)

 
US officials are frustrated that Trevor Reed went to Ukraine after the efforts made to bring him home from Russia 
A Marine veteran who was freed from Russia in a 2022 prisoner exchange has volunteered to fight for Ukraine and is now asking for U.S. government help after sustaining injuries on the battlefield, The Messenger has learned. 
Trevor Reed was wounded after stepping on a landmine roughly two weeks ago, according to two U.S. military officials who were briefed on the events. Reed had spent more than two years in Russian custody before winning his freedom in April 2022. 
The officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to Defense Department regulations, said they did not know the extent of Reed’s injuries but said he had suffered shrapnel wounds from the explosion. One of the sources said Reed was being treated in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and had requested transfer to an American military facility in either Germany or Poland.

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks.
