        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daily Mail: Trump says he's being 'persecuted' for leading polls after pleading not guilty to January 6 charges: 'If you can't beat him, prosecute him' 
* The former president entered a not guilty plea in a federal D.C. courtroom on Thursday afternoon 
* He vented about Biden family 'bribes' as he flew in from Newark, New Jersey 
* Faces four federal charges on alleged plot to overturn the 2020 election 
Donald Trump said he's being 'persecuted' because he's leading in the polls and ripped into the 'filth' in Washington, D.C., after pleading not guilty in a federal court to four criminal charges for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. 
 'When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent,' Trump said to reporters without taking questions after arriving at Reagan National Airport following his third arraignment in six months. 
'This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So if you can't beat him, you persecute them or you prosecute him. We can’t let this happen in America.'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canada's The Mining Company will seek a license next year to start mining the depths of the Pacific Ocean, with production expected to follow in 2025, according to a statement.
It posted on its website late Tuesday that its subsidiary Nauru Ocean Resources intends to submit an application to the International Seabed Authority (ISA).
"Assuming a one-year review process, NORI expects to be in production in the fourth quarter of 2025," it added.
The International Seabed Authority (ISA)'s member nations agreed in July on a two-year roadmap for the adoption of deep sea mining regulations, despite conservationists' calls for a moratorium on mineral extraction they say would avert marine threats.
The little-known global body is tasked with regulating the vast ocean floor.
Some countries want to hurry up and begin retrieving rock-like "nodules" scattered across the seafloor, which contain minerals important to battery production such as nickel, cobalt and copper.
But NGOs and scientists say that trawling the deep seas could destroy habitats and species that may still be unknown or potentially vital to ecosystems.

The Mining Company and others are eyeing an abyssal plain stretching between Hawaii and Mexico, known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), for the nodules.
Its chief executive Gerard Barron said the timeline it has laid out "gives us more time to strengthen our environmental dataset" while providing more time also for ISA work on mining code regulations and procedures.
It estimated it must also raise $60 million to $70 million to proceed with its application for a license, in addition to $20 million in cash it has on hand.
The company said it lifted 3,000 tonnes of nodules from the seafloor in trials last year, and aims to mine an estimated three million wet tonnes per year.

The alleged focus of the meetings was to assist the administration while it struggled to combat COVID vaccine hesitancy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activists from Greenpeace were arrested Thursday after scaling UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency home in northern England and covering it with black fabric to protest his fossil fuel policy.
Sunak this week approved hundreds of new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea off Britain's east coast, angering environmentalists.
"We desperately need our prime minister to be a climate leader, not a climate arsonist," said Greenpeace UK climate campaigner Philip Evans.
"Just as wildfires and floods wreck homes and lives around the world, Sunak is committing to a massive expansion of oil and gas drilling."
Greenpeace UK posted videos of four activists climbing onto the roof of Sunak's mansion in Richmond, north Yorkshire, and covering it with black sheets.
It later said that the activists, who spent around five hours on Sunak's roof, had been arrested.
Two more activists unfurled a banner reading "Rishi Sunak -- Oil Profits or Our Future?" on the front lawn.
The prime minister and his family are currently on holiday in California.
"He seems quite happy to hold a blowtorch to the planet if he can score a few political points by sowing division around climate in this country," said Evans.
"This is cynical beyond belief."
Separately, dozens of mothers joined forces outside parliament to demonstrate against the government's policy.
"We all know that climate science screams that we cannot have more fossil fuels... I am really furious on behalf of my kids," said protest organizer Lorna Powell, 37.
"Instead of being a climate leader and acting in the right way, he's decided that he is going to use it as a political game to try and stoke a culture war," she added.
Downing Street insists the policy is essential to ensure Britain's domestic energy security, and that it can still meet its 2050 net zero goals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mexican government said Wednesday that a dead body had been found caught in the controversial floating barriers installed by Texas authorities to stop migrants crossing into the United States.
US authorities informed Mexico that "they found the body of a lifeless person stuck in the southern part of the buoys" on the Rio Grande river, the Mexican foreign ministry said in a statement.
The cause of death and nationality of the victim were unknown, it added.
The ministry expressed "concern about the impact on the human rights and personal safety of migrants that these state policies will have."
The buoys were installed in the river at a popular migrant crossing point in July on the instructions of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, along with large razor-wire barriers on shore. 
In response, the US Justice Department has filed a lawsuit in a federal court, saying the buoys illegally obstruct river navigation and lack federal authorization.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that the barriers violate his country's sovereignty.
Hundreds of migrants die each year along the US-Mexico border, mostly while trying to cross the Rio Grande.

The devastating wildfires have burned some 30 million acres (12 million hectares) this year so far, incinerating an area larger than the size of Cuba or South Korea.
Enormous plumes of smoke have choked the air in Canada and neighboring United States, affecting more than 100 million people and at times disrupting flights and forcing the cancellation of outdoor events.

The renewed political instability has revived long-held fears in a country that has seen more than a dozen military coups in the past century.
So what is happening, why, and what might come next?
- How did we get here? -
Thailand held elections in May, returning a shock win for the progressive Move Forward Party (MFP), buoyed by many Thais' desire for change and an end to almost a decade of army-backed rule.
But their plans, which included amending strict royal defamation laws, spooked the powerful conservative establishment.
An eight-party coalition headed by MFP failed to sec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pope Francis on Wednesday met with victims of clerical sexual abuse, as he began a five-day visit to Portugal for a major Catholic youth festival.
The 86-year-old pontiff had earlier said that the "anguished cry" of sexual abuse victims must be heard, six months after a report into the abuse that shook Portugal.
Francis was welcomed with military honors in Lisbon, where one million pilgrims from around the world are expected to take part in World Youth Day festivities.
The event – a week of religious, cultural and festive events held about every three years in a different city – comes as the Church reflects on its future and grapples with priest pedophilia scandals.
A report released in February in Portugal by an independent commission concluded that at least 4,815 children had been abused by clergy members, mostly priests, in the country since 1950.
The inquiry – similar to audits elsewhere in Europe and the Americas – concluded that the Church hierarchy "systematically" tried to conceal the abuse.
In an address to the clergy at Lisbon's vast Jeronimos Monastery, the pontiff said the sex abuse scandals had "marred" the Church and sparked "disappointment and anger".
These scandals "call us to a humble and ongoing purification, starting with the anguished cry of the victims, who must always be accepted and listened to," he added.
'Intense listening'
"The meeting was held in an atmosphere of intense listening and lasted more than an hour," it added.

The Biden administration is again delaying a replenishment of the nation’s emergency oil reserve because of market conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. The decision comes as oil prices have rallied above $80 a barrel. 
The Department of Energy is not taking up offers it got for a potential purchase, said the people, who asked not to be identified as details of the process haven’t been published. The administration rejected offers in January.

Anadolu Agency: US warns Wagner attack on NATO will be treated as Russian attack

 
Wagner Group, at behest of Russian government, is a threat to us all, says Linda Thomas-Greenfield 
The US ambassador to the United Nations warned Monday that any attack on NATO by Russia’s Wagner Group will be treated as an attack by Russia. 
Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the remarks while briefing reporters in New York on various issues including ending famine, combating food insecurity in conflicts and defending human rights. 
Asked about the presence of Wagner Group mercenaries on the Polish border and whether she sees them as a real threat to NATO, she said: "We certainly worry that this group, at the behest of the Russian government – because they do not work independently of the Russian government – is a threat to all of us." 
She emphasized that the message should be clear that "any attack by the Wagner Group will be seen as an attack by the Russian government.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gallup: Biden Averages 40.7% Job Approval in 10th Quarter 
 * Biden’s 10th-quarter average approval was one point higher than ninth quarter 
* Only Carter’s 10th-quarter average was lower than Biden’s 
* Favorable rating of Biden is 41%; Kamala Harris, 38% 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Joe Biden’s job approval rating during his 10th quarter in office averaged 40.7%, marking a one-percentage-point uptick from last quarter, which was the lowest of his presidency.

 
Read more .... 
WNU Editor: These low job approval numbers are happening at the same time when all the media focus is on former President Trump. A US economy that has low unemployment numbers, and the appearance that inflation is going down. 
So why the low numbers? 
 I think there is a lot more at play right now. I think most Americans now realize that President Biden has serious cognitive issues that will get worse with time. And then there is the economy. Americans may be working but the cost of living is making a lot of people nervous, and coupled with high interest rates and high debt levels, creating an anxiety level that I have not seen for a long time. And then there are the corruption stories like this one .... Joe Biden Met With Moscow Mayor's Wife Before $3.5 Million Wire To Hunter: Devon Archer (Zero Hedge) and this one .... Devon Archer Spills The Beans: Tells Congress About Shady Burisma Dealings, Joe Biden's "More Than 20" Conversations (Zero Hedge).]]></summary>

A skyscraper in Russia's capital Moscow has been attacked by a drone for the second time in two days, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said. 
Several drones were shot down overnight on Monday, he said, but "one flew into the same tower at the Moskva City complex" that was targeted on Sunday. 
Russia's defence ministry blamed Ukraine for the latest attack.

Kyiv did not comment on responsibility but warned Russia that the conflict could soon move to its territory. 
It did not address separate Russian claims that three Ukrainian sea drones were destroyed while trying to attack Russian naval ships in the Black Sea, though did dismiss as "fictitious" further claims that Russian civilian ships had also been targeted.

Millions of people have been hit by extreme weather events and prolonged heatwaves around the globe in recent weeks, events that scientists say are being exacerbated by climate change.
And the Beijing Meteorological Service said the capital has just experienced the "heaviest rainfall in 140 years", when city authorities started keeping records.
"The maximum (amount) of rainfall recorded during this storm, which was 744.8 millimeters, occurred at the Wangjiayuan Reservoir in Changping," the service said, adding the largest volume previously recorded was 609 millimeters in 1891.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One person was reportedly killed and hundreds of thousands were without electricity in southern Japan on Wednesday as a typhoon approached packing powerful winds and lashing rain.
Hundreds of flights to Okinawa and other islands in the area were cancelled, stranding thousands of tourists holidaying in the region's tropical beach resorts.
Typhoon Khanun, described as "very strong" by the Japanese weather agency, brought maximum sustained wind speeds of 180 kilometers (112 miles) an hour.
Okinawa's power company said 220,580 households -- nearly 35 percent of the total in the region -- had no electricity early on Wednesday.
An evacuation warning issued across Okinawa and the southern part of Kagoshima region was in place, urging more than 690,000 residents to move to safety, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
The agency said a total of 11 people in Okinawa were mildly injured.
A 90-year-old man died after being trapped under a collapsed garage on Tuesday evening, public broadcaster NHK reported, adding that strong winds were probably the cause.
The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of flooding and landslides in some parts of the main island of Okinawa.
The typhoon was about 70 kilometers south of Okinawa's remote Kumejima island at 2300 GMT and was moving west-northwest, according to the JMA.
It was expected to cross to eastern China later in the week.
More than 400 flights were cancelled on Wednesday, according to NHK, affecting more than 65,000 passengers.
On Tuesday, tourists made long queues at the main Naha airport, hoping to get back home.
"We haven't been able to secure a hotel and we don't know when the return flight can be booked," Minako Kawakami told local daily Okinawa Times.]]></summary>

"I research the fetish," says the 28-year-old, a figure wearing a dramatic red wig ahead of her fight and holding a cane that she says is imbued with mystical powers.
Maitresse Libondans is a practitioner of "catch-fetiche," also called voodoo wrestling -- a wildly over-the-top Congolese sport where fighters grapple with each other and use magic to try to gain supremacy.
She will only step into the ring if her ancestors, reached through spiritual rites, assure her of conquest.
And once in combat, she uses her signature fighting technique: baring her chest to hypnotize her opponent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Politico.eu:  Niger coup sparks concerns about French, EU uranium dependency 
Niger is the provider of 15 percent of France’s uranium needs and accounts for a fifth of the EU’s uranium stock. 
The military coup in Niger is raising fears, especially in France, over its potential impact on the import of uranium to power nuclear plants.

Niger supplies 15 percent of France’s uranium needs and accounts for a fifth of the EU’s total uranium imports. Orano, France's state-controlled nuclear fuel producer, is continuing its activities in Niger and monitoring the situation, a company spokesperson said in a statement emailed to POLITICO, stressing that "our priority is to maintain the safety of our employees in the country." 
The French government and energy experts were quick to stress that the tensions will not have any immediate impact on France's needs for uranium as extraction is continuing and, should it stop, existing stocks could still cover approximately two years.

Update: Niger coup raises questions about uranium dependence (AFP).

 
WNU Editor: The official line is there is nothing to worry about and they are probably right .... EU sees 'no immediate risks' if Niger cuts uranium supplies (Reuters). But Niger is one of the world's largest producers of uranium, and if this export ban continues prices are going to increase even more than the current spike in prices .... Uranium price ticks up after Niger coup, more gains expected (Reuters).]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
