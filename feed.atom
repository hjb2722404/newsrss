        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus says the weapons found inside Al-Shifa Hospital prove Hamas uses hospitals for non-hospital purposes.

“We are going to prove by exposing the underground tunnels that we have started tapping into and by exploring the perimeter of the area and really getting into the deep underground of the hospital,” he told Sky News Australia.

“Then we will be able to prove that Hamas really uses this hospital as a command-and-control position.”

Lt Conricus forecasts the IDF will soon prove more as he claimed Hamas used the Al-Shifa Hospital on October 7 when they carried out terror attacks.

“We know the area is rife with Hamas operatives carrying weapons and patrolling the hospital.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 32 babies inside Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza were safely evacuated to southern Gaza as the medical centre was captured without a single Palestinian being wounded, says IDF Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus.

“They were evacuated through incubators which we, the IDF, provided – I know so because I was on the ground,” he told Sky News Australia. 

Lt Conricus also denied reports babies died from lack of oxygen due to electricity supplies being turned off. 

“There was a convoy of Red Crescent ambulances that made its way through a humanitarian corridor that we facilitated from Shifa in northern Gaza towards southern Gaza.

“And the report that I have, which was confirmed also with the Egyptians, is they have arrived safely at the hospital in southern Gaza – all the babies that left the Shifa Hospital.”]]></summary>

China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning has defended its ship which essentially emitted a sonar ping that injured an Australian navy diver last week.

Ms Ning has also accused the Albanese government of causing trouble over the incident following the Prime Minister's comments to Sky News Australia on Monday.

During the interview, Mr Albanese condemned the ship for acting dangerously or unprofessionally.

The Chinese newspaper the Global Times has also tried to muddy the waters by suggesting the HMAS Toowoomba had been sailing through disputed waters.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-20T17:45:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who infamously peddled conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that were concocted by a woman who believes she can talk with the wind, is now floating wild conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19.
While there is still some debate over whether COVID-19 may have originated from a viral research lab in the city of Wuhan, Bartiromo on Monday took things several steps farther — and suggested that the virus was part of a deliberate plot to bring down former President Donald Trump.
During an interview with Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Bartiromo openly asked, "Is there a chance that China released this virus on America intentionally?"
In fact, there is no evidence of a Chinese plot to deliberately release a virus that spread all across the globe, not just in the United States, and that wound up killing millions of people, including an unquantified number of Chinese citizens.
ALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.
Regardless, Bartiromo went on to say that the goal of the Chinese government may have been to "disrupt" America to "get Donald Trump out, get your man in there, Joe Biden."
Wenstrup didn't explicitly endorse Bartiromo's theory, although he did leave open the possibility that the virus was released "accidentally."

The country has accused Russia of letting migrants from the Middle East and Africa without valid travel documents through to the Finnish border. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo stated that if the situation does not change, more measures will be taken, including the possibility of closing more border crossings. Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized Finland's decision, stating that it violates the rights and interests of citizens from both countries.]]></summary>

The 30-year-old "jumped out of bed, and after a minute or two already he was wearing his uniform", Ohana said.
"I made him a coffee to take with him, and we kissed," Ohana said. "I told him not to be a hero."

Sputnik: US Troops Dispatched to Secure Israel's Top Secret Nuclear Facilities: Report 
 US officials have vacillated between denying the presence of American boots on the ground in Israel, and admitting that small numbers of commandos have been deployed to help search for hostages and advise their Israeli counterparts. 
US troops have reportedly been dispatched to help secure Israel’s highly sensitive nuclear facilities, including the top secret site at Dimona – the alleged birthplace of the Israeli’s suspected nuclear arsenal. 
Sources speaking to an independent online Arabic-language newspaper indicated that the US told a Lebanese intelligence intermediary that American troops “would not participate” in field operations in the Gaza Strip “under any circumstances,” but rather be deployed to “secure and protect” two Israeli research reactors, the Negev Nuclear Research Center near the city of Dimona, and a second facility in the desert near the locality of Yavne in central Israel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least 21 people, including three children, died after heavy rainfall inundated the Dominican Republic over the weekend, authorities said Sunday, warning the downpours were linked to worsening climate change.
Torrential storms over the past 48 hours have caused flooding, damaged infrastructure and brought down houses in the Caribbean nation, in what President Luis Abinader has called the "largest rainfall event ever" in the country's history.
"Those who do not believe in climate change, start believing," said Abinader, who spoke of "extensive and substantial" damages, though without detailing precise figures.
The rains, from a tropical depression, are expected to continue across portions of the country for the next 24 hours, the US embassy said in a weather alert.
In one particularly deadly incident, a wall collapsed Sunday onto several vehicles traveling on a major avenue in the capital, Santo Domingo, killing nine.
The water "infiltrated a saturated subsoil," and the foundation of the concrete wall gave way, the Ministry of Public Works said Sunday.
An investigation into the incident has been ordered by the ministry.
Nine other people died in separate instances in Santo Domingo on the same day. Others have died after being swept away by flood waters.
Some 13,000 people have been evacuated across the country, according to the Emergency Operations Center, and a majority of the nation's 32 provinces are under an alert designation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indian rescuers were battling Monday to free 41 men trapped in a road tunnel for nine days, as they prepared to dig an entirely new shaft after previous efforts failed.
Excavators have been removing earth, concrete and rubble from the under-construction tunnel in the northern Himalayan state of Uttarakhand since November 12, after a portion of the tunnel collapsed.
But rescue efforts have been slowed by falling debris as well as repeated breakdowns of the crucial heavy drilling machines, with the air force having to twice airlift new kit.
Engineers had been trying to horizontally drive a steel pipe through the debris, just wide enough for the increasingly desperate men to squeeze through.
But drilling on that route was paused on Friday, after a cracking sound created a "panic situation", o…]]></summary>

Prosecutors have asked for guilty verdicts against 322 accused mafia members and their white-collar collaborators, in what could mark the most significant blow to date against one of the world's most powerful organised crime syndicates.
The 'Ndrangheta has moved beyond its roots in the poor southern Italian region of Calabria to exercise near-monopoly on the European cocaine trade, with a presence in more than 40 countries worldwide.
The sentencing will cap Italy's largest mafia trial in decades, a "maxi-trial" in which vast numbers of defendants accused of being part of the same mafia criminal conspiracy fac…]]></summary>

"Being president of Argentina has got to be one of the worst jobs in politics in the world," said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Argentina Project at the Washington-based Wilson Center.
"The problems have become so deep and complex and intertwined that they're not easily solvable, even if they're easily identifiable."
Milei surged to power on a wave of anger over decades of economic mismanagement, vowing to ditch the peso for the US dollar, shut down the central bank and slash spending.
He has promised "the end of Argentina's decline" and warned there is no time for "gradualism... or half-measures."…]]></summary>

President Joe Biden’s approval rating has declined to the lowest level of his presidency — 40% — as strong majorities of all voters disapprove of his handling of foreign policy and the Israel-Hamas war, according to the latest national NBC News poll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Red Cross said Monday that its president had travelled to Qatar to meet with Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh "to advance humanitarian issues related to the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza". Gaza's Hamas government said Monday the death toll in the Palestinian territory had passed 13,300 since war began on October 7. The figure could not be independently verified. And heavy fighting broke out earlier Monday around the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, where thousands of patients and displaced people have been sheltering for weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The man some called the Argentine Donald Trump has won Argentina's top post. 
Sunday evening, Javier Milei was declared the winner of the presidency in the country that has experienced significant inflation after the global pandemic. Despite this, Milei promised to kill government services, including healthcare, transportation and eliminate subsidies for utility bills, like gas, electricity and water. He intends to ban abortion and will refuse to take any action around climate change. 
In the past, the country has given funds to poor provinces in the country. Milei intends to cut those as well. 
The austerity measures are so significant that one NPR report suggested that the markets could crash in the country as a result of the election. After winning the primary, the country saw a slide, but not a crash. 
Donald Trump championed the win, posting on social media: "Congratulations to Javier Milei on a great race for President of Argentina. The whole world was watching! I am very proud of you. You will turn your Country around and truly Make Argentina Great Again!"
He followed it with a screen capture of a tweet showing the far-right libertarian standing behind a U.S. Gadsden flag.]]></summary>

RT:  Ukrainian military pilot defects to Russia – media 
The pilot is already on Russian territory and is being interviewed by the security services, the TASS news agency says  
A military pilot from the Armed Forces of Ukraine has defected to Russia, TASS reported on Saturday, citing a person who allegedly organized the pilot’s flight over the frontlines. The Ukrainian in question is an active-duty serviceman who held the rank of “senior officer” with Kiev’s forces, a Russian Telegram channel following the situation has claimed. 
“The Ukrainian armed forces pilot is currently in Russia and is being interviewed by the Federal Security Service,” a Russian military strike helicopter pilot identified by TASS as Aleksey Voevoda told the agency. Russians were reportedly behind the operation.

WASHINGTON — For the sixth year in a row, the Pentagon failed its annual audit. 
The result is not a surprise. The Department of Defense’s assets are vast and decentralized, amounting to $3.8 trillion alongside $4 trillion in liabilities. These are located in all 50 states and more than 4,500 sites around the world. 
 Since the Pentagon began auditing itself in 2018 — the last department to do so after Congress required the practice across the government in 1990 — it’s solved some of its easiest accounting problems. Now change each year is more incremental. 
If there’s change at all, that is — last year, auditors only rated seven of the nearly 30 sub-audits as clean. This year too there were seven.

MADRID (Reuters) -About 170,000 people marched through Madrid on Saturday in the largest protest yet against an amnesty law which Spain's Socialists agreed over Catalonia's 2017 separatist bid in order to form a government. 
The demonstration, the latest in a series of protests in cities across the country against the amnesty, took place two days after Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez won a four-year term with the backing of Catalan and Basque nationalist parties in return for agreeing to the law. 
Protesters, many waving Spanish flags and holding signs that read "Sanchez traitor" and "Don't sell Spain", demonstrated against the law which four judicial associations, opposition political parties and business leaders said threatens the rule of law and the separation of powers. 
Authorities put the number of demonstrators at 170,000.

Washington Post: Israel and Hamas reach tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause conflict, free dozens of hostages 
Israel, the United States and Hamas have agreed to a tentative deal that would free dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza, in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting. 
The release, which could begin within the next several days — barring last-minute hitches — could lead to the first sustained pause in conflict in Gaza, according to people familiar with its provisions. 
Under the terms of a detailed, six-page agreement, all parties to the conflict would freeze combat operations for at least five days while an initial 50 or more hostages are released in smaller batches every 24 hours. It was not immediately clear how many of the 239 people believed to be in captivity in Gaza would be released under the deal. Overhead surveillance would monitor movement on the ground to police the pause.

The incident came just as relations were beginning to strengthen between the two nations.

Reportedly, Australian Naval divers received minor injuries after contact with sonar from a Chinese Naval ship, despite Australian communication to China’s vessel that the divers were nearby.

Defence Minister Richard Marles confirmed the incident and says the Australian government has “expressed its serious concerns” over the “unsafe and unprofessional interaction”.

“Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a professional and safe manner.”]]></summary>

Turkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.
 Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. 
The rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…]]></summary>

How we turned 20,000 Soviet nukes into zero-carbon energy — and how we can do the same with some of our own.
 Just a decade ago, one in 10 American lightbulbs was powered by dismantled Russian nuclear weapons.
That was made possible by the Megatons to Megawatts program, an agreement negotiated after the collapse of the Soviet Union to convert uranium from Russia’s nuclear weapons stockpile into fuel for US nuclear power plants. The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…]]></summary>

What Turkey and Syria’s deadly earthquakes reveal about wealth.
 In the early hours of Monday, February 6, residents living in southern Turkey and northern Syria were woken by violent shaking, collapsing buildings, and sweeping blackouts. The earthquake buried residents in rubble and was followed by powerful aftershocks. By the following Monday, the death toll had passed 36,000 people. “It was like the apocalypse,” Abdul Salam al-Mahmoud, a resident of Atareb, Syria, told Reuters.  
The country is no stranger to quakes, having lost 17,000 people to a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1999. But while last week’s earthquake was a 7.8-magnitude quake, and had an u…]]></summary>

As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising.
 Now that the US military has shot down a suspected spy balloon from China and three other unidentified flying objects, there will be debates about the UFOs’ meaning, their capabilities, and why they were all up there in the first place. 
Though former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the initial balloon’s threat to the welfare of Americans was vastly inflated, others described the incident as a wake-up call. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster hopes it will lead to a “Sputnik moment,” harkening back to the US space race with the Soviet Union.
