          "description": "Buildings destroyed after the earthquake on February 13, 2023, in Hatay, Turkey. | Murat Saka/dia images via Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nTurkey is investigating and has arrested some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is implicated.\n Turkey is still in the middle of an emergency, reeling from the earthquake that killed at least 35,000 people last week. But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Like the rest of the country, many of its residents are suffering greatly from the nation's cost-of-living crisis but none more so than women and children. This as the number of food banks in the country now outnumber McDonald's outlets, with a fast-growing number of working women becoming regular customers seeking donated food. In a special edition, Annette Young meets a cross-section of women whose lives have been dramatically impacted by a rapidly declining economy.",

          "description": "In a further attempt to rein in increasing numbers of women defying the compulsory dress code, Iranian authorities are installing cameras in public places and thoroughfares to identify and penalize unveiled women, the police announced on Saturday.\nAfter they have been identified, violators will receive “warning text messages as to the consequences”, police said in a statement.\nThe move is aimed at “preventing resistance against the hijab law,” said the statement, carried by the judiciary’s Mizan news agency and other state media, adding that such resistance tarnishes the country’s spiritual image and spreads insecurity.\nA growing number of Iranian women have been ditching their veils since the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in the custody of the morality police last September. Mahsa Amini had been detained for allegedly violating the hijab rule. Security forces violently put down the revolt.\nStill, risking arrest for defying the obligatory dress code, women are still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country. Videos of unveiled women resisting the morality police have flooded social media.\nSaturday's police statement called on owners of businesses to “seriously monitor the observance of societal norms with their diligent inspections”.\nUnder Iran's Islamic sharia law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes to disguise their figures. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest.\nDescribing the veil as \"one of the civilizational foundations of the Iranian nation\" and “one of the practical principles of the Islamic Republic,” an Interior Ministry statement said on March 30 that there would be no retreat on the issue.\nIt urged citizens to confront unveiled women. Such directives have in past decades emboldened hardliners to attack women. Last week a viral video showed a man throwing yoghurt at two unveiled women in a shop.\n(Reuters)",

          "description": "SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - U.S. agents arrested a retired Salvadoran military officer this week on charges of participating in a brutal massacre of civilians during El Salvador's grinding civil war in the 1980s, according to a statement on Thursday.\nAgents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Roberto Garay on Tuesday in the state of New Jersey, the agency said.\nGaray served as section commander of a special military unit known as the Atlacatl Battalion from 1981 to 1985.\nRetired Salvadoran general Juan Rafael Bustillo acknowledged in 2020 that Atlacatl was responsible for the notorious 1981 El Mozote massacre, in which more than 1,000 villagers, mostly women and children, were slaughtered.\nThe battalion carried out extrajudicial executions at El Mozote, as well as in three other massacres in which \"hundreds of noncombatant civilians\" were killed, ICE said.\nGaray then \"willfully\" misrepresented his involvement in the massacre from an immigration application he had submitted, according to the statement.\nReuters was not immediately able to locate Garay's lawyer.\nOne of several bloody Central American conflicts linked to the Cold War, El Salvador's 1980-1992 civil war pitted the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels against the army of the U.S.-backed right-wing government.\nThe war left some 75,000 dead and another 8,000 missing.\nTouting the agency's investigation team that aims to hold accused war criminals accountable, ICE stressed that individuals like Garay must be investigated, prosecuted and expelled from the United States.\n\"Individuals who have committed atrocities overseas will not find safe haven in the United States,\" Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security John K. Tien said in the statement.\n(Reporting by Nelson Renteria; Writing by Valentine Hilaire; Editing by David Alire Garcia and Rosalba O'Brien)",

Beijing is giving him the cold shoulder. \n The Biden administration called off Blinken’s planned trip to Beijing in February after a Chinese spy balloon traversed U.S. skies, but has since been trying to restart high-level talks. That includes rescheduling the Blinken visit, and setting up other trips by top U.S. officials and a phone call between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a current U.S. official and a former State Department official said. \nBut China is rebuffing the U.S. efforts, the people said, and its willingness to fully engage may hinge on the drama around Wednesday’s meeting in California between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy .\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Blinken Can’t Reschedule His Trip to China After Canceling (Antiwar.com)\n\n \nWNU Editor: All of my contacts in China are saying the same thing.
