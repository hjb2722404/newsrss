By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

The vote that leaves him in suspense, and could do more to change his policies, will occur eight months later in the United States.\nPutin has publicly said he prefers US President Joe Biden to his predecessor and aspiring successor Donald Trump, a remark widely interpreted to mean exactly the opposite, as the former KGB man hopes his notoriety will boost the Republican mogul.\nTrump has voiced admiration for Putin, raged against NATO, the alliance founded to defend against Moscow, and boasted that he within one day would end the war in Ukraine, which Russia invaded two years ago.\nTrump supporters in Congress, seizing on an unrelated dispute over migration, have held up approval of $60 billion in military…",

The concerns particularly relate to inconsistences with Princess Charlotte’s sleeve and hand. The news did little to put to bed speculation surrounding Kate’s condition, about which the palace has shared few details aside from saying it is not cancer-related.\nThe 42-year-old princess, whose husband Prince William is heir to the British throne, has been recovering mainly at their home in Windsor, west of London, since leaving hospital on January 29.\nThe photo released by Kensi…",
