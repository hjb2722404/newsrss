By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

European Central Bank policymakers delivered another interest rate increase as anticipated, with eurozone consumer prices still rising fast.  But ECB chief Christine Lagarde sent dovish signals, leaving open the possibility of a pause in its streak of rate hikes as the eurozone's economic outlook has deteriorated.

This is in line with a report last month that the field of NGAD combat jet competitors had shrunk from three to two, with the remaining pair widely believed to be Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company has left open the possibility of joining another NGAD team led by a different prime contractor. \nKathy Warden, Northrop Grumman's CEO, spoke of her company's current strategy around the Air Force's multi-faceted NGAD program during an earning call earlier today. In May, the service announced it had formally released a classified contract solicitation for the engineering and manufacturing phase of the development of the NGAD combat jet. This aircraft is ostensibly intended to replace the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, but is expected to have significantly more expansive capabilities that go well beyond a traditional fighter concept.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Lockheed and Boeing are the only companies bidding on this new fighter jet ....

Another incident occurred Wednesday over northwest Syria and resulted in damage to one of the drone’s wings. \nThat makes for a reported total of six incidents involving Russian and American aircraft in July. The confrontations were a reminder of the potential dangers of U.S. and Russian forces operating in close proximity to each other in Syria, and they raise the question of why U.S. forces are still operating in a country where they have no legal mandate. \nRead more .... \nRussia And U.S. Tensions Escalating In The Skies Over Syria\n\n \nRussia, U.S. Inch Toward Direct Conflict in Middle East -- Newsweek\n \nRussian fighter jets stirring up trouble, US combat drones pay price -- Business Insider\n \nRussia says US-led coalition violated Syrian airspace 8 times in 1 day -- Anadolu Agency\n \nRussia Blames US MQ-9 Reaper Drone For Locking Missiles, Almost Crashing Into Su-34, Su-35 Fighters Over Syria -- EurAsian Times\n \nRussian Fighter Damages a Second MQ-9 Over Syria.
