The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Former city police chief Mark Saunders came in third with 8.6 percent.\nAn immigrant who arrived in Canada at the age of 13, Chow takes charge of Toronto at a time when the city of 2.7 million is struggling with a surge in rents, a massive budget deficit and public safety concerns.\nThe previous mayor of Toronto, John Tory, resigned in February after admitting to having had an extramarital affair with an employee.\nDuring the election campaign, Ontario Premier Doug Ford had backed Saunders, saying a Chow victory would be an \"unmitigated disaster.\"\nMonday evening, however, Ford congratulated Chow on her election as Toronto's mayor.\n\"Throughout Olivia's life, she has proven her desire and dedication to serving the city that many of us call home,\" the conservative premier said.\n\"While we're not always going to agree on everything, what we can agree on is our shared commitment to making Toronto a place where businesses, families, and workers can thrive,\" he said in a social media post.\nA former member of parliament for the New Democratic Party, Chow, 66, previously served as a city councilor in Toronto.",

On Friday, the head of the powerful Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, accused the Russian military of attacking his forces and began a march on Moscow — but the revolt quickly fizzled out. By Saturday, Wagner troops had returned to base, and Prigozhin had agreed to exile in Belarus, while Putin denounced the episode as “treason.” Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School and the great-granddaughter of former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, says that while Putin has reasserted his control over the state for now, the episode “didn’t rea…",

He's an economic disaster zone. The only thing he ever had was energy to sell the world and the Europeans have walked away from that.\"\n\"It looks as if he's really in a very weakened position,\" he added. \"I think the internal part was the biggest threat to him.\"\nWatch below or at the link:\n\n\nMSNBC 06 25 2023 10 10 01\n\nyoutu.be",

          "description": "China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\n\n            \nSmall Wars Journal−El Centro Fellow Pablo A. Baisotti has published a research paper on Chinese influence operations in Latin America. The paper, \"China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\" was published by the Florida International University's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy,\nAbstract: This paper analyzes the expansion of Chinese media and public diplomacy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Through its “discourse of power” and an attempt to extend its soft power across the continent, Chinese and some LAC media (print, audiovisual, and digital) sustained, amplified, and exalted the “achievements” of the Communist regime and the possibility of sharing them as a “community of common destiny” for all the world’s peoples. China strives to promote a positive image through communication and propaganda campaigns, incorporating LAC journalists, academics, politicians, and others who can improve its image as a reliable and supportive partner of the “Global South.”\nSource:  Pablo Baisotti, \"China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\" (2023). Research Publications. 55, https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/jgi_research/55.\nZFTWARNING\nTue, 06/27/2023 - 9:05pm\n\nRead more about China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\nLog in or register to post comments",
