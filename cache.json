By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Last month, the United States restricted visas to officials from Uganda who implement a new law that carries potential death sentences for homosexual relations.\nPresident Joe Biden promised on taking office in 2021 to advocate forcefully at home and abroad for LGBTQ rights, although US diplomats often say a quiet approach is more effective.",
