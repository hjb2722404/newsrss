          "description": "Brian Mann covers the U-S opioid and fentanyl crisis for NPR. That means he talks to a lot of people struggling with addiction. Again and again, he's heard stories of people who have succumbed to their addiction — last year 112, 000 — more than ever in history.   \nBut when Mann traveled to Portugal to report on that country's model for dealing with the opioid crisis, he heard a very different story. Overdose deaths in Portugal are extremely rare.\nThe country has taken a radically different approach to drugs – decriminalizing small amounts and publicly funding addiction services – including sites where people can use drugs like crack and heroin. \nPortugal treats addiction as an illness rather than a crime. No one has to pay for addiction care, and no one scrambles to navigate a poorly regulated recovery system. Could Portugal's approach help the U-S fight its opioid epidemic?\nFor sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.  \nEmail us at considerthis@npr.org.",

          "description": "Chile will once again try to resolve the mystery of what really killed the Nobel laureate poet Pablo Neruda, who many believe was poisoned by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a court said Tuesday.\nThe appeals court ordered the reopening of the investigation into the death of Neruda, who was a prominent member of Chile's Communist Party when military dictator Augusto Pinochet took power in 1973.\nIn a statement, the court said that the \"investigation has not been exhausted as there are precise procedures that can be carried out to clarify the facts.\"\nNeruda had been preparing to flee into exile in Mexico to lead the resistance against the Pinochet regime when he died in hospital just 12 days after the coup.\nThe government claimed the 69-year-old had died of prostate cancer.\nAn investigation into the cause of Neruda's death began in 2011 when Manuel Araya -- his driver and personal assistant -- asserted that the poet was given a mysterious injection in his chest just before he died.\nAraya died in June last year, aged 77.\nIn 2017, a group of Chilean and international experts concluded that Neruda did not die of cancer, but said they could not determine what did kill him.\nAnd in 2023, a scientific panel investigating Neruda's death was also unable to determine whether he had been poisoned, even though they detected dangerous botulism-causing bacteria in his system.\nJudge Paola Plaza ordered the probe to be closed in December 2023, but Neruda's family and the Communist Party appealed that decision soon after.\nNeruda is remembered especially for sensual poems about love.\nHowever, in recent years his romantic image has been tainted after his admission in his posthumous memoirs that he had raped a woman came to light after the emergence of the #MeToo movement.\nPinochet, who ruled Chile for 17 years, oversaw a regime that killed some 3,200 leftist activists and other suspected opponents.\nThe dictator died in 2006 aged 91 without ever being convicted for crimes committed by his regime.\n© 2024 AFP",

          "description": "Twitter on Tuesday suspended the account of Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny.\nAccording to Sky News, it is not clear why Navalnaya's account was suspended, and her latest posts were demands to the Russian government to return her late husband's body.\nThe account was suspended for roughly an hour, though as of this writing, it appears to be back online.\nTwitter CEO Elon Musk has a long history of attacking American foreign policy when it comes to aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia, although it's not known at this point if Musk had any role in the decision to suspend Navanaya's account.\nThe death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has further diminished a rapidly shrinking Russian opposition, which has seen its members assassinated, sentenced to lengthy prison terms or forced into exile as Russian President Vladimir Putin makes it clear he will not tolerate challenges to his regime.\nIt was widely feared that Alexei Navalny was risking his life by positioning himself as Putin’s most vocal critic in an increasingly repressive Russia, even challenging him for the presidency in 2018.\nNavalny narrowly survived being poisoned with novichok – a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union – in 2020 and spent months recuperating in Germany. He earned admiration from Russia's disparate opposition for voluntarily returning to Russia the following year.\nHis death comes just a day before the official launch of campaigning ahead of a new round of presidential elections set for March 15-17.\nPutin oversaw changes to the constitution in 2021 that will allow him to run for two more six-year terms, meaning he could stay in power until 2036. Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.\nOn December 8 Putin announced his candidature for re-election and is widely expected to win, given the lack of political alternatives and the Kremlin's iron grip on the state apparatus.\nWith AFP.",

At the height of the Cold War, there were more than 1,000 silos dotting the western United States. The latest iteration, the Minuteman III, was first deployed in 1970. Over the last 40 years, the Air Force has spent billions on replacing guidance systems, rocket motors, and power systems, in addition to patching up aging launch facilities and maintaining an outdated command and control system.
