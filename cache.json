The Online News Act, part of a global trend, passed in June, and the government is finalizing rules expected by December 19.",

The negotiations aim to end decades of armed strife between the authorities and the New People's Army (NPA), the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). If successful, the rebels will transform into a political movement. The announcement comes after the recent amnesty order granted by Ferdinand Marcos Jr to former members of the communist movement, absolving them of crimes committed in pursuit of political beliefs.",

Turning to the upcoming COP28, The UN Climate Change Conference, Mr. Grossi was thrilled to share the key role nuclear energy has been playing in the world's efforts to protect the environment, battle climate change and transition to cleaner energy across the globe. \"For the first time, at the COP, the countries that use nuclear energy are going to say, 'nuclear energy is part of the solution we really need.'\"",

The book is set in a dystopian Dublin in the grips of totalitarianism. Some of the themes of \"Prophet Song\" are eerily similar to the riots that broke out in Dublin last week. \"Prophet Song\" also echoes the violence in Palestine, Ukraine and Syria, and the experience of all those who flee from war-torn countries. The author speaks to FRANCE 24's culture editor Eve Jackson about winning the most prestigious literature prize in the English-speaking world, writing the Irish offspring of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" – and what he's spending his prize money on.",

According to President Joe Biden's administration, investigators foiled another plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States.\nAmong the most startling details in the Justice Department's statement is an alleged revelation from Gupta to an undercover DEA agent that another Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, \"was also the target.\" \nIn fact, he revealed, \"We have so many targets.\"\nALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.\nSikh groups, including some active in the United States and Canada, have vocally advocated for their own state to be parsed out of India. \nThe Diplomat detailed leaked Pakistani documents it says point to an assassination program being orchestrated by India, though the site claimed the leak is attempting to capitalize on India's negative publicity. \nThe Intercept's report last week also cited the same intelligence assessment, saying that the Indian government's \"Research and Analysis Wing\" has been plotting a global assassination plot in several countries in a coordinated effort to target Sikh and Kashmiri activists abroad. \nRead the full court filing by the DOJ here.",

          "description": "Former Middle East adviser to the Pentagon Jasmine El-Gamal says the alleged death of a 10-month-old hostage is a tragic incident and won’t derail Israel’s ultimate objective of trying to get as many hostages home. \n\n“Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated again and again that his number one objective from day one … has been to get the hostages out, as many hostages as possible,” Ms El-Gamal told Sky News Australia.\n\n“It’s a tragic incident if it is true, but I don’t see it derailing the ultimate, larger objective of trying to get every hostage home.”\n\nMs El-Gamal’s remarks come after Hamas reported that the 10-month-old baby, the youngest hostage held in Gaza, was killed alongside his mother and brother in an Israeli airstrike. \n\nThe claims are yet to be verified and are being investigated by Israel's Defence Force.",

The meeting, originally scheduled for last week, was postponed over disagreements about production. \nA deal for further cuts isn’t assured, and the prospect is facing significant resistance within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

In Bas-Artibonite, the focus of the UN report and the center of Haitian rice production located some 100 kilometers from the capital, there are now more than 20 “extremely violent” criminal groups fighting for turf, it says.

But his attempt to instill fear among Russia's neighbors that they are next is not producing the result that he is hoping for. These countries are more focused on increasing their defenses, and will not intervene directly in the current war.",

President Volodymyr Zelensky, once seen as a beacon of hope against corruption, is now ensnared in a scandal involving the alleged purchase of two luxury yachts, “Lucky Me” and “My Legacy,” worth a combined $75 million. This lavish expenditure, facilitated in the opulent settings of Abu Dhabi and Antibes, starkly contrasts with Ukraine’s dire war reality and raises damning questions about the integrity and criminal liability of its leadership amidst heavy reliance on Western aid.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Photos: Ukrainian President Zelensky Accused of Using Proxies to Hide Ownership of $75M Yachts – The Yachts’ Names Are an Insult to All American Taxpayers (Defiant America)\n\n \nWNU Editor: My friends in Ukraine tell me this is just the tip of the iceberg.",

Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday that under international maritime norms and laws, when there is a distress signal, “all vessels in the vicinity, are required to come and help and support.” Though Ryder added that there were three Chinese Navy vessels in the vicinity that “did not respond.” \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: No kidding ....

William Walldorf, Jr., Real Clear Wire: Time to Drawdown From Syria \nAs part of the fallout from the war in Gaza, U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq have come under attack more than fifty times from Iranian-backed militias since early October.  At least fifty-six military personnel have been injured. In response, the U.S. launched retaliatory air strikes and has sent about 900 more troops to the region. \nThis bolstering of forces is the wrong move. In fact, the U.S. is overdue to drawdown its forces from Syria. \nWhy drawdown completely?  The answer is simple.  The small contingent of U.S. forces in Syria, especially, are sitting ducks for further attacks in support of missions where the costs of continuing those missions now far outstrip their strategic benefits.  Recent attacks bring this mismatch between costs and benefits into sharp relief.  These incidents should also serve as a warning for potential dangers if U.S. policy fails to change course.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The U.S. is not going to withdraw any of its forces from Syria. Especially now. The mindset in Washington DC right now is that any withdrawal of US forces in the Middle East will be seen as a sign of weakness .... and they are probably right.",
