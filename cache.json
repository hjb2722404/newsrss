A truck arrives from the Bucha town morgue — inside, the remains of 20 unidentified bodies. It's the third such burial at the town cemetery in the last week. Father Andriy stands alone among the dead — there are no relatives here to mourn their passing. As they are lowered into the ground, he is here to ensure they will not be forgotten.\n\"It is very important for us to bury them with dignity, not just to bury them as bodies, but to bury them as people with the hope of resurrection from the dead,\" says the Orthodox priest. \nSix months after the massacre in Bucha, the scene at the cemetery is the beginning of a process of closure. However, it won't be complete until every last body has been identified and the relatives informed",

Marin, who became the world's youngest serving government leader in December 2019, said she knew she was being filmed but never thought the videos would become publicly available.\n\"These videos are private and filmed in a private space. I resent that these became known to the public,\" Marin told reporters. She said she did not know who leaked them.\nMany Finns have voiced support for the young leader for combining a private life with her high-profile career. But newspaper Helsingin Sanomat said the episode raised questions about her judgement.\n\"Marin may have acted in good faith, but this gullible she should not be,\" the paper wrote in an editorial.\n\"The prime minister can, in a sensitive situation, put the weapons of information warfare in the hands of those who would like to hurt Finland,\" the newspaper said.\nMarin said the video was a compilation of clips from two separate occasions a few weeks ago. She said people at the events consumed alcohol but no one took drugs to her knowledge.\n\"We just partied, also in a boisterous way. I danced and sang,\" Marin said, denying a claim that the videos had been a publicity stunt less than a year until the next general election.\nMarin in January told Reuters she and her fellow young female ministers have been targeted with extensive hate speech for their gender and appearance while in office. \n(REUTERS)",

          "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has suggested that racism is behind a lack of international attention being paid to the plight of civilians in Ethiopia's war-shattered Tigray region.\nCalling it the \"worst humanitarian crisis in the world\", with 6 million people unable to access basic services, Tedros questioned in an emotional appeal why the situation is not getting the same attention as the Ukraine conflict.\n\"Maybe the reason is the colour of the skin of the people,\" Tedros, who is from Tigray, told a virtual media briefing on Wednesday. In April this year at a briefing, he questioned whether \"black and white lives\" in emergencies worldwide are given equal attention.\nWHO emergencies director Mike Ryan also hit out at an apparent shortage of concern about the drought and famine unfolding in the Horn of Africa, and the ensuing health crisis.\n\"No one seems to give a damn about what's happening in the Horn of Africa,\" said Ryan, speaking at a virtual media briefing on Wednesday.\nThe WHO called for $123.7 million to tackle the health problems resulting from growing malnutrition in the region, where around 200 million people live and millions are going hungry.\n(Reporting by Jennifer Rigby; Editing by Hugh Lawson)",

Others take the figure as a shock.  We don’t dispute the number, but that’s not the way to look at it.\nThere’s no doubt that it takes money to feed, clothe and educate a family these days, and inflation doesn’t help.  But children are not just cost centers.  Even ignoring human affection and thinking in the most utilitarian terms, children are assets to the families that raise them, to the nation they were born into, and to the world to which they will contribute throughout their lives. .\n\nA bizarre idea we sometimes hear is that young people don’t want to have children for fear of climate change.  To have children or not, it’s your choice.  But bringing another person into the world won’t matter for global temperatures.  That is, unless your child becomes the adult who finds a solution to battery storage, or some other technological or commercial breakthrough that improves the human condition. \nA real cause for concern is the declining birth rate in the United States that falls below the replacement rate.  Without immigration, the American population would begin to decline.  It’s nothing to cheer about.  Whatever the cost of raising children, they are an invaluable vote of confidence in the future.\n\n\n          Not a single Republican senator voted for the so-called “Cut Inflation Act,” but Democrats are ignoring the warning signs and pushing ahead with their tax-and-spend agenda.

It comprises a master bedroom with a double bathroom and fitted wardrobes, including a “shoe wall”.  There’s also a morning bar with a library area, a theater, a gym, a chef’s kitchen, lots of marble, and even space for a gift-wrapping room. \nFago, who made his fortune in the nursing home sector, also seems to have a particular preference for the color pink.

We asked a top Russia expert to break down what you need to know: \nAs the owner of the world’s largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, both strategic and tactical, the question of Russian use of nuclear weapons is understandably a matter of latent concern in Western capitals. While Russia has not shown a serious indication of an intention to use its tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefields of Ukraine other than some saber rattling in the first weeks of the war, Russia’s tactical nuclear arsenal remains operational and a matter of concern.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I was worried at the beginning of the Russia - Ukraine war that Russia may use a battlefield nuclear weapon to hasten a quick surrender from the Zelensky government. Fortunately that did not happen. \nBut if Russia does officially declare war against Ukraine and orders a mass mobilization of the population, I am sure these weapons will be deployed, and they will used as a threat against NATO to stay out of the conflict.",

There are some stark facts that must be acknowledged: \n1) Ukraine’s air force is inactive. Whatever still exists is not providing close air support to besieged Ukrainian troops or carrying out aerial attacks against Russian positions. \n2) Ukraine’s rotary wing aircraft–i.e., helicopters–also is inactive. Only a few helicopters remain and they rarely venture to the front. They are not hitting Russian truck and tank columns wit…",

They might not know much else about Ukraine, but they know it’s the kind of place where just being the son of the vice president of the United States can get you an $83,000 monthly paycheck for sitting on the board of an energy company. \nNo one knows this better than Ukrainians themselves, who have to put up with a level of official corruption on par with countries like Mexico and Gabon. Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Ukraine 122 out of 180 countries worldwide, and the second most corrupt country in Europe — right after Russia.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Being someone whose nationality is partly Ukrainian and who has many family members and friends who are still in Ukraine, I know too well that the culture of corruption is unfortunately endemic in Ukrainian society. Many in Ukraine are going to prosper in this war, even if the country gets completely destroyed in the process. And as for all of this aid being shipped to Ukraine. I would not be surprised if a third of it is being skimmed off for bribes and pay-offs. And as for the tens of billions that are being loaned to Kyiv and even more promised for the future. Here is an easy prediction. That money is never going to be paid back.",
