In Primary School, specialist and homeroom teachers integrate STEAM into each unit of inquiry, encouraging students to connect and apply investigating and problem solving skills across subject areas. As they move into Secondary School, students further develop their fact gathering, problem defining, opportunity sensing, risk analysis and solution creating skills through both individual and collaborative student-led projects. The school’s award-winning campus offers fully equipped laboratories, design technology workshops and visual art studios, offering opportunities for hands-on and digital creative experiences.  Students are inspired to take responsible ecological and conservation-driven action by the school’s many cutting edge features.\r \r \r Mandarin and World Language Programme\r \r Expression through more than one language is a fundamental element of an IB education and an advantage in our highly connected world.

The seller was Kim Sapersteinthe daughter of a former Bear Stearns financier, and her former boyfriend, Andrew Frankel, who is now married to Tom Brady’s exBrigitte Moynahan. \nThe remodeled 6,000 square foot home began with a $5.1 million purchase in 2011 by Saperstein and Frankel.  Then they added a $6.2 million unit above in 2015. \nThe house opens onto a gallery that leads to a large living and dining room with 10 foot ceilings and a gas fireplace, overlooking the private gardens of the iconic mansions.  There is also a private office and a chef’s kitchen with a table that seats eight, according to the list. \nThe pre-war duplex is on the 10th and 11th floors of 33 E. 70th St., off Fifth Avenue.

          "description": "Queen Elizabeth II is still dead, several American media continued to confirm it on Monday.\nThe 96-year-old British monarch died on Thursday, ending a 70-year reign.  Her death sparked a relentless barrage of media coverage about her and the royal family – not just in the UK, but in the US, which has said no to the monarchy.\nYet despite this innate aversion to hereditary aristocracy as a guiding principle, the American media covered the death of Elizabeth, the rise of her son King Charles IIIand all the mini-dramas around it, but ultimately stupid.\nThe most incredible part is that the British throne wields little real political power, thus making it all a largely aesthetic matter.  We’re actually talking about ‘optics’, and in one of the most superficial ways imaginable.\nLogging on Monday,…",

Photo: Mauricio Campino/U.S. Air Force \nThe Intercept: U.S. Military Aid to Ukraine Grows to Historic Proportions — Along With Risks  \nUkraine is on track to become the largest recipient of U.S military assistance in the last century. But questions surround the policy. \nSince Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February, the U.S. government has pumped more money and weapons into supporting the Ukrainian military than it sent in 2020 to Afghanistan, Israel, and Egypt combined — surpassing in a matter of months three of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid in history. \nKeeping track of the numbers is challenging. Since the war started, U.S. officials have announced a flurry of initiatives aimed at supporting Ukrainian defense efforts while keeping short of a more direct involvement in the conflict. On Thursday, on a surprise visit to Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new $675 million package of U.S. military equipment as well as a $2.2 billion “long-term” investment to bolster the security of Ukraine and 17 of its neighbor countries. Weeks earlier, President Joe Biden unveiled a $3 billion aid package, the largest yet, symbolically choosing Ukraine’s Independence Day for the announcement. The administration noted on that occasion that the total military assistance committed to Ukraine this year had reached $12.9 billion, more than $15.5 billion since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. And this month, Biden also asked Congress to authorize an additional $13.7 billion for Ukraine, including money for equipment and intelligence. \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: This is very telling and a clear indication on how committed the U.S. is in this war ....  \n.... the U.S. government has pumped more money and weapons into supporting the Ukrainian military than it sent in 2020 to Afghanistan, Israel, and Egypt combined.",
