José Ricardo Orozco told local Blu Radio. “Four people have died, as of this moment: two women, a man and a minor.”\nMayor Juan Carlos Tamayo said 800 spectators were seated in the sections that collapsed.\nLate Sunday, Tolima health secretary Martha Palacios said in a press conference that 322 people had gone to local public and private hospitals after the collapse seeking treatment. Palacio said the minor who had died was an 18-month-old baby.\nBesides the four dead, another four people were in intensive care and two others recovering from surgery.\nOrozco said he had asked for the traditional “corralejas” to be suspended in Tolima earlier Sunday but this one was held anyway.\nPresident-elect Gustavo Petro urged local officials to ban such events, noting that it was not the first time an incident like this had taken place.\n“I ask mayors not to allow more events involving the death of people or animals,” he said.\nCurrent President Iván Duque on Twitter announced an investigation of the disaster.\n“We lament the terrible tragedy registered in El Espinal, Tolima, during the festivals of San Pedro and San Juan, with the collapse of the stands during a corraleja.

But new this year is a return to the great interior.  In 2020, the double blow of the pandemic and a fire that ravaged one of the two halls of the festival forced the cancellation of all performances.  Last year the shows were outdoors, weather permitting.  The main stage — the barn that festival founder Ted Shawn converted into the first theater in the United States dedicated to dance 80 years ago — was undergoing necessary renovations.\nThe Ted Shawn Theater is open for business again, half of its weathered, historic-looking wood exterior, the other half clean and new.

          "description": "In “Accepted,” director Dan Chen takes us into the world of TM Landry, a private school in Louisiana whose videos of African-American students garnering Ivy League college acceptances have gone viral.  But nine months after the filmmakers’ first visit to the school, the New York Times published reports of physical abuse, tampered transcripts and “bigoted” behavior from its founders, Mike and Tracey Landry.  “Accepted” viewers get a front-row seat to experience the shattering impact of the school’s collapse through the stories of four promising high school students: Adia, Alicia, Cathy and Issac.\nAs we watch both the documentary’s subjects — and its director — navigate shocking real-time development, a quiet probing film emerges that pierces the mythos of America’s meritocracy.\n\n\nChen makes the choice to walk at the same measured pace throughout — even after the TM Landry scandal came to light — and forgo the cryptic notation we’re used to hearing when the jig is up.  Likewise, Chen and Daphne Qin Wu’s cinematography seamlessly oscillates between intimate handheld shots and aerial views of western Louisiana landscapes that reflect the eventual loss of access to the Landrys and the ‘school.\n\n\nUltimately, it’s the resilience of the film’s teenage subjects that elevates “Accepted” to new heights.  As they sit for close-ups in front of a swirling blue backdrop, the Georgetown and Stanford sweatshirts are gone, and the hopes they once held.  But in their place is a clear understanding of the misguided pressures on individual minority students to succeed in a society that systematically disadvantages them, and a surprisingly powerful story about peace with imperfection.\nAccepted\nUnclassified.

As we’ve discussed here repeatedly, however, those allegations and characterizations of the industry are demonstrably false. What we’re dealing with is a lack of refinery capacity. The United States currently has the lowest number of functioning refineries capable of producing gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that we’ve seen since 2016, largely as a result of government policies.

OPEC will be meeting again in the coming days to discuss its export agreements, while today the oil group is presenting its Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) 2022. While the media is likely to be focused on rumors in the next 24 hours of a possible change in the export strategy of OPEC+, the real focus should be on whether or not the oil cartel is even capable of substantially increasing its production.  For years, OPEC producers have been the main swing producers in oil markets. With a presumed spare capacity of more than 3-4 million bpd, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have always been seen as a point of last resort in case of a major crisis in oil and gas markets. \nRead more .... \nUpdate #1: Oil producers usually tame soaring prices by turning on the taps.
