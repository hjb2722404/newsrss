Right now, the field is expanding very quickly in terms of methodology and data collection techniques, so I am confident that demand for data scientists will continue to grow.”\r \r As a result, each September intake for the MSDS admits around 100 students. They are expected to take five core courses and five electives to achieve a total of 30 credits. The foundational modules cover areas such as exploratory data analysis and visualisation, statistical machine learning, and storing and retrieving data. This provides strong training in key aspects of both theory and practice.\r \r The list of electives gives students scope to pick courses…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

House Bill 4293 would ban such marriages. \nThe Michigan state House passed the measure resoundingly, but GOP Reps. Steve Carra, Neil Friske, Matt Maddock, Angela Rigas and Josh Schriver all voted against the measure, Heartland Signal reports on its Twitter feed.\nSo far this century, 5,400 children (under the age of 18) were married in Michigan, but the numbers have declined steadily in recent years, the report said, noting 468 girls married in Michigan in 2000 compared to just 32 in 2021.\nDemocratic Rep. Kara Hope, one of the bill’s sponsors, said, \"It's hard to believe that this practice is still legal in Michigan in the year 2023,\" according to the report. \n\"Victims of child marriage have less stability in their financial situations, more unwanted pregnancies and worse health outcomes,\" it says.\nA United Nations initiative aims to end child marriage by 2030.",

Valerii Zaluzhnyi engaged in war efforts. \n* A mysterious Baby Yoda patch could be spotted on his uniform, and its not exactly clear why. \n* The little patch immediately stoked intrigue and admiration on social media. \nValerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's \"Iron General,\" was spotted this week wearing an unusual new patch. Military uniform patches come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and can carry a wide range of meaning, but his is something of a mystery at the moment. \nUkraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces published a video on Monday showing Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, sporting a Baby Yoda patch in the center of his uniform as he discusses details on the war with other top officials. \nThe new video includes scenes of Zaluzhnyi hovering over blurred-out information and walking alongside individuals whose faces have been censored. A clock on the wall at one point in the video indicates that the footage is from Saturday. \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Video Shows Ukraine Commander, and Baby Yoda Steals the Show (Reuters)\n\n \nWNU Editor: This video was quickly released after Russian President Putin was trolling the General on where he may be ....

But a Baby Yoda patch?!?!? I guess they want to send out the message that the \"Force\" is with them.",
