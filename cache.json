Some taxes will go up,\" he added.\nTax cuts were the centrepiece of the budget announced by Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng on September 23. But they were financed through billions in more borrowing, causing panic on financial markets which has fed into higher costs for British households.\nTruss fired Kwarteng on Friday and rowed back further on the planned tax cuts, but is facing threats of being toppled by senior Conservative MPs aghast at the party's collapse in opinion polls since she replaced Boris Johnson on September 6.\n\"There were mistakes,\" acknowledged Hunt, a former health and foreign secretary who is seen as a centrist Tory brought in by Truss to steady her listing ship.\nKwarteng and Truss had initially wanted to cut taxes for the highest earners, and had presented their budget without independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, Hunt noted in summarizing two key mistakes.\n\"The prime minister's recognized that, that's why I'm here.\"\n(AFP)",

So with the end of DST    approaching, the busy mother says she fears changing the clock. \n“It’s definitely going to mess us up and mess us up over the next few days, even a week,” Shaffer told CBS News. \nShe is not alone.  according to one vote conducted by Monmouth University, six out of 10 Americans said they would rather make daylight saving time permanent — abandoning the practice of changing the clock twice a year created during World War I to save energy.\n\nTurning our clocks back and forth may soon be a thing of the past – if a few lawmakers get their way.\nThis year, Congress brought the issue into the spotlight when the House energy committee heard testimony at a formal hearing about how changing the clock is linked to increased risk of depression, stroke and sleep disorders.  According to National Children’s Hospital sleep specialist Dr.  Tyish Hall Brown, changing watches can have an impact on the body.\n“We have a kind of internal rhythm to our bodies and our health,” Brown said.  “And every time we move forward or backward, that too has to adjust.”\nIn March, the US Senate unanimously legislation passed    without warning to make DST permanent starting in 2023, if the US House and President agree.\nMichigan Congressman Fred Upton said the effort will likely fall short in the House, in part because some people in the western section of the time zones say they are concerned that permanent daylight saving time could make mornings too dark and late. \n“Not only would [school buses] running in the dark, the kids would probably be in the second or third hour while it was still dark,” he said. \nNearly 15 years ago, Upton championed an energy-saving law that extended DST    even later in November. \n“Particularly with global warming, climate change is real,” he said.  “Why not take advantage of this extra hour of sunlight?”\n    \n      \nSource Link",

Do you want to fight? Let’s fight. Fuck you. Fuck you, and your aborted bitch daughter.”\nThe Jan. 6 attacks, Trump’s coup plot, and narcissism fueled the perpetrators’ decision-making process, and a documentary film crew followed them, giving us an insight into how Trump and those around him operate.\nRoger Stone was upset that Donald Trump refused to grant him a second pardon, ostensibly to cover up his activities in the 1/6 attack.\nHere’s the Stone video from the documentary filmmaker who posted the above footage, released by the committee on Thursday, Jan. 6:\n\nRecently, the select committee obtained footage of Roger Stone before and after the election. pic.twitter.com/6mRdWwMSmE\n— January 6 Committee (@January6thCmte) October 13, 2022\n\nEven before yesterday’s hearing, Zachary Petrizzo was the daily beast Stone ‘threatened to file a $25 million lawsuit against Danish filmmakers – Frederick Mabel and Christopher Gould Branson – who took his picture in November, saying’ Fuck the vote and let’s face violence.'”\nStone may return to the prison where he belongs. Trump’s longtime adviser is a go-between for the Trump campaign and Russia, and has performed the same functions for Trump on 1/6 with the militia.\nThe failed former president was surrounded by criminal associates like Roger Stone who were only interested in himself.\n\n\nSource: Politicususa.com",
