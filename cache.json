          "description": "China's hospitals have been struggling to keep up amid soaring coronavirus cases after the Chinese Communist Party abruptly reversed its stringent \"zero Covid\" policy while the country's vaccination rate remains low. FRANCE 24 correspondents Lou Kisiela, Antoine Morel, Yan Chen and Yena Lee report from a hospital in Shanghai.\n\nThis hospital is considered one of the best in China, but it is overwhelmed as Covid cases soar. Stretchers and oxygen tanks pile up in the lobby as ambulance after ambulance arrives, day and night. “I am very worried. I feel powerless. It’s very crowded,” said the daughter-in-law of an elderly patient whose condition was alarming. “The hospital is doing its best […] but they are understaffed. The doctors don’t have time to answer our questions.”\n\nMeanwhile, patients with less serious symptoms were waiting for rationed fever medication. Pharmacies have run out of stock, and this hospital can prescribe it at the rate of one dose per person, per day.\n\n“We could’ve stocked up on drugs before lifting all the restrictions. It’s the government’s fault,” said one patient. “Either we are strictly locked down.. or all the measures disappear at once!”",

          "description": "Russian sausage tycoon Pavel Antov was celebrating his birthday at an India hotel, and was later found dead after apparently falling from an open window, the BBC reports. \nA friend who was with him for the trip died at the hotel two days earlier on Friday. As the BBC points out, Antov's death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov's friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have \"consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.\"\nAntov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. \nFrom the BBC: \"Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov's account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: 'It's extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.' The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a 'patriot of my country' and backed the war.\"\nRead the full report over at the BBC.",

The 2007 study, written by the Swedish Defense Research Agency, even posited a scenario: \n“One diver would be enough to set an explosive device.” \nToday, European investigators face almost exactly that scenario. The Swedish authorities leading a criminal investigation have concluded that a state actor was most likely responsible for a September blast that ripped through the gas pipes. Officials and experts say that explosives were probably dropped from ships or — just as the Swedish report warned — planted on the seafloor using submarines or divers.   \nRead more .... \n WNU Editor: I love the mental gymnastics that the New York Times goes through to try and blame Russia for destroying a pipeline that it spent 10 years to plan and $23 billion to build with the expectation of receiving almost a trillion in revenues over the course of its lifetime. \nBut we all know who was to gain (and is gaining) from this attack. \n\nAt least the Washington Post coverage of this story is more balanced and straight to the point ....

          "description": "A fire at the Russian Aerospace Forces' Central Scientific Research Institute in Tver in April, via TASS.  \nJack Murphy: The CIA is using a European NATO ally’s spy service to conduct a covert sabotage campaign inside Russia under the agency’s direction, according to former U.S. intelligence and military officials. \nThe campaign involves long standing sleeper cells that the allied spy service has activated to hinder Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine by waging a secret war behind Russian lines. \n Years in the planning, the campaign is responsible for many of the unexplained explosions and other mishaps that have befallen the Russian military industrial complex since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, according to three former U.S. intelligence officials, two former U.S. military officials and a U.S. person who has been briefed on the campaign. The former officials declined to identify specific targets for the CIA-directed campaign, but railway bridges, fuel depots and power plants in Russia have all been damaged in unexplained incidents since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February.    \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: Report: The CIA Is Directing Sabotage Attacks Inside Russia (Antiwar.com)   \nWNU Editor: The Nord Stream pipeline attack was the wake-up call for everyone on what was (and is) happening. What concerns me is when is the blow-back going to happen. You can take this to the bank. The Kremlin is going to retailiate.\n\nAnd as to who is that NATO ally that the CIA is using to conduct this covert sabotage campaign. I agree with Jeffrey Kaye (see tweet below) that it is probably Poland. \n\nThe CIA is using a European NATO ally’s spy service to conduct a covert sabotage campaign inside Russia under the agency’s direction, according to former U.S. intelligence and military officials.\n-> My guess is secret NATO ally here is Poland! https://t.co/3A10CsZpH0\n— Jeffrey Kaye (@jeff_kaye) December 25, 2022",
