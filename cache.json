It reveals the extent of child poverty in these countries and how these cases vary from middle-to-high income countries. Titled <em>Child Poverty in the Midst of Wealth</em>, this report is the latest in the Innocenti Report Card series, which observe children’s well-being in high-income countries. Within these countries, over 69 million children were living in households earning less than 60 percent of the average national income level. Across these countries, there was a reported 8 percent decrease in poverty levels between 2014 to 2021. During this period of relative prosperity, countries took this as an opportunity to address child poverty with varying levels of success.\nOf the countries assessed for this report, Slovenia, Poland, Finland and Denmark reported child poverty reduction rates that exceeded 30 percent. By contrast, higher-income countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and France, reported a high percentage of child poverty, and even saw these rates increase in recent years.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/12/12/35558\">Read the full story, “The Solutions to Child Poverty Must Reach the Most Vulnerable Communities”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Thom Tillis (R-NC) told reporters that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky faced off against conspiracy theories while meeting members of Congress Tuesday — including one that he used aid from the United States to buy a $75 million yacht. \nThe Associated Press reported in September that a conspiracy theory broke out on social media when someone posted a YouTube video claiming \"Ukrainian President Zelensky uses proxies to hide ownership of two yachts worth $75,000,000.\" \nThe account hasn't posted any other videos. According to the BBC, the source was \"very suspect\" and has no other presence anywhere online. \nThe company selling the yachts also confirmed to the AP that it wasn't true. \n“We can confirm that the yacht has not been sold and therefore remains for sale,\" the company's spokesperson, Nicci Perides, told the AP.\nALSO READ: Mention ‘Liz Cheney 2024’ and things get very, very awkward on Capitol Hill\nBut the conspiracy that spread online is now apparently influencing whether or not Republicans will back Zelensky's request for funds necessary to continue fighting off Russia. \nFox reporter Chad Pergram paraphrased Tillis saying in passing that, \"It was helpful that President Zelensky focused on some of the myths around yachts being bought with the money coming from the United States.\"\nTillis went on to say that he and others are aware of what is happening on the ground in Ukraine and he is confident that the money is being sent properly. He cautioned that if lawmakers failed to support Ukraine, the U.S. would be spending a lot more money if they walked away from them.",

          "description": "French lawmakers sent the government’s immigration bill back to the drawing board on Monday, in a surprise move that cut short debates at the lower house and dealt a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to pass laws without a majority.\nLawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far right party as well as many conservatives joined forces to reject the bill on its first day in the National Assembly, adopting a motion proposed by the Greens, which passed by just two votes.\nThe rejection does not mean the government needs to resign and does not signal the end of the immigration bill.\nThe government can now decide to send it back to the upper house, send it to a joint committee of senators and deputies to find a compromise, or pull it, which is unlikely.\nIt can also use special executive powers to force its adoption without a vote.\nThe immigration bill has been a key plank of Macron’s attempts to show he can be tougher on law and order issues while keeping France’s doors open to foreign workers who can help the French economy.\nBut short of a majority in parliament, he has struggled to pass a bill that has strict provisions disliked by left-wing lawmakers and more liberal aspects criticised by some conservatives and the far right.\nThe government has presented the bill as essential to expel foreign criminals more easily. One provision removes a ban on expelling those migrants who arrived in France before the age of 13, as was the case for the alleged Russian-born Islamist militant who killed a French teacher in October.\nOther provisions that have been hotly debated are whether non-EU migrants should continue to get access to free medical coverage in France, as well as the government’s aim to facilitate the legalisation of workers in industries suffering from labour shortages such as cafes and restaurants.\n(Reuters)",

          "description": "Thomas Fazi, UnHerd: Is this the end for Zelenskyy?\n\n \nThe Ukrainian president is facing calls for regime change \n Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Western public has been sold the story of a Ukrainian front united in its unwavering commitment to a total military victory over Russia. Over the past few weeks, however, this narrative has started to crumble. \nDespite the failure of Ukraine’s Nato-backed counteroffensive, which is now universally accepted, Zelenskyy continues to stick to the maximalist victory-at-all-costs narrative — that Ukraine must go on fighting until it retakes every inch of lost territory, including Crimea, and that Putin should not be negotiated with. This is understandable: he has staked everything on achieving that objective — anything less would probably mean the end of his political career.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: I personally think his position is secure for the next few months. He has the support of the West, and more importantly, the personal support of President Biden. Replacing him right now will be a military and political disaster for the West, and an admission that their support for Ukraine has failed.\n\nBut back in Ukraine all of my friends/contacts/and family members who have always supported Zelensky are now having doubts not only on where the war is going, but on the leadership of Zelensky. \nThis is something new, and indicates to me that if the war continues to go as bad as it currently is, support for Zelensky is definitely going to be tested by the spring of 2024. Both inside Ukraine and outside.",
