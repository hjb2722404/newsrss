          "description": "Canadian defence minister Bill Blair informed the press on Friday that a Chinese military aircraft discharged flares toward a Canadian helicopter in international waters the previous Sunday. He stated that Ottawa intends to communicate its concerns to Beijing. This marks the second instance within a two-week period where Canada has raised accusations of unsafe conduct by China's air force. In mid-October, Minister Blair reported that a Chinese fighter jet had approached within five meters (approximately 16 feet) of a surveillance aircraft engaged in a United Nations mission.",

The site, now the third largest in Morocco, will provide insights into the lives of Roman settlers and romanised Moroccans during that time. The bath covers an area of over 2000 square meters and resembles imperial counterparts in Rome. The excavation is ongoing to uncover the port and other parts of one of the largest Roman towns in the country.",

          "description": "Every November 1st and 2nd, Mexico holds its largest public celebration: Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, a fusion of Roman Catholic and Indigenous rituals that honor and remember deceased loved ones. Far from a mournful affair, the holiday is a time of celebration and warmth. Correspondent Enrique Acevedo talks with Mexico City's minister of culture Claudia Curiel De Icaza about the city's celebrations; with acclaimed chef Elena Reygadas about baking traditional pan de muerto; and with author Regina Marchi, who has documented the holiday's growing popularity on both sides of the border in her book, \"Day of the Dead in the U.S.A.\"",

Israeli airstrikes hit two refugee camps in the central Gaza Strip on Sunday, killing at least 45 people, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. The strikes came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his Middle-eastern tour with an unannounced visit to Iraq, as Washington tries to prevent a regional spillover. Tensions increased with neighbouring Lebanon as an Israeli strike in the south of the country killed three children and their grandmother, Lebanese authorities said.

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\n\"List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib,\" Greene said on Wednesday. \"This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC.\"\n\nShe created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. \nThey include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. \n\n\tEarlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.\n\"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger,\" she said. \"And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate.\"\nThe media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.\n\"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib,\" tweeted Chat Pergram.\nMelanie Zanona also tweeted: \"motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans.\"\n\nAnd CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: \"House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution.\"",

Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. \nCapitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.\nAfter a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). \nThe news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",

To mark the occasion, the Mint is looking for 75 people turning 75 years old this year, to give them a special £5 coin, in honour of the King’s birthday. To honour the King’s lifelong commitment to sustainability, a special birthday coin has also been made from a blend of silver recovered from industrial and medical x-ray films. Those celebrating their 75th birthday in 2023 can submit their name and contact details via the Royal Mint to be in with a chance of receiving an uncirculated £5 commemorative coin. The winners will be drawn at random and asked to provide photographic evidence of age. They will be contacted via email from early December 2023.",

Siluanov attributes this hopeful outlook to full compensation for last year’s decrease and the stabilization of the ruble exchange rate. \nRebound from Economic Contraction \nThe predicted growth in Russia’s economy marks a recovery from the challenging economic climate of 2022 when the nation grappled with a 2 percent economic decline.

I cannot even express in words on how huge of an impact that is having on the economy as a whole. \nBut the big story on the Russia economy that many in the West have not caught up on is the Kremlin's priority to re-industrialize the country.

          "description": "CNN: US intelligence currently assesses Iran and its proxies are seeking to avoid a wider war with Israel \nThe US intelligence community believes – for now – that Iran and its proxies are calibrating their response to Israel’s military intervention in Gaza to avoid direct conflict with Israel or the US while still exacting costs on its adversaries. \nBut the US is also keenly aware that Iran does not maintain perfect control of its umbrella of proxies – in particular over Lebanese Hezbollah, the largest and most capable of the various groups. Hezbollah is an ally of Hamas, the group that attacked Israel on October 7, and has long positioned itself as fighting against Israel. US officials are deeply concerned that the group’s internal politics may cause Hezbollah to escalate simmering tensions. \nThe US also does not always have perfect visibility into the communications between Iran and its various proxies, according to sources familiar with US intelligence in the region. \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: We shall see if Iran is committed to avoiding a wider war with Israel. But I am skeptical. I do not see any de-escalation in the Israel - Hamas war, and tensions between Israel and Hezbollah continues to remain high. The Houthis in Yemen have already declared war against Israel. It will not take much to spark this into a major regional war.",
