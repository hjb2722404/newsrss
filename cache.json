          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r Imagine applying to 25 of the world’s top universities and getting accepted into all of them. Jamie Beaton did exactly that and that isn’t even the most impressive thing about him. \r \r Beaton graduated from Harvard University in 2016 with a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree two years ahead of schedule. At just 20 years old, he became one of the youngest admits to Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB), arguably the world’s top MBA school. In 2022, he completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford on the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.\r \r But his success story is not just about impressive credentials — he uses his own experience to support other students to reach for the stars as he did. At just 17, Jamie co-founded Crimson Education, now the world's largest and most effective college admissions consulting firm which has supported over 20,000 students to gain offers to the most competitive universities. In Hong Kong alone, Crimson has helped more than 200 students to secure coveted offers from Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Princeton and so on.\r \r Beaton’s success didn’t happen overnight. His journey began in his teenage years, when he fearlessly charged ahead in his interests and academic pursuits.\r \r  \r \r The Making of a Prodigy: Jamie’s Teenage Years\r \r Beaton was no different from the average New Zealand teenager who loved playing video games and going to amusement parks. He had his secondary education at King's College, New Zealand, and planned to study medicine at his home university, the University of Auckland. Everything changed at 15 when he had a chat with a senior, who suggested that Beaton explore options outside Auckland. That’s when he started to shift his focus and set his sights on the Ivy League, Oxbridge, and other top international universities.\r \r Beaton took 10 A-Levels instead of the usual three. With a stellar academic and extracurricular profile, he received offers from all 25 top universities he applied to,…",

By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "A landlord in Canada changed the locks on a home and took votes from its occupants on whether one of the tenants could return, the Daily Hive reported. \nMan-Ling Weng claimed Daichi Araki owed him $4,500 in damages, which Araki disagreed with. \nDetails from a British Columbia small claims case at the Civil Resolution Tribunal say Weng became a tenant at the home in 2019 but took over rent-collecting duties in 2020 as well as other responsibilities. Araki and Weng had an unwritten agreement where Weng payed Araki $600 on a month-to-month basis. \nOn September 21, 2021, Araki allowed Weng’s friend, identified in the Hive's report as \"SJC,\" to stay in her rented bedroom. Weng then increased her rent payments from $600 to $700. Weng then took a trip to Taiwan, and SJC then signed a document post-dated May 24, allowing SJS to stay in Weng’s room to “safeguard her possessions.”\nIN OTHER NEWS: Backfire alert: GOP's anti-'wokeness' crusade could end up undermining their own candidates\nWhen Weng's return date was pushed back to 4 months later, Araki gave Weng until May 31 to move out -- even though Araki didn't initially signal any objections to the extended return date. \nAraki said Weng had “breached their contract by subleasing her room to SJC without his consent.” The court said that this contradicted Araki’s statement allowing SJC to move in.\n\"In the end, Araki was ordered to pay $40 to Weng for a partial rent refund and $130 in damages for $170,\" the Hive's report stated.",

I could have negotiated. At worst, I could've made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could've worked a deal.\"\nBut as Baragona pointed out, that is not what Hannity played.\n\"Instead, shortly after Trump says, 'I could have negotiated,' the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that 'China no longer respects the United States,'\" Baragona observed.\nBaragona also noted that \"besides asserting that he would have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine by making a deal to let them 'take over something,' Trump also said in the portion not aired by Fox that 'so many more people are dying than is being reported' while reiterating this 'would have never happened' under his watch.\"",

          "description": "Boat workers, bus drivers, doctors, teachers and Greek's entire public service sector brought the country to a near halt on Wednesday as strikes erupted in response to a train accident that killed 57.\n\nThe action particularly affected big cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki where traffic was chaotic, ferries remained in their docks and many islands were cut off from the mainland.\nThe country's major trade unions had called for the strike criticizing the government's privatization policy for last week's serious train accident and demanding a full investigation.\nThe deadly crash came after a passenger train ran onto a track on which a cargo train was approaching because of a wrong switch position.\nThe investigation into the accident has already revealed numerous serious mistakes within the state-owned railway company OSE. Critics have said that over the past two decades all governments had criminally neglected the Greek railways.\nFerries are moored in the port of Piraeus during a 24-hour strike. The umbrella organizations of Greek trade unions have called for nationwide strikes in protest at the collision of a passenger train with a freight train in northern Greece that killed 57 people.

One is a detailed close-up of the B-21's nose and cockpit section, the other provides us with the first look at the planform of the secretive new jet, which aims to replace the B-2 and the B-1. \nThe elevated image underscores the B-21's overall layout, which harkens back to what the B-2 would have looked like if requirements for low-level penetration were not introduced mid-way through its development. This planform also would have given the B-2 a substantially higher operating ceiling, which the B-21 will likely achieve. While the image overall is compressed due to the wide angle lens, it still highlights the B-21's smaller proportions compared to its now well over three decades-old progenitor.    \nRead more .... \n U.S. Air Force Releases A Stunning New Image Of The B-21 Stealth Bomber   \nU.S. Air Force Reveals New B-21 Design Details -- Aviation Week  \nBREAKING: U.S. Air Force Has Just Released New B-21 Raider Images -- The Aviationist  \nNew look at US Air Force's B-21 stealth bomber ahead of first flight -- 9News  \nNew images of B-21 stealth bomber emerge ahead of first flight -- Aerospace Manufacturing  \nUSAF Reveals Stunning Images Of B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber -- Zero Hedge",

In early February, maritime vessels disabled the two undersea cables connecting Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, a tiny archipelago just 10 nautical miles off China’s coast, to the internet. Now residents of the islands face highly reduced internet connectivity until the cables are repaired. The activity looks like targeted harassment by Beijing—or an exercise in preparation for cutting off the whole of Taiwan. \nOn Feb. 2, a Chinese fishing vessel sailing close to the Matsu Islands severed one of the two cables, which connect the islands with Taiwan proper. Then, six days later, a Chinese freighter cut the second cable. Speaking shortly after the second cable was cut, Wong Po-tsung, the vice chair of Taiwan’s National Communications Commission, told reporters that there was no indication the incidents were intentional. It’s not uncommon for undersea cables to be damaged—but losing two in a row is either really unfortunate or quite possibly not a coincidence.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Taiwan now strongly believes these cables were deliberately cut ....
