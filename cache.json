I’m not criticizing him for it. Our nation is better off with him away on his medical retreats—I mean vacations,\" said Breanna Morello.\n\n\"41 per cent of Americans have picked up a side job while Joe Biden spent half of August on vacation,\" said Lance Gooden.",

With 96% of the votes counted in Sunday’s plebiscite, the rejection camp had 61.9% support compared to 38.1% for approval amid what appeared to be a heavy turnout with long lines at polling states.
