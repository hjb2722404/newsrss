Robert Card died from a self-inflicted gunshot, which likely occurred eight to 12 hours before his body was found in a tractor-trailer. Concerns about Card's mental state had been raised prior to the shootings, and law enforcement agencies came under scrutiny for not finding his body sooner.",

The gallery, which operates a studio for North Korean artists, showcases the unique socialist realist style of North Korean art that appeals to a niche audience. China's lax enforcement of the sanctions targeting North Korea's nuclear program allows for the continued sale of North Korean art. The art is seen as a form of propaganda, with artists working directly for North Korea's authorities to create art glorifying the state and its ideology.",

          "description": "The city of Raqqa symbolises the tragic fate of Syria over the past 12 years. From the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011, the northern city was a major target for rebel groups. It then became the stronghold of Islamic State group terrorists, who made Raqqa the capital of their self-proclaimed caliphate. The city went through three years of hell – suffering atrocities, public hangings and slave auctions – before being bombed and then liberated in 2017 by an international US-led coalition. Since then, the \"Pearl of the Euphrates\" has struggled to get back on track.",

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). \nThe news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",

Still, it refused to allow the sale of the 4.5th generation Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet to the kingdom, despite the UK government’s intense lobbying. Berlin’s refusal, unfortunately, poses a significant challenge to Britain’s production lines. \nThe United Kingdom is likely to see a loss of 6,000 jobs in the defense sector and no manufacturing of fighter jets for a decade in the face of Germany’s unwillingness to green-light the sale of Eurofighter Typhoon jets to the Royal Saudi Air Force, British newspaper The Sun reported.\nBerlin is blocking a multibillion-dollar agreement to sell 48 Typhoons to Saudi Arabia, and ministers have threatened to “close” BAE production lines if the contract is refused. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz clarified in July this year that Germany will not deliver Eurofighter combat aircraft to Saudi Arabia soon.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The impact on the UK for losing this sale is going to be huge ....

(US Navy) \n\nJames: Struggles continue for US Navy to meet submarine-building requirements, commitments \nThe US Navy (USN) has continued to face difficulties in delivering Virginia-class attack submarines (SSNs), maintaining existing vessels, and gearing up for the construction and delivery schedule for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) meant to replace the Ohio-class boats for the US fleets. \nMeeting the requirements for the trinational Australian, UK, and US (AUKUS) agreement to bolster the Australian submarine fleet will likely mean a dip in the US submarine fleet below its future goals and needs, according to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: The Sinking Submarine Industrial Base (War On The Rocks)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Cost overruns are also becoming a problem ....

          "description": "Reuters: North Korea closes multiple embassies around the world\n\n \nNorth Korea is poised to close as many as a dozen embassies including in Spain, Hong Kong, and multiple countries in Africa, according to media reports and analysts, in a move that could see nearly 25 percent of Pyongyang's missions close worldwide. \nNorth Korea's recent closing of its diplomatic missions was a sign that the reclusive country is struggling to make money overseas because of international sanctions, South Korea's unification ministry said on Tuesday. \nOn Monday, North Korean state media outlet KCNA said the country's ambassadors paid \"farewell\" visits to Angolan and Ugandan leaders last week, and local media in both African countries reported the shutdown of the North's embassies there. \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Running an embassy or any other diplomatic office is not cheap.
