Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.\nRiver catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.\n\"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,\" Sullivan said.\nMore than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.\nA La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",

          "description": "“The problem is that Kim’s ideals aren’t wrong,” she said.  “But the way she does it is.”\nIn five and a half seasons, Kim’s long slide to perdition has become undoubtedly the narrative keystone of the series.  It has not always been so.  When it started, “Saul,” a prequel to “Breaking Bad,” seemed mostly focused on transforming slippery but fundamentally decent Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into Albuquerque’s sleaziest lawyer, Saul Goodman.  Kim’s ultimate role was then uncertain, even for the screenwriters.\n“We had no idea when we started how important his character was going to be,” said showrunner and co-creator Peter Gould.  “If you watch the pilot of the show, she probably has three lines of dialogue.”\nIt soon became clear, however, that the character of Seehorn, who started (outwardly) as a straight arrow with a promising legal career, would be an integral part of Jimmy’s makeover.  Like Jimmy, Kim was breaking badly.  Unlike Jimmy, however, Kim never appears in “Breaking Bad,” leading many fans to assume the worst.  The stakes were always potentially higher for her than for the guy with her name in the title.\nThat seems like a lot to bear, given that “Saul” is one of TV’s most critically acclaimed series.  But if so, Seehorn, 50, who has been performing on screens and on stages since the ’90s, handles it with grace.  Unlike the purse-lipped, inscrutable Kim, Seehorn isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, either professionally or, ultimately, in conversation.  She has no problem, for example, talking at length about a rash.  She’s funny and has a blinding, spontaneous smile that made me wonder if I’d ever seen Kim Wexler’s teeth (despite all those teeth-brushing scenes).\n\nSource Link",

Maybe it’s just that, as Thoreau observed, “one man can stand there and put all of America behind him.”  Perhaps – and this was certainly true for the first part of the 20th century – it was the remoteness and isolation of the place, the feeling that as the land stretches out towards the Atlantic, in one long, twisting branch, the current conventional world slips away, allowing you to rethink, reinvent, and get away with all sorts of things.  Perhaps some sort of pre-modern way of life – with so few conveniences and material comforts – attracted the urban cliques that gravitated to…",

He’s been hearing it at least since he was 12, the first year he started skating with NHL players in their off-season practices.  “I skated with them once that summer and I was that annoying little boy there,” he said.  “When I was 14 I skated with them regularly, almost every day they had ice.”\nSoon, Vancouver-based pros like Mathew Barzal of the New York Islanders and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins of Edmonton, the 2011 first overall pick, would be texting Bedard when rounding up players for practices and scrimmages.  Those sessions gave Bedard a sense of the skill and speed of NHL play, but the business side of the league, especially pre-draft interviews, stresses out a lot of talented teenagers.\nThus, Newport Sports Management, the agency representing Bedard, organized for its client interviews with three general managers of the NHL: Don Sweeney of the Boston Bruins, Kyle Davidson of the Chicago Blackhawks and Yzerman, now at the front office of the Red Wings. .\nFor Bedard, the most intense was a one-on-one interview with Yzerman.  “We talked for 45 minutes and he asked a lot of questions,” Bedard said.  “In the end it probably became more of a conversation than an interview. I asked him a few questions and he gave me advice on the game and the league.\n\nSource Link",
