I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at.\"\nThe White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were \"not true.\"\nMusk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.\nThe world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.\nHe also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.\nIan Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Nandita Bose in Washington and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Howard Goller)",
