That means we’re a city of 20,000 year-round residents.\nAnd half of the homes in Amherst are rentals, most of which are student rentals, many of which are overcrowded, overpriced and poorly maintained.  I recently received another call from a telemarketer, hoping to persuade me to sell my house to a certain investment company.\nChancellor compared Amherst to the college towns of Bloomington, Indiana (population 84,691), College Station, Texas (population 115,802) and St Paul/Minneapolis (population 730,413).\n    This is clearly a false equivalence.  We are the second smallest city in the nation to house a flagship state university.  That’s great for the city in many ways, but there are other repercussions that UMass shouldn’t sweep under the rug.\nI urge the leaders of city and university government to have the robust and urgent conversations needed to resolve the issue fairly and effectively.  It’s one of those “if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem” thing.\n    Ira Bryck\nAmherst\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {   var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];   if (d.getElementById(id)) return;   js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;   js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=833431040023870\";   fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nSource link",
