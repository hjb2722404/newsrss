          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r When it comes to shaping behaviors and fostering positive learning, the space in which students do their learning can have a profound impact on their learning outcomes. This philosophy was brought to life at a recent “Girls Go Tech” workshop co-hosted by The Women’s Foundation, an NGO dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls in Hong Kong, and Steelcase; an industry leader in creating great experiences in the Learning and Work Spaces through architecture, technology, furniture and design services.\r \r Launched in 2015, the “Girls Go Tech” (GGT) programme was put together by The Women’s Foundation to encourage female secondary school students from underprivileged backgrounds to pursue traditionally male-dominated STEM-related subjects. By connecting the students to various opportunities and stakeholders in the community, students are exposed to STEM subject matters and are given a hands-on opportunity to develop their self-confidence, problem solving skills, creativity and collaboration in order to help maximise their career options while achieving their academic and career goals. \r \r The most recent of these events was a visit hosted by Steelcase at their WorkLife space in Central, where students were invited to put their thinking caps on to conceptualize how to use technology and space to create a design learning space that offered better learning experiences. \r \r \r \r “Many of these girls lack confidence because they don’t have a chance at these experiences, so for some of our participants, this could be the first time they have even been to Central to go to a corporate partner’s office,” explained Connie Cheung, Programme Director for The Women’s Foundation. “This is a real eye-opening opportunity for them to visualize how technology is used in different industries.” \r \r Of course, when it comes to nurturing a design thinking approach amongst students, there is no better place to experience this than at Steelcase’s very own…",

          "description": "(Reuters) - Russia's Duma has indefinitely stopped broadcasting live plenary sessions to protect information from \"our enemy\", a leading lawmaker said on Tuesday as parliament's lower house debated topics related to the war in Ukraine.\n\"Those questions that require sensitive discussion in a narrow professional circle should not be the property of our enemy,\" Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the dominant United Russia faction, told the military news channel Zvezda TV.\nRussia uses the term \"special military operation\" to describe what Ukraine and its Western allies say is a war of imperial conquest. Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.\nThe move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday's session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.\nThey were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.\nAnother deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the \"special military operation\". He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.\n\"Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies,\" Svintsov said.\n(Reported by Filipp Lebedev; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)",

Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. \n“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”\nThe official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”\nThe FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. \n\"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”\n“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.” \nALSO IN THE NEWS: Marjorie Taylor Greene serves notice to Kevin McCarthy that he needs to hand her 'a lot of power' \nSee the full report at the Washington Post.",

          "description": "Fiona Hill, a former Trump adviser who also served as a key witness against him during his first impeachment trial, says she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has been using Tesla CEO Elon Musk to exert diplomatic pressure on Ukraine.\nIn an interview with Politico, Hill said that Musk -- who floated a widely panned \"peace plan\" between Russia and Ukraine and who also recently demanded that the American government start footing the bill for Ukraine's continued access to the Starlink satellite network -- is essentially being used as a conduit for Putin as he tries to end the conflict in Ukraine favorably on Russian terms.\n\"This is a classic Putin play,\" she said of Musk's recent attempts to interject himself as a \"peacemaker\" between Russia and Ukraine. \"Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin.\"\nHill also outlined the ways that Putin often uses Russian-friendly businesspeople to act as his intermediaries as a way to get around traditional communications channels.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Prosecutors unveil sexually explicit messages between Oath Keepers founder and his lawyer\n\"He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process,\" she explained. \"He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.\"\nRead the full interview here.",

N26 plans to roll out its crypto trading service to other key markets over the next 6 months. \nN26 customers with a verified identity can access N26 Crypto from the “Trading” section of the new “Finances” tab of their N26 app.  Thus, they can buy crypto from their fiat bank account.  Transaction fees are set at 1.5% for BTC and 2.5% for other currencies for regular accounts, with some additional discounts for N26 metal card holders. \nRelated: German crypto bank Nuri asks 500,000 users to withdraw funds before shutdown\nAccording to N26 co-founder and co-CEO Valentin Stalf, the company sees its new product as an entry point for a new generation of investors, who are interested in digital assets despite recent market turmoil: \n\n“While cryptocurrencies have seen a decline in value over the past year, they remain a demanded and attractive asset class for investors and a growing part of the financial system.”\n\nThe platform is run in partnership with Vienna-based Bitpanda GmbH, which handles trade execution and coin custody. \nIn November 2021, N26 announced its release of the American market and intends to focus exclusively on the European market.  However, the company has also encountered problems in Europe, with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) imposing the new customer cap on the company in May 2021. \n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Mohammad bin Salman and Vladimir Putin. AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko   \nThe Intercept: Saudis Sought Oil Production Cut So Deep It Surprised Even Russia  \nOPEC+ slashed oil production following a Saudi pressure campaign that experts say aims to hurt Democrats in the midterms. \nThe Saudi-led oil cartel OPEC+’s announcement earlier this month that it was cutting 2 million barrels of oil per day — a move that would drive up the price of oil just a month before midterm elections — rankled Democrats in Washington. They accused Riyadh of aligning itself with Russia, another powerful member of OPEC+, which would indeed profit off the move. “What Saudi Arabia did to help Putin continue to wage his despicable, vicious war against Ukraine will long be remembered by Americans,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. \nBut Saudi Arabia actually pushed to cut oil production twice as much as Russian President Vladimir Putin, surprising the Russians, two Saudi sources with knowledge of the negotiations told The Intercept, suggesting that Riyadh’s motives run deeper than what top Democrats want to admit. The sources requested anonymity, fearing reprisal by the Saudi government.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I agree with the above analysis that the Saudis want to hurt the Democrats in the midterms, and it looks like they will succeed. \nHere is a prediction. If the US Democrats lose control of the Senate and House, they will blame the Saudis. \nOn a side note. Expect even higher gas prices next month ....

Its attack drones can swarm to paralyze communications networks. China’s naval ships outnumber America’s, and it launched its third aircraft carrier this summer, the first to be designed and built in the country. Its defense budget is second only to the U.S.’s. China’s military has more serving members, at around 2 million, compared with just under 1.4 million in the U.S. \nThe question for Mr. Xi, which he has raised in public, is whether those forces are ready for battle. \nChina hasn’t fought a war since a brief border clash with Vietnam in 1979. Unlike American forces, who have fought for most of the past two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan, China’s service members have virtually no combat experience—which some Chinese leaders have referred to as a “peace disease.” Finding a solution short of actual war has been a priority for Mr. Xi, especially as he seeks to prepare the country for a potential showdown with the U.S.   \nRead more .... \n WNU Editor: I know my Chinese friends firmly believe that China's military capabilities now far exceed what the U.S. has in Asia.
