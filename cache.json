The Russian media was ordered not to use the word war - and has either complied or shut down. \nBut in response to what Russia said was a major Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow, Putin last week used the word \"war\" four times in relation to Ukraine, according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: On Day One of the invasion I called this a war.
