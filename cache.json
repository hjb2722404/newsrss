On the night of June 9 1942, SS guards attempted to completely obliterate the village by killing or deporting its inhabitants, by eliminating every trace of humanity and even by exhuming the dead.\n\nA total of 173 inhabitants were murdered on the spot. The rest were deported to the Nazi-operated extermination camps, where the village death toll rose to approximately 340. Those who survived suffered the fate of forced dispersal. \nBut an unlikely alliance of Staffordshire miners, a Stoke-on-Trent doctor and a town in Illinois were not prepared to let the memory of Lidice disappear.

          "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday compared his current actions to Peter the Great's conquest of the Baltic coast during his 18th-century war against Sweden.\nAfter visiting an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th birthday of tsar Peter the Great, Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs that \"you get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn't taking anything, he was taking it back\".\nWhen Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg and declared it the Russian capital \"none of the countries in Europe recognised this territory as belonging to Russia,\" Putin said.\n\"Everyone considered it to be part of Sweden. But from time immemorial, Slavs had lived there alongside Finno-Ugric peoples,\" the Russian leader added.\n\"It is our responsibility also to take back and strengthen,\" Putin said, in an apparent reference to Russia's offensive in Ukraine.\n\"Yes, there have been times in our country's history when we have been forced to retreat, but only to regain our strength and move forward,\" he said.\nThe defeat of Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700-1721) made Russia the leading power in the Baltic Sea and an important player in European affairs.\nBut with ties Russia's ties with the West currently shattered by the Ukraine invasion, Moscow authorities are downplaying Peter's affinity for Europe and focusing on his role in expanding Russian territories.\nMore than three centuries after he sought to bring Russia closer to Europe, Russians on Thursday marked the 350th birthday of tsar Peter the Great with the country deeply isolated over the Ukraine conflict.\nPeter I reigned first as tsar and then as emperor from 1682 until his death in 1725.\n© 2022 AFP",

          "description": "A libel lawsuit brought by Prince Harry against one of Britain's biggest newspaper groups had its first court date Thursday in the latest legal action taken by the US-based royal.\nThe Duke of Sussex is suing Associated Newspapers -- which publishes the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and MailOnline -- over an article alleging he had sought to keep a request for British police protection under wraps.\nThe lawsuit relates to coverage in the Mail on Sunday and online of a separate court challenge he is pursuing against the UK government over his security arrangements when he is in Britain.\nHarry, 37, and his wife Meghan Markle, 40, live in California after stepping down from royal duties in 2019, which caused them to lose their UK taxpayer-paid protection.\nThe prince's lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, told the High Court in a written submission that the February article was \"defamatory\" because it suggested Harry had \"lied\" and \"improperly and cynically\" tried to manipulate public opinion over the issue.\nAssociated Newspapers' legal team is disputing that there was \"any meaning defamatory\" of him in its coverage.\nIn the legal claim against the government, the duke has appealed to the High Court for a review of the interior ministry's refusal to allow him to pay for police protection himself, arguing the decision means he cannot return home safely.\nThe government has dismissed the offer to pay for police protection as \"irrelevant,\" writing to the court earlier this year that personal \"security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis\".\nThe cases come after the royal couple launched legal action in recent years against a number of publications, alleging invasion of privacy.\nMarkle won a long-running case against Associated Newspapers last year over the publication of a letter she wrote to her estranged father.\nJudge Matthew Nicklin, who is hearing the new libel claim, will rule on a number of preliminary issues that he is considering following Thursday's hearing.\n© 2022 AFP",

You cannot teach that!\"\nCab driver Neil Kramer also shared a photo with the prince selling the magazine.\nThe outing comes after Britain on Sunday concluded four days of celebrations honoring his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II's record-breaking 70 years on the throne.\nWilliam has long worked on homelessness issues and has been a patron of the Centrepoint charity, which works on the issue, since 2005.\nIn December 2009, he joined Centrepoint's CEO spending a night sleeping on the street to deepen his understanding of the challenges young homeless people face, the charity said.\nThe 39-year-old is the most popular royal behind the queen, with 66 percent favorability, according to YouGov, with the public warming to his low-key manner and charity work.\n© 2022 AFP",

For us, it left a bad taste in our mouths because what we hang our hats on is defensive effort and being a physical team.\nGolden State couldn’t match it, not long enough anyway.\nGolden State outscored Boston by 43 points in the third quarter of this series and took the lead in Game 3, 83-82, on a 3-pointer from Curry.  This basket had followed a rapid sequence of 7 points without Boston taking possession.  Curry was fouled shooting a 3-pointer, and since the foul was flagrant, Golden State recovered the ball and scored another 3.\nBut late in the quarter, Golden State’s grip on the game slipped.\n“Take the hits, keep fighting,” Williams said was the message in the group after the third quarter.  “Obviously they’re a great team that do runs, lots of runs, but just take the hit.”\nGolden State couldn’t get through the defense or stop the Celtics from getting a second chance.  Hustle games usually went to Boston.\nAt one point in the fourth quarter, several players got tangled up on a loose ball, and Smart found it before Draymond Green pushed it.  It was Green’s sixth foul, and the crowd laughed at him after spending the night shouting curses at him.\nGolden State’s Klay Thompson complained about fans swearing at “kids in the crowd.”\n“Really classy.

Since March, the Bank of Canada has raised its key rate by 175 basis points — the equivalent of 1.75% — in an effort to contain inflation.  “You see some households taking a bit of a step back because they have to reposition themselves in the market,” Mercer said.  “They may need to find a cheaper house, a different location, or time to save more on a down payment.”\nMr Powell added: “We are on a break – things have changed a lot over the last month.”\nThe real estate board reported 7,283 sales in the Greater Toronto Area in May, down 39% from May 2021 and 9% from the previous month.  The overall average selling price for all property types was C$1.21 million ($962,000), down about 7% from the previous two months.\nBoth trends suggest a more balanced market, which should allow “a bit more bargaining power for people still active in the market,” Mercer said.\nToronto’s major central neighborhoods, including Rosedale, Lawrence Park and Forest Hill, remain highly competitive as they suffer from a chronic shortage of available housing, said Cailey Heaps, President and CEO of the Heaps Estrin team.  According to the Real Estate Board, a detached house in the city currently averages just under C$2 million ($1.59 million), while a condo averages around C800,000 ($635,000). .\nAdditionally, the luxury market in general continues to perform “exceptionally well”, Ms. Heaps said.  “Buyers understand the scarcity of the product they are looking for.”\nIn Port Hope, the average selling price for the 38 homes sold in April and May was 909,000 Canadian ($723,000), up 28% from a year ago, according to Zolo, a classifieds site. real estate.\n\nSource Link",

Rob Walton was president of Walmart from 1992 to 2015. His cousin is Ann Walton, niece of Sam Walton and wife of E.  Stanley Kroenke, owner of the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, NBA’s Denver Nuggets, NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and Premier League’s Arsenal FC, among other teams.\nPenner is married to Rob Walton’s daughter, Carrie, and has been president of Walmart since 2015. \nWalton-Penner’s offer, if approved, would end nearly four decades of Bowlen family ownership.  The Broncos joined the AFL in 1960 and were dismal on the field for their first decade and a half, although they were popular with fans in the Rocky Mountain states.  But after Bowlen bought the club in 1984, the Broncos had 21 winning seasons, 13 division titles, nine conference championship berths and seven Super Bowl appearances.\nHis failing memory, Bowlen retired from team management in 2014, and left several administrators, including Ellis, to oversee the franchise.  The administrators were tasked with deciding which of his children should become the majority owner – or whether the franchise should be sold, if they thought it was in the best interests of the family.\nBeth Bowlen, Bowlen’s second daughter from his first marriage, worked at the club and was interested in becoming the main owner.  But she left the team several years ago.\nBrittany Bowlen, a daughter from Bowlen’s second marriage, was named as a potential replacement.  The seven Bowlen children could not come to an agreement on who should take charge, so the team was put up for auction.\nNow another family, this time with even richer pockets, is likely to take over.  \n\nSource Link",

          "description": "SAN DIEGO — They were hired to great fanfare during the offseason and received rave reviews in Major League Baseball for their early work with their new teams.  Both have won three Manager of the Year awards and, if things continue, they would also be strong contenders for this year’s vote.\nBut before they became dugout peers and quick friends, Mets manager Buck Showalter and his San Diego Padres counterpart Bob Melvin shared a moment together under different circumstances.  He arrived at Yankee Stadium in 1994, when Showalter, then 37, was a third-year manager guiding the Yankees under owner George Steinbrenner.  Melvin, who was 32 at the time, was an aging receiver in his final season.\n“Bobby saved my job,” Showalter said, explaining that he had three catchers on the roster at the time a…",

          "description": "ANAHEIM, Calif. — Joe Maddon has become the latest Angels coach to fail to deliver on team owner Arte Moreno’s vision of achieving glory with Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani.  He was fired Tuesday afternoon.\nThe move came after the Angels lost 12 straight games, a streak that reached 13 with a 6-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night.\nThe Angels went from a 24-14 record on May 16, when they tied for first place in the American League West with the Houston Astros, to a 27-30 mark and a 9.5 game deficit in the division.  With Tuesday’s loss in extra innings, Los Angeles set a franchise record for its longest single-season losing streak, surpassing a 12-game streak since 1988.\nPrior to the match, Phil Nevin, previously the team’s third baseman coach, had taken over as caretaker manager.\n\n…",

          "description": "The scrutiny is baffling for Ms Young, 33, who recalled how after the Parkland shooting she brought a leather belt to put in her classroom first aid kit in case she needed a tourniquet for a pupil.\n“It’s literally entrusted to their life,” she said, “but not entrusted with choosing the program.”\nTeachers in public schools earn an average of about $65,000 per year and were among the most trusted professionals, alongside nurses, doctors, soldiers and scientists.  But as schools closed and the social fabric frayed during the pandemic, trust in teachers has declined.\nFor some, the competing pressures were enough to drive them away.\n“I needed a change,” said Kathy Macken, 62, a math and science teacher in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas, who quit the classroom after 19 to do intensive tutoring with smaller groups of students.\nAfter being out of school earlier in the pandemic, her fifth graders returned this year in dire need.  Even when she tried to help them academically, Ms. Macken said, she spent much of her time trying to keep them calm and focused: Take out a pencil.  Write your homework in your diary.  Please no iPads during story time.\nShe had to cut back on a favorite science project — where students build terrariums to take home — because she didn’t have time.\nAnd in the last week of school, a lockdown interrupted an outdoor field day.  Amid the fierce struggle and bouncy house fun, the students were shoved inside.  Ms Macken huddled with her students on the floor of her dark classroom while police investigated a report of a teenager walking down the street with a gun.\n\n\nSource Link",

Drawing on a supply of roughly 7,000 US-made Javelins, Ukraine’s fighters have destroyed at least 400 Russian tanks and hundreds more armored vehicles. The weapon’s potency has helped foil President Vladimir Putin’s plans to overrun the country. There’s just one problem: The US stockpile is now running out. \nThe war has already consumed as much as one-third of the US military’s inventory of Javelins. Within months, the Pentagon will be unable to deliver new ones without emptying out its own supply. The war has also consumed one-quarter of the US inventory of Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles; Raytheon, which makes the Stinger, says it could take up to a year to restart production. (The Army has issued a $625 million contract to Raytheon to do so.) At the current usage rate, supplies could be nearly exhausted by next year.    \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: US to run out of Javelin missiles for Ukraine – Bloomberg (RT)   \nWNU Editor: It looks like the White House and Pentagon are going to have to make some hard decisions in the coming months.
