The new campus, though, will be a first of its kind and an important addition. \r \r It will represent the ethos, academic principles and 450-year-old tradition of excellence of Harrow School in the UK. But it will also be groundbreaking by offering an authentic Hong Kong curriculum leading to the DSE, with the option of the IB Diploma programme in the senior years.

Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing's sovereignty claims are void as the People's Republic of China has never governed the island.\nA Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.\nThe close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Additional reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)",

          "description": "On Thursday, The Globe and Mail reported that the Greater Vancouver Zoo is being sued after a toddler was attacked by bears into whose enclosure she had reached.\n\"The notice of civil claim filed in British Columbia Supreme Court by the girl’s guardian, Richard Hanson, says the August, 2019, incident left her with a fractured wrist, and one of her fingers was partially amputated,\" said the report. \"The lawsuit filed last month alleges the zoo and K-Bros Developments Corporation, which owns the property in Langley, B.C., owed a duty of care to the child, who was two years old at the time, given their control of the premises and the bears.\"\n\"It says the girl had reached through an 'unguarded chain link fence' at the zoo’s black bear exhibit and a 'group' of the animals 'attacked and mauled' her arm,\" said the report. \"BC Emergency Health Services issued a statement shortly after the incident, saying a patient had been airlifted from the zoo in serious condition. Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court.\"\nThe lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being \"vicious\", but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.\n\"The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide 'any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions' on the premises,\" said the report. \"It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl.\"\nZoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of \"petting or feeding\" the animals.",

But France’s nuclear sector has been going through a tricky time, as a significant proportion of its reactors have had to close for maintenance. Analysts blame a mixture of bad luck and the consequences of a political deal from a decade ago.\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Europe’s energy crisis and climate change racks the world, you could expect France to be congratulating itself on its vast fleet of nuclear power stations.

The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, spoke on Twitter of \"contemptible criminal behaviour\" by the perpetrators. \"I hope the police will investigate, find these guys and bring them to justice.\"\nThe desecrated graves included those of three Palestinian police officers and members of various Protestant congregations, according to media reports, including bishop Samuel Gobat, Jerusalem's second Protestant bishop.

While forward, operators frequently encounter lose / lose situations that the community isn't preparing them to solve.  This increases the risk of mission failure and damage to the reputation of the SOCOM community as a whole.  In part, the problem stems from the difficulty of the situations themselves, but the problem is aggravated by the community's treatment of ethics training as an individual task, when it isn’t.  Ethics training is a collective task, and it requires as much training as any other special operations skill set.  Grey Zone Ethics provides an accessible and realistic solution to this problem. \nDave Maxwell\nThu, 01/05/2023 - 6:34pm\n\nRead more about New Publication: Grey Zone Ethics: A Practitioners Guide to Making Ethically Difficult Decisions\nLog in or register to post comments",

(Jim Huylebroek/The New York Times)   \nNew York Times: Military Investigation Reveals How the U.S. Botched a Drone Strike in Kabul \nWASHINGTON — In the chaotic final days of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, U.S. military analysts observed a white Toyota Corolla stop at what they believed was an Islamic State compound. \nThe Americans were already on edge. Three days earlier, a suicide bomber had killed scores of Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at a main gate of the Kabul airport. Now, officials had intelligence that there would be another attack there, and that it would involve a white Corolla. \nThey tracked the car around Kabul for the next several hours. After it pulled into a gated courtyard near the airport, they authorized a drone strike. Hours later, U.S. officials announced they had successfully thwarted an attack.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Errant Kabul drone strike was 'deadly blunder,' US military misled public about children killed: report (FOX News)  \nUpdate #2: Pentagon misled public on drone strike that killed children – NYT (RT)   \nWNU Editor: Bottom line. A lot of wrong assumptions and biases were the reasons for this disastrous drone strike. \nIf I was to hazard a guess. The suicide bomber attack that killed 13 US soldiers at Kabul Airport a few days prior to this drone strike put everyone on edge, resulting in the mistakes and blunders that were then made.",

Pilot Scott Crossfield carried the aircraft to an altitude of 52,341 feet and reached a peak speed of Mach 2.11. \nThe flight kicked off a robust testing effort, and over the next nine years, three X-15 aircraft flew 199 times. The program eventually surpassed performance targets and achieved what is still the nation’s the fastest piloted hypersonic flight at Mach 6.72, or 4,520 miles per hour. Though it ended in 1968, discoveries from the program continue to inform the government’s hypersonic vehicle research.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Currently, Russia is the indisputable leader in the hypersonic weapons race and is gaining valuable operational experience with the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle and the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM), which is said to have a maximum speed of Mach 10 (link here).",
