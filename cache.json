          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r A tour de force of originality, innovation and wearability achieved through in-depth research, exceptional artisanship and application of cutting-edge technology, 30 graduating students showcased their unique creations, ranging from street fashion, evening wear, sportswear, knitwear, to intimate apparel, in a culmination of years of hard work under the guidance of SFT’s professors.\r \r The glittering fashion show also serves to reinforce SFT’s standing as a world-class education and research institution dedicated to comprehensive fashion and textile design training, leading-edge technological development in materials and production, as well as business innovations. It was organised by SFT and attracted a 1,400-strong live audience, including eminent figures in the fashion industry and fashionistas. The event was also live-streamed to over 40,000 online viewers around the world.\r \r Inaugural Dean of SFT, Professor Erin Cho, believes that the School is at the forefront of the newest developments in all fashion-related sectors, not just locally and regionally, but also globally. “We contribute to Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area (GBA) through our strong research capabilities.” \r \r “SFT is unique in the sense that we’re the leading and most specialised [fashion-related technology] research centre in the whole of China,” she added, citing that the School’s research capabilities range from sustainability, biodegradable and smart materials, to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and the metaverse, and all the other technological components.

          "description": "A US Army's 1st Infantry Division soldier trains on electronic-warfare equipment on September 6, 2019. US Army/Staff Sgt. Simon Mictizic\nInsider: The US Army is rushing to rearm its electronic warriors after watching Russia and Ukraine jam each other's drones \n* Electronic warfare has played a prominent role during the war in Ukraine. \n* Ukraine and Russia are both using EW to interfere with each other's operations and aid their own.\n* That has added urgency to the US Army's efforts to update its own EW weaponry. \nAfter years of neglecting electronic warfare, the US Army is rushing to revitalize its jamming capabilities. \nThe catalyst is the Ukraine war, where cheap but plentiful drones are playing a vital — almost decisive — role, doing everything from spotting for artillery to destroying armored vehicles. \nAt the same time, jamming has emerged as perhaps the most effective counter-drone weapon: Ukraine may be losing 10,000 drones a month — many to Russian electronic-warfare systems — while it strives to boost its jamming capabilities. Rather than using scarce and expensive antiaircraft missiles and guns to shoot down a drone that may cost only a few hundred dollars, it's easier to disrupt the link between the drone and its operator, causing it to crash.\n\n \nRead more .... \nUS Army Scrambles To Boost Electronic Warfare Readiness \n20 Years Behind, US Army To Up Its EW Capability As Russia Takes A Massive Lead In Electronic Warfare -- EurAsian Times\n \nUS Scrambles To Boost Electronic Warfare Readiness As Russia-Ukraine Drone Jamming Raises Concerns -- Benzinga \nUkraine war driving US Army electronic warfare development, Bush says -- C4ISRNET",

The state of Hawaii just found out this week with a blaze that engulfed the Island of Maui and killed at least 110 people.  A series of management blunders are being blamed for the deadly wildfire, but one incident in particular has frightening implications. \nWith wildfires ripping across West Maui on Aug. 8, a state water official delayed the release of water that landowners requested to help protect their property from damage and stop the spread. The water standoff played out over much of the day and the water didn’t come until too late.
