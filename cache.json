Michael Kappeler/dpa\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.\nUkraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.\nMelnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.\nRecently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.\nMelnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.\nThe Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of \"distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.\"\nMelnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. \"Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,\" Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations \"absurd.\"\nMelnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.\nSome German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.",

The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.\nSome have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages.

Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.\nRiver catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.\n\"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,\" Sullivan said.\nMore than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.\nA La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",

A helicopter from the HMS Montrose frigate spotted speedboats moving away from the Iranian coast on Jan. 28 and Feb. 25 and dozens of packages containing the advanced weaponry were confiscated, the Royal Navy said in a statement. \"The seized packages were returned to the UK for technical analysis which revealed that the shipment contained multiple rocket engine...",

          "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.\nEarlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com \"Love Actually,\" asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast \"Yakety Sax\" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy \"The Benny Hill Show\" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.\n \"Morning @snb19692,\" tweeted Grant. \"Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?\"\nLucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:\n\n\\u201cMorning @snb19692  Glad you have your speakers back.

          "description": "bitcoin (BTC) could see a massive price rally in the coming months, based on an indicator that marked bear market lows in 2015 and 2018.\nWhat is the Bitcoin Pi Cycle Lower Indicator? \nNicknamed “Bottom of Pi cycle“, the indicator includes a 471-day simple moving average (SMA) and a 150-period exponential moving average (EMA). In addition, the 471-day SMA is multiplied by 0.745; the result is opposite to predicting the bottom of the underlying market.\nNotably, each time the 150-period EMA fell below the 471-period SMA, it signaled the end of a Bitcoin bear market. \nFor example, in 2015, the crossover coincided with Bitcoin hits nearly $160 in January 2015, followed by an almost 12,000% bull run towards $20,000 in December 2017.\nBTC/USD weekly price chart with “pi cycle bottom” indicator.

          "description": "“The problem is that Kim’s ideals aren’t wrong,” she said.  “But the way she does it is.”\nIn five and a half seasons, Kim’s long slide to perdition has become undoubtedly the narrative keystone of the series.  It has not always been so.  When it started, “Saul,” a prequel to “Breaking Bad,” seemed mostly focused on transforming slippery but fundamentally decent Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into Albuquerque’s sleaziest lawyer, Saul Goodman.  Kim’s ultimate role was then uncertain, even for the screenwriters.\n“We had no idea when we started how important his character was going to be,” said showrunner and co-creator Peter Gould.  “If you watch the pilot of the show, she probably has three lines of dialogue.”\nIt soon became clear, however, that the character of Seehorn, who started (outwardly) as a straight arrow with a promising legal career, would be an integral part of Jimmy’s makeover.  Like Jimmy, Kim was breaking badly.  Unlike Jimmy, however, Kim never appears in “Breaking Bad,” leading many fans to assume the worst.  The stakes were always potentially higher for her than for the guy with her name in the title.\nThat seems like a lot to bear, given that “Saul” is one of TV’s most critically acclaimed series.  But if so, Seehorn, 50, who has been performing on screens and on stages since the ’90s, handles it with grace.  Unlike the purse-lipped, inscrutable Kim, Seehorn isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, either professionally or, ultimately, in conversation.  She has no problem, for example, talking at length about a rash.  She’s funny and has a blinding, spontaneous smile that made me wonder if I’d ever seen Kim Wexler’s teeth (despite all those teeth-brushing scenes).\n\nSource Link",

It seems like the German — and with it probably the European — economy is reaching that point. Most of Europe’s 100 largest companies were founded in the 1980s or before, which means that the old continent has entirely slept through the digital revolution of the 1990s and 2000s. There is no European counterpart to American corporations like Facebook, Amazon, E-Bay or China’s Alibaba or WeChat. \nThis became painfully clear during the Covid pandemic, when the once vaunted German bureaucracy was revealed to rely on paper, pens and fax machines in its health care system due to a complete lack of digitalisation in key areas. Not surprisingly, the German economy shows cracks elsewhere as well. Measured by market capitalisation, only one German company makes it into the top 100 worldwide, and German market capitalisation as a share of global market capitalisation has shrunk to 1.97%, an all-time low. These are devastating numbers for a country that just a few years back was seen as a model for the world with its transition to Green energy and the planned exodus from nuclear power.   \nRead more ....\nUpdate: Germany: Unprepared for a perfect storm (ING) \n Update #2: \"Social Peace Is In Great Danger\": Germany Is Quietly Shutting Down As Energy Crunch Paralyzes Economy (Zero Hedge)   \nWNU Editor: Germany's economic malaise/problems were present long before the Russia - Ukraine war. It is just that with the energy crisis not engulfing Europe because of Russian sanctions and other disastrous EU decisions, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the German and EU economies are now being exposed. The end result of this crisis is predictable. We will not only see the de-industrializing of Germany, but a lower standard of living for most if not all of Europe.",

Fears of recession on the continent abound, stoked by high inflation and energy supply uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \nThe European Union, which received roughly 40% of its gas through Russian pipelines before the war, is attempting to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas.

          "description": "Zero Hedge: Majority Of Europeans Unwilling To 'Pay The Price' To Defend 'Democracy' In Ukraine \nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, it didn’t take long for the international community to condemn the attack and react accordingly. Within a few days, Western powers imposed strict sanctions on Russia, hoping to cripple the country’s ailing economy and force Putin to retreat. More than four months and tens of thousands of casualties later, hopes of a quick resolution of the conflict have vanished, as a drawn-out war of attrition looks increasingly likely. \nHowever, as Statista's Felix Richter details below, while the sanctions against Russia have thus far failed to deplete Putin’s war chest, their impact is being felt around the world. The embargo of Russian fossil fuels has resulted in sky-high energy prices, while food prices have also surged as a result of the sanctions and Russia’s blockage of Ukrainian grain exports. As both Ukraine and Russia are among the world’s biggest exporters of wheat and other grains, the conflict is threatening food security across the globe, especially in poorer regions that rely on imports from both countries.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I am willing to bet that when winter arrives this European unwillingness to \"pay the price\" to defend \"democracy\" in Ukraine is only going to increase.",

But the reality is that managing the schedule of the oldest president in American history presents distinct challenges. And as Mr. Biden insists he plans to run for a second term, his age has increasingly become an uncomfortable issue for him, his team and his party.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: If his poll numbers were not this bad it would not even be an issue ....
