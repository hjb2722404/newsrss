This water mass blends distinct water masses along the equator due to ocean currents. The discovery, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, completes the understanding of fundamental water masses across the World Ocean. The Atlantic Equatorial Water was identified using data from the Argo program, which consists of self-submerging floats. This finding will enhance scientists' understanding of the ocean's mixing processes and global transport of heat, oxygen, and nutrients.",

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

No more big wars no more funding the military industrial complex!\"\nTrump's eldest son added that, \"For those of you who are idiots Ukraine lost this war quite some time ago we're just keeping them on life-support with never ending money!\"\nAs of now, the battle lines in Ukraine appear to have reached a relative stalemate, with neither side making substantial breakthroughs and Russia frozen with Crimea and portions of eastern Ukraine still under their control.\nALSO READ: Nazis bullied a conservative Tennessee town. Locals punched back. Trump should be worried.\nWith current U.S. funding for Ukraine running out, Congress is locked in an impasse over how to get a new package of Ukraine aid, coupled with aid to Israel in their fight against Hamas, approved in the Senate.\nRepublicans are demanding that the aid be paired with new border controls, including some that could reduce legal immigration. Democratic lawmakers have fiercely resisted this, although President Joe Biden has signaled he's open to a compromise on some of the issues.",

          "description": "A fellow actor filed a sexual assault complaint against Gérard Depardieu in September, prosecutors said Wednesday, adding to a string of allegations targeting the French star.\nHelene Darras said that Depardieu assaulted her while filming a movie in 2007, Paris prosecutors said, confirming a report from broadcaster France 2.\nInvestigators were studying the complaint, which likely falls under France's statute of limitations, to decide whether or not to launch a probe.\nDepardieu's lawyer Christian Saint-Palais could not immediately be reached for comment.\nDarras told France 2 that Depardieu groped her when she was aged 26 and appearing as an extra in the film \"Disco\".\nThe older man \"ran his hand over my thighs and my buttocks\" then \"said straight out: 'Do you want to come to my dressing room?',\" she added.\nDarras rejected the alleged advances, but \"that didn't change anything,\" she went on. \"He kept groping me between takes\".\nDepardieu was in 2020 charged in Paris after allegations of rapes and sexual assaults following a complaint by actor Charlotte Arnould.\nOther women have since accused Depardieu of sexual violence in the press.\nHe insisted that he is \"neither a rapist nor a predator\" in a letter to conservative newspaper Le Figaro in October.\n\"Never, but never have I abused a woman,\" Depardieu wrote, saying that he would not be getting involved in \"any projects\" given the \"context\" of the allegations.\n(AFP)",

The counteroffensive seems to have failed. The allies are weary.

          "description": "Thomas Peter / Reuters   \nMichael Schuman, The Atlantic: Why Xi Wants Trump to Win \nAfter four years of Joe Biden, China’s leaders would likely be relieved to have Donald Trump back in the White House. \nCompared with his predecessor, Biden has operated quietly. Trump launched a trade war; slapped tariffs on Chinese imports; and infuriated Beijing by referring to the coronavirus as “the Chinese Virus,” blaming the Chinese Communist Party for its spread, and even at times humoring theories that the party may have played a role in its creation. \nBut Biden has hit China harder than Trump ever did. Armed with a more determined foreign policy, he has inflicted acute damage on the country’s economy and geopolitical ambitions, from which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has struggled to recover. “A Biden-led U.S., probably from the Chinese perspective, looks like a more formidable challenge,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., told me.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Both Michael Schuman and The Atlantic are long time opponents of former President Trump while also being vocal supporters of President Biden. They do not disappoint in the above post. \nAs to what is my take. \nOne of the major cornerstones of U.S. foreign policy since Nixon's trip to China in 1973 was to go to great lengths to make sure that the Soviet Union (Russia) and China never formed a political/economic/military alliance. To do so would present a clear geopolitical threat to long term US strategic national interests. \nSighhhh ....\nFor the past 50 years this has been the policy. No more now. I can now say with confidence that the Biden administration has successfully blown-up this U.S. foreign policy priority. \nBottom line. \nA President Trump is not going to change this new political/international reality. And if Biden is re-elected, it will probably accelerate it even further. In both situations President Xi is the winner, and  Xi knows that.",
