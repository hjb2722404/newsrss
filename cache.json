To get your head around them, take the US as a comparison. There are around 45,000 psychiatrists for all 333 million Americans, which translates to about 135 psychiatrists for every million people.

Operations have been concentrated in the northern West Bank, where more and more young people are joining new armed groups. These groups are popular, have a strong social media following and refuse to accept any political affiliation. The city of Nablus finds itself at their epicentre.

          "description": "A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.\nThe comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.\nThe artefact provides \"direct evidence\" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.\nThe 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to \"May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard,\" the statement said.\n\"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel,\" Garfinkel noted, calling it \"a landmark in the history of the human ability to write\".\nLachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.\nArchaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first \"entire verbal sentence\" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.\nIt noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.\n© 2022 AFP",

The dark green stretcher that awaited him was one of several still covered in blood.  By around noon on Friday, doctors had counted 50 wounded, many of them soldiers. \nThe day before was even worse: 240 people had come through the hospital’s doors with everything from gunshot wounds to shrapnel injuries and concussions.  “They came in batches — 10, 10, five, 10,” said Parus, one of the Ukrainian medics at the hospital, as artillery screeched overhead and the chatter of machine-gun fire echoed off the surrounding buildings. “In the last couple of days the Russians have tried to advance more intensely.”   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Ukraine locked in trench warfare as Russian push for Bakhmut continues (NYPost)   \nUpdate #2: Fighting in east Ukraine descends into trench warfare as Russia seeks breakthrough (The Guardian)   \nWNU Editor: The battle for this Ukrainian city has now been ongoing for four months.
