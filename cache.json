(Foreign Minister) Yair Lapid have decided to submit a bill\" dissolving parliament \"next week\", the two leading Israeli coalition partners said in a statement. Lapid and Bennett were expected to issue statements at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)\nThey also said that if the bill is approved, Lapid will take over as premier of a caretaker government. \nShould that eventuate, it would be Lapid who would host US President Joe Biden during his scheduled visit to Israel next month.\nThe ideologically divided eight-party alliance was forged one year ago and includes religious nationalists, like Bennett, Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party, left-wingers and, for the first time in Israeli history, lawmakers from an Arab Islamist party.\nBut the coalition, cobbled together to end the tenure of divisive leader Benjamin Netanyahu, was under threat from its inception. It lost its majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament in April when a member of Bennett's Yamina party announced her departure.\nRecent divisions over the renewal of a measure that allows Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank to live under Israeli law caused fresh friction, with some left-wingers refusing to back it.\nThat was anathema to hawks in the alliance, notably Justice Minister Gideon Saar, who reject any notion that West Bank settlers live outside Israel.\nThe Netanyahu-led opposition had warned it would submit its own bill to dissolve parliament on Wednesday but Bennett and Lapid appear to have moved to pre-empt that opposition move.\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP and REUTERS)",

She said the conditions where he is now are very different from those people imagine in usual prisons. \"This is one of the most dangerous and famous high security prisons in Russia, known for torturing and murdering the inmates,\" she said.\n\"They fenced off a separate barrack in the area to really create a prison within the prison so that he can't speak publicly and isolate him from any information,\" she said, calling this \"purely psychological torture.\"\nNavalny, one of the most prominent critics of the Kremlin, was in quarantine after being transferred to penal colony 6 in Melekhovo near the city of Kovrov, he said last week on Instagram.\nThe camp has particularly harsh detention conditions and is located about 150 kilometres further away from the Pokrov penal colony, or some 260 kilometres north-east of Moscow.\nAt the time, his aide said she feared for his life. Navalny narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in August 2020, for which he blames Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNavalny has made many enemies with his revelations about corruption and abuse of power in the Russian state apparatus.\nIn May, a court confirmed Navalny's nine-year prison sentence for fraud.

According to police, both were shot with hunting ammunition.\nShock at their fate has echoed across Brazil and around the world, highlighting the overhaul of indigenous agency Funai under President Jair Bolsonaro, along with a rising tide of violence and criminal incursions on native lands.\nOn Sunday, police identified five more suspects for the murders.\n(Reporting by Steven Grattan; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

They said the coordinated action was intended to put pressure on the only G7 government that does not recognize gay unions.\n© 2022 AFP",

Until June, River Cruises Uniworld Store offers half-price fares on 20 European river itineraries, such as an eight-day Rhine cruise from Basel to Amsterdam from $2,999 pp in August, which includes an open bar and excursions, after the discount.\n“A sale of this caliber is not common for us, but we are constantly monitoring booking trends and listening to our customers,” Ellen Bettridge, president and CEO of Uniworld, wrote in an email.  “As a result, we are seeing shorter booking windows continue to increase for travel in the months ahead.”\nThe selection is narrow on some offers. AmaWaterways, another river specialist, sells select seven-night itineraries through December from $5,499, including round-trip airfare and airport transfers, which are normally extra;  the company says the inclusions are worth more than $2,000.

          "description": "If the Browns were looking to trade Watson, he would have to waive the no-trade clause in his contract and sign his new destination, as he did when he left Houston.  Either way, a deal would be difficult to strike, as many teams would be reluctant to accept his salary, and the majority of clubs have solidified their quarterback rooms in the draft and free agency.\nThe outright release of Watson without meaningful return seems unlikely due to Cleveland’s efforts to acquire him and because the Browns lack a long-term succession plan.\nThe team has excused its former starter, Baker Mayfield, from his offseason program as the front office seeks to trade him, and current replacement, journeyman Jacoby Brissett, is not considered a multi-year starter.  The best way forward for the Browns, said Bill Polian, the former Buffalo Bills and Indianapolis Colts general manager who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015, is to wait for the NFL’s final decision.\n“They have no choice,” Polian said.  “The facts are what they are.”\nAt an NFL meeting in Atlanta in May, commissioner Roger Goodell said the league’s personal conduct investigation was “nearing its conclusion” and the process would soon be turned over to a disciplinary officer.  The NFL can sanction Watson regardless of the outcome of the lawsuits against him if it believes he violated the league’s personal conduct policy.\nHow did Browns fans react?\nBrowns fans, deprived of the satisfaction of a championship since 1964, are unhappy, if not close to mutiny.\n“It’s just sickening,” said lifelong Browns fan Robyn Lockner, 51. \nLockner, who runs the Cleveland Browns Women’s Group on Facebook, said the allegations against Watson made it that much harder to be a Browns fan.  “You slap your female fan base in the face;  that’s kind of how I felt,” she said. \n\nSource Link",

Gleb Garanich / Reuters \nDmytro Kuleba, Foreign Affairs: How Ukraine Will Win  \nKyiv’s Theory of Victory \nAs Russia’s all-out war of aggression in Ukraine drags on for a fourth consecutive month, calls for dangerous deals are getting louder. As fatigue grows and attention wanders, more and more Kremlin-leaning commentators are proposing to sell out Ukraine for the sake of peace and economic stability in their own countries. Although they may pose as pacifists or realists, they are better understood as enablers of Russian imperialism and war crimes. \nIt is only natural that people and governments lose interest in conflicts as they drag on. It’s a process that has played out many times throughout history. The world stopped paying attention to the war in Libya after former leader Muammar al-Qaddafi was toppled from power, in 2011. It disengaged from Syria, Yemen, and other ongoing conflicts that once generated front-page news. And as I know well, the rest of the world lost interest in Ukraine after 2015, even as we continued to fight Russian forces for control over the eastern part of the country.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This plan is based on the hope that the West will overwhelmingly support Ukraine in the war.",

REUTERS/Gleb Garanich   \nMoon of Alabama: Ukraine - The West's Response As It Meets With Reality \nThis morning I watched an hour long discussion (vid) by 'experts' at the Center for Strategic & International Studies about assessing Russia's war in Ukraine. I have to say that these folks know nothing that is relevant. They seem to have never heard of Sun Tsu's dictum 'Know your enemy': \n Sun Tzu says, “To know your enemy, you must become your enemy,” but how do you become your enemy? You need to put yourself in the place of your enemy so you can predict his actions.\nNot once did the CSIS people consider the view of Russia or its real intent. They talk about this or that U.S. option but do not even once consider how the other side would react to it. \nOne of the CSIS 'experts' says that Russia had planned to take Kiev but failed. Take Kiev with what? There were some 20-30.000 Russian soldiers near Kiev which has some 3 million inhabitants. Historically one needs one soldier for every 40 civilians to occupy a city or country after the fighting is mostly over. Russia would have needed more than two and a half times the number of troops it had around Kiev to take and hold the city. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Another good review from the Moon of Alabama on the Russia - Ukraine war that you will not get from any Western news outlet.",
