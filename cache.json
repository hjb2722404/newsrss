          "description": "We host a roundtable on the life and legacy of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, who died Thursday at the age of 96. She was the country’s longest-reigning monarch, serving for 70 years and presiding over the end of the British Empire. Her death set off a period of national mourning in the U.K. and has thrown the future of the monarchy into doubt. “The monarchy really has come to represent deep and profound and grave inequality,” says Cambridge scholar Priya Gopal, author of “Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent.” We also speak with Harvard historian Maya Jasanoff, Novara Media editor Ash Sarkar and Pedro Welch, former chair of the Barbados Reparations Task Force, who says the British monarchy’s brutal record in the Caribbean and other parts of the world must be addres…",

Although the actions of the ex-president are problematic, they are not surprising.  However, shouldn’t the bigger story, and the outrage, be how these documents were able to leave the White House in the first place?\nIn most workplaces, when a disgruntled employee is fired, they are told to collect their belongings under the supervision of a security guard and then escort them out of the building.  The ex-president was ousted by the American people in November 2020, and he was clearly unhappy, denying the election results and promoting plans to prevent the peaceful transition of power.  So how is it that as a private citizen, the ex-president left the White House with boxes of documents belonging to the American people?  What systems or people did we have in place to prevent this from happening?  How have these systems/people let us down?\nInvestigations are underway to assess the impact of the actions of the former president on national security.  However, some impacts are already known.  Our allies will think twice about sharing information with us now that they know we cannot keep confidential documents secure.  Significant damage has been done regardless of what the recently recovered boxes contain.\nI’m not a fan of the former president and I understand the political motivation of the left wing media to focus on the culpability of the former president, but we can’t ignore the national security failure that has happened. product.  This should be the main story.\nRick Bryant\nAmherst\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {   var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];   if (d.getElementById(id)) return;   js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;   js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=833431040023870\";   fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nSource link",

The lawsuit accused Democrats and others of “conspiracy” to link Trump to Russia during and after the 2016 presidential campaign.\n“Basically, the problem with [Trump’s] the complaint is that [Trump] does not attempt to seek compensation for legal harm,” wrote Middlebrooks, who serves the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nAlina Habba, a lawyer for Trump, said…",

          "description": "Major League Baseball adopted its first field clock, limits on defensive changes and bigger bases for the upcoming season in an effort to shorten games and increase offense in a traditional sport.\nThe decision on time and shift restrictions by the sport’s 11-man competition committee was made on Friday due to unanimous opposition from the panel’s players, who approved the larger bases.  The changes had long been pushed by baseball commissioner Rob Manfred in an effort to combat the increase in dead time over four decades and the suffocation of offense in the age of analysis.\n“Over the past few years’ extensive testing, minor league folks and a wide range of fans – from the most loyal to casual observers – have recognized the collective impact of these changes in making the game even better…",

When I arrived, it was just before the platinum jubilee, and I was amazed at the number of people on the street who simply adored her.  And there was a lot of respect.  But there were many, many Americans there,” Hartley said. \n\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Queen ordered the Star Spangled Banner to be thrown outside Buckingham Palace as a way of showing solidarity with Americans.\nQueen Elizabeth II brought together 13 US presidents in office.  She met a US president in 1951 when she traveled to the US and met then-President Harry Truman. \nSince then, she has ridden horses with then-President Ronald Reagan, watched a Baltimore baseball game with former President George HW Bush and danced with former President Gerald Ford.  \nThe first time President Biden met the Queen was as a US Senator in 1982.  \nThe last time I saw her was in Windsor Castle    last year, after the Queen welcomed him and First Lady Jill Biden for tea.\nBiden and the First Lady visited the British Embassy in Washington to sign a book of condolences to the Queen.  He commented on her death at a fundraiser. \n“I had the opportunity to get to know her before she passed away and she was an incredibly decent and gracious woman, and the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth in their grief,” Biden said.  \nThe president said he is likely to attend his next funeral.  All flags at US federal and military installations were ordered to fly with half staff in honor of the Queen. \n    \n\n              \n          Most\n          \n            \n  \nSource Link",

The Sun and our readers loved you. We are proud that you were our queen,” he added. \nThe Daily Express carried the headline ‘Our beloved Queen is dead’, while the Daily Mirror simply wrote ‘Thank you’.\n“Our hearts are broken,” said the Daily Mail headline.  “How do we find the words? Our grief is a hundred different emotions, all difficult to grasp,” her homepage said. \n“As God Save the Queen played on radio and television, as we learned that our beloved monarch had died, a nation’s heart broke,” he added.\nUnsurprisingly, the story filled the inside pages of souvenir edition newspapers, most devoting at least 20 pages to seismic events.\n\nSource Link",

Photograph: Terravivos/Observer Design \nThe Guardian: The super-rich ‘preppers’ planning to save themselves from the apocalypse  \nTech billionaires are buying up luxurious bunkers and hiring military security to survive a societal collapse they helped create, but like everything they do, it has unintended consequences \nAs a humanist who writes about the impact of digital technology on our lives, I am often mistaken for a futurist. The people most interested in hiring me for my opinions about technology are usually less concerned with building tools that help people live better lives in the present than they are in identifying the Next Big Thing through which to dominate them in the future. I don’t usually respond to their inquiries. Why help these guys ruin what’s left of the internet, much less civilisation? \nStill, sometimes a combination of morbid curiosity and cold hard cash is enough to get me on a stage in front of the tech elite, where I try to talk some sense into them about how their businesses are affecting our lives out here in the real world. That’s how I found myself accepting an invitation to address a group mysteriously described as “ultra-wealthy stakeholders”, out in the middle of the desert.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The super-rich preparing for the end of the world is nothing new.

Still eager for adventure, after army service, Rescorla enlisted in the Northern Rhodesia Police.\nUltimately finding few prospects for advancement in Britain or her few remaining colonies, Rescorla moved to the United States, and joined the US Army in 1963.

Much of Ukraine’s territorial gains were confirmed by Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday. \n“[It] was a big special disinformation operation,” said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraine’s special forces.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: If these Ukrainian reports are true it is no solace to the thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed and wounded in the Kherson offensive whose territorial gains were minimal at best ....

          "description": "WNU Editor: This is what happens when a front line collapses. And while I am sure that Ukraine has lost a lot of soldiers in their Kharkiv counter-attack, they have gained significant territory and they now have the military momentum in this part of the war. \nReaction to this defeat on Russian social media has been predictable and quite a sight to see today. Criticism of President Putin and the Generals who are responsible for the war have been widespread and brutal. I am sure Putin is now feeling the pressure to change his military strategy from a \"special operation\" to something that is more significant. \n\nThe next few days are going to be critical. The Russian Ministry of Defense clearly underestimated this Ukraine counter-offensive, and they are now deploying heavy reinforcements to blunt it. But this takes time, and for now Ukraine will take advantage of their momentum. \nThe big surprise (for me) in this counter-offensive are the actual low number of soldiers that are involved (for now). At the beginning of the Kharkiv counter-offensive Ukraine deployed anywhere from 9,000 - 15,000 soldiers. And on the Russian side it was mostly Donbas militia numbering only a few thousand mixed with a few thousand regular Russian forces to face the Ukrainians. \nOn a thousand mile long front there are always going to be gaps and weaknesses, and in this case the Ukraine military saw an opportunity and they took it.  The big question that needs to be answered is .... can Ukraine keep this territory that they have recaptured? \nI say this because a few months ago Ukraine launched a counter-offensive to the north of Kharkiv and they were very successful. Even reaching the border of Russia, albeit briefly. But within a few weeks they were driven back to their original positions, experiencing heavy casualties. \nWill history repeat itself? We shall see.",

At 45, Meloni, who started her political career in Italy’s post-fascist party, is a political veteran but has almost no government experience. \nAs the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, she has vowed to maintain the course set by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi on support for Ukraine and fiscal discipline.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Italians want real change and a stable government. \nPolls Indicate A Crushing Win For Italy;s Conservative Coalition When Polls Open On September 25   \nItaly's right heads for clear election victory, final polls indicate -- Reuters \nItaly’s fractured left taps young feminist to lift campaign -- AP  \nWhat happens if right-wing Giorgia Meloni wins Italy’s elections? -- Brookings Institute  \nItaly election: who’s running, who will win, and why does it matter? -- The Guardian",
