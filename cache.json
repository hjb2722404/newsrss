Here’s the latest news.\n Thousands of people were killed after a pair of powerful earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria in the early morning hours of February 6. The first quake — a 7.8 magnitude temblor, equal to the strongest quake ever recorded in Turkey — was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake and scores of powerful aftershocks. \nThese earthquakes come on top of a more than 10-year civil war in Syria, which has destabilized the region for years. The country is still suffering from an ongoing — and chronically underfunded — humanitarian emergency. Millions are displaced within Syria or have fled to Turkey, which is contending with high inflation and a deepening economic crisis. The earthquake unleashed widespread damage and destruction in some of the most at-risk areas in the region.\nThousands are injured, and the death toll continues to rise as search-and-rescue operations continue in difficult, cold, and stormy conditions. Freezing weather is hampering some of the recovery efforts, as the window to find survivors gets narrower and narrower.\nThis is a developing story.

The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.\"\nThe asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Colin Kaepernick targets Kevin McCarthy's crime-ridden California district\nThe rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.\nBy comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.",

Chase Doak/via REUTERS   \nNew York Times: China Sends Spy Balloons Over Military Sites Worldwide, U.S. Officials Say \nWASHINGTON — American intelligence agencies have assessed that China’s spy balloon program is part of a global surveillance effort that is designed to collect information on the military capabilities of countries around the world, according to three American officials. \nThe balloon flights, some officials believe, are part of an effort by China to hone its ability to gather data about American military bases — in which it is most interested — as well as those of other nations in the event of a conflict or rising tensions. \nThe balloons have some advantages over the satellites that orbit the earth in regular patterns, U.S. officials say. They fly closer to earth and drift with wind patterns, which are not as predictable to militaries and intelligence agencies as the fixed orbits of satellites, and they can evade radar. They can also hover over areas while satellites are generally in constant motion. Simple cameras on balloons can produce clearer images than those on orbital satellites, and other surveillance equipment can pick up signals that do not reach the altitude of satellites.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The US continues to retrieve fragments from the Chinese balloon that was shot down on Sunday(see video below):",
