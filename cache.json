Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.\nHe also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.\nIan Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine.

Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.\n© 2022 AFP",

They were always talking to each other, and it was made easier not only because of business, but also due to family ties between Fujian province and Taiwan (they both face each other cross the Taiwan Strait).",

The German Army lacks certain basic personal equipment to fight a war, she shockingly noted during an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. “Without munitions, it’s all nothing,” Hoegl said. Furthermore, she called on the German administration to focus on replenishing the arms depots, particularly during the heightened security risks across the European region from the ongoing Russian offensive in Ukraine.    \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: German army has €20 billion ammo shortfall – top MP (RT)   \nWNU Editor: Germany has the wealth and industrial base to quickly build-up its military.

          "description": "The Daily Skeptic: Ukrainian Public Opinion on the War \nBecause casualty figures are so uncertain, it’s unclear whether the war in Ukraine qualifies as the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II. After all, approximately 130,000 people died in the Yugoslav wars. \nWhat is clear is that it’s the most intense conflict. Tens of thousands of people have died in just the eight months since Russia’s invasion began. If the conflict continues, it will soon surpass the Yugoslav wars in total casualties; and it may already have done so. \nOn top of all the deaths, Ukraine has seen a massive exodus of refugees, along with catastrophic damage to homes, industry and physical infrastructure. The cost of rebuilding the country has been estimated at several hundred billion dollars – similar to Ukraine’s entire GDP before the war (which may fall by more than a third this year).   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Denis Kireev was part of the Ukrainian delegation that met Russian negotiators at the beginning of the war. He was advocating compromise and finding a peaceful solution to end the conflict. When this became known by ultra-nationalists, he was labeled a Russian spy, accused of treason, and immediately executed (link here). \nDennis Kireev is not the only one to learn first hand on what happens if you want peace through negotiation. Since the start of the war I have heard of numerous stories and reports on what happens to those who want Ukraine to enter into peace negotiations with Russia. Let us just say that the authorities will not be kind to you.\n\nAnd that is why no one in Ukraine is going to publicly advocate for negotiations. And they are certainly not going to say so to a stranger who calls them on a phone.",
