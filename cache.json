          "description": "On an otherwise typical morning, one very important component of village life appeared to be missing. The proud parish of just 600, woke to find all the ‚ÄòEggs‚Äô in its namesake street signs and notice boards had mysteriously disappeared. The ‚ÄòWelcome to Egginton‚Äô signs bookending the village, now read ‚ÄòWelcome to ‚Ä¶Inton‚Äô leading to much head scratching from passers-by. As speculation grew, Egginton began to wonder who had hidden their eggs. In a cunning move, the unsuspecting residents were then given clues to a village location so Egginton could get its ‚ÄòEggs‚Äô back, as Cadbury revealed it was behind the amusing activity. The self-proclaimed ‚ÄòEaster obsessed‚Äô village, donned their Easter bonnet best and hopped at the chance to get involved in some early Easter fun. Within minutes, the entire parish (plus some curious local sheep and lambs) was gathered on mass, in search of its eggs. Egginton was led to a giant purple Cadbury Easter egg, peaking through the daffodils in a nearby open space. The generous collection was made up of hundreds of Cadbury Easter eggs ‚Äì one for everyone in the village to enjoy or hide for someone special this Easter.",

(Lynsey Addario/The New York Times)  ¬†\nNew York Times: From Rockets to Ball Bearings, Pentagon Struggles to Feed War Machine¬†\nWASHINGTON ‚Äî The Navy admiral had a blunt message for the military contractors building precision-guided missiles for his warships, submarines and planes at a moment when the United States is dispatching arms to Ukraine and preparing for the possibility of conflict with China.¬†\n‚ÄúLook at me. I am not forgiving the fact you‚Äôre not delivering the ordnance we need. OK?‚Äù Adm. Daryl Caudle, who is in charge of delivering weapons to most of the Navy‚Äôs East Coast-based fleet, warned contractors during an industry gathering in January. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about war-fighting, national security, and going against a competitor here and a potential adversary that is like nothing we‚Äôve ever seen. And we can‚Äôt dillydally around with these deliveries.‚Äù¬†\nHis open frustration reflects a problem that has become worryingly apparent as the Pentagon dispatches its own stocks of weapons to help Ukraine hold off Russia and Washington warily watches for signs that China might provoke a new conflict by invading Taiwan: The United States lacks the capacity to produce the arms that the nation and its allies need at a time of heightened superpower tensions.  ¬†\nRead more ....   ¬†\nWNU Editor: If the US Department of Defense is having supply chain problems. You have to wonder where is all the money going, and more importantly, how is it being managed .... How the Pentagon's $842B budget is the largest in its history and still may be inadequate (FOX News).",
