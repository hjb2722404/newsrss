          "description": "China's hospitals have been struggling to keep up amid soaring coronavirus cases after the Chinese Communist Party abruptly reversed its stringent \"zero Covid\" policy while the country's vaccination rate remains low. FRANCE 24 correspondents Lou Kisiela, Antoine Morel, Yan Chen and Yena Lee report from a hospital in Shanghai.\n\nThis hospital is considered one of the best in China, but it is overwhelmed as Covid cases soar. Stretchers and oxygen tanks pile up in the lobby as ambulance after ambulance arrives, day and night. “I am very worried. I feel powerless. It’s very crowded,” said the daughter-in-law of an elderly patient whose condition was alarming. “The hospital is doing its best […] but they are understaffed. The doctors don’t have time to answer our questions.”\n\nMeanwhile, patients with less serious symptoms were waiting for rationed fever medication. Pharmacies have run out of stock, and this hospital can prescribe it at the rate of one dose per person, per day.\n\n“We could’ve stocked up on drugs before lifting all the restrictions. It’s the government’s fault,” said one patient. “Either we are strictly locked down.. or all the measures disappear at once!”",

The death of the UK’s Queen Elizabeth II spelled the end of an era, and a brave new protest movement emerged in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini. FRANCE 24 takes a look at the top news stories of 2022.'\nRussia invades Ukraine and war returns to Europe \nEarly in the morning on February 24, the Russian troops that for months have been building up along Ukraine’s northern fringes finally get the go-ahead to cross the border and stage a full-scale invasion.

As the BBC points out, Antov's death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov's friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have \"consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.\"\nAntov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. \nFrom the BBC: \"Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov's account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: 'It's extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.' The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a 'patriot of my country' and backed the war.\"\nRead the full report over at the BBC.",

The 2007 study, written by the Swedish Defense Research Agency, even posited a scenario: \n“One diver would be enough to set an explosive device.” \nToday, European investigators face almost exactly that scenario. The Swedish authorities leading a criminal investigation have concluded that a state actor was most likely responsible for a September blast that ripped through the gas pipes. Officials and experts say that explosives were probably dropped from ships or — just as the Swedish report warned — planted on the seafloor using submarines or divers.   \nRead more .... \n WNU Editor: I love the mental gymnastics that the New York Times goes through to try and blame Russia for destroying a pipeline that it spent 10 years to plan and $23 billion to build with the expectation of receiving almost a trillion in revenues over the course of its lifetime. \nBut we all know who was to gain (and is gaining) from this attack. \n\nAt least the Washington Post coverage of this story is more balanced and straight to the point ....
