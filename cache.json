Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.\n\"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller,\" said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.\nTheatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as \"art-therapy\", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.\nIevhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.\n\"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun',\" he said. \"There were tears.

          "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.\nRoizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.\nThe court declined prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.\nRoizman denies all the charges.\nOn Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words \"war\" and \"invasion\" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.\nRussia says it is conducting a \"special military operation\" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.\nState news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.\nRoizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.\n(Reporting by Reuters; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.\n\"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine,\" Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.\n\"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families.\"\nBrown said the human toll of the attack was \"just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine.\"\nShe cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.\n\"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Catherine Evans and Richard Chang)",

Many expect blockchain power consumption to drop precipitously, scalability to improve, and the network to be less vulnerable to attack.\nIt is unclear how crypto users might respond to a forked PoW token listed on Coinbase or any crypto exchange during Ethereum transitions.

The numbers were played up to gain access to more 'western' weapons. \nSince then Ukrainian officials have stated much lower totals of killed and wounded than make sense. \nThe lowball casualty numbers now are probably convenient to increase moral in Ukraine and to hide from its supporters the inevitable defeat that the Ukrainian army will experience. \nThis report must be seen in that light. \nRussia Hits Train Station in Deadly Attack on Ukraine’s Independence Day - New York Times   \nA Russian missile hit a train station in eastern Ukraine, killing at least 22 people, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday, in an attack that came as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day and brought home the harsh reality of the six-month-old war. \nThe attack, which took place in an area about 74 miles east of the city of Dnipro in Ukraine-controlled territory, was one of the deadliest strikes on the country’s railways since April, when more than 50 people were killed when a rocket slammed into a crowded railway platform in eastern Ukraine.  \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The Ukraine government may now be low-balling its casualty rates, but everyone I know in Ukraine do not believe these reported low numbers.",

Given how long it takes to build modern naval warships, the U.S. needs to start building now if it is to have the fleet it will need to deter Chinese aggression. \nLast year, Navy Adm. Phil Davidson, the former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, cautioned Congress that China is preparing to move against Taiwan by 2027. That assessment is shared by the current Indo-Pacific commander, the current CIA director, and Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state and ex-CIA director. \nWhy 2027? Eyeing negative economic and demographic trends, and the regional military balance, Chinese leaders worry that the odds they’ll be able to achieve their long-held goal of conquering Taiwan will fade with each passing year after that.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: I do not see the military balance shifting back to the U.S. after 2027.
