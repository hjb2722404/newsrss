Rowling in a new interview.\nRadcliffe was discussing the open letter he released in 2020, in which he criticized Rowling’s views on gender identity.\n“The reason I was felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because, particularly since finishing ‘Potter,’ I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter on that,\" Radcliffe told IndieWire.\n\"And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important,” he explained.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Trump Organization's criminal fraud trial put on hold\nIn his June 2020 open letter posted at The Trevor Project, Radcliffe wrote, \"Transgender women are women.\"\n\"Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I,\" Radcliffe explained.",

Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept,\" he continued. \"I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist.\"\n\"Surrender is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress... With a fair amount of fun along the way.\"\n© 2022 AFP",

CLEVELAND, DANIEL EGEL, RUSSELL HOWARD, DAVID MAXWELL, HY ROTHSTEIN, OPINION CONTRIBUTORS - 11/06/22 9:30 AM ET\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) may be facing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix a critical gap in its national security arsenal. Congress has authorized the creation of an institution dedicated to the study and research of irregular warfare (IW), and the education of officers and civilian professionals charged with defending against non-standard threats and executing competent IW campaigns and strategies. \nUnfortunately, initial indications are that this opportunity created by Congress — which comes at precisely the right moment to prepare the nation for competition in the 21st century, in which IW may play an oversized role — might not be realized.\nDave Maxwell\nSun, 11/06/2022 - 10:22am\n\nRead more about Defense Department needs to capitalize on historic opportunity (Irregular Warfare Center)\nLog in or register to post comments",

Officials swung into action, organizing a series of calls between Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and several of the country’s biggest oil refiners to discuss strategies to boost stockpiles. The tone was cordial, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. \nBut the very next working day, the oil industry was blindsided. At a hastily arranged press conference on Oct. 31, President Joe Biden castigated Big Oil for handing “outrageous” profits to shareholders and executives rather than bringing down prices at the pump. Unless that changed, he warned, oil companies faced more taxes. “Their profits are a windfall of war -- the windfall from the brutal conflict that’s ravaging Ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe,” he said.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: As I have mentioned before.
