          "description": "French journalist Laurent Richard founded Forbidden Stories in 2017 with a simple mission: to continue the work of journalists who have been assassinated or otherwise silenced. That same year, Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bomb. The organisation worked to continue her investigations and identify her killers, exposing corruption at the highest levels of the Maltese government. For Richard, the ultimate goal of Forbidden Stories is twofold: to bring crucial reporting to the world and to deter crimes against journalists by showing that \"it doesn't make sense to kill a reporter when there are 50 others ready to carry on their work\". He joined us for Perspective as we mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists.",

At this time we’re reviewing video and canvassing the area,” Kranenburg said.\nVideo circulating online apparently shows the events that led up to the shooting.

          "description": "Blue whales consume up to 10 million pieces of microplastic every day, research estimated Tuesday, suggesting that the omnipresent pollution poses a bigger danger to the world's largest animal than previously thought.\nThe tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood.\nNow a modeling study published in the journal Nature Communications has estimated how much is being ingested by whales.\nA US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements.\n\"It's basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale,\" said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study's first author.\n…",

Before the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow actively supported diplomatic efforts to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions. After the invasion, Russia initially disrupted these efforts, but soon reverted to a more neutral stance. Now, with Moscow becoming ever more dependent on Tehran for economic and battlefield support, Russia’s attitude will likely become increasingly unhelpful. This is bad news for U.S. efforts to restore the Iran nuclear deal and bad news for the cause of global nonproliferation more broadly.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Russia's focus is elsewhere.
