          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r Imagine applying to 25 of the world’s top universities and getting accepted into all of them. Jamie Beaton did exactly that and that isn’t even the most impressive thing about him. \r \r Beaton graduated from Harvard University in 2016 with a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree two years ahead of schedule. At just 20 years old, he became one of the youngest admits to Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB), arguably the world’s top MBA school. In 2022, he completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford on the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.\r \r But his success story is not just about impressive credentials — he uses his own experience to support other students to reach for the stars as he did. At just 17, Jamie co-founded Crimson Education, now the world's largest and most effective college admissions consulting firm which has supported over 20,000 students to gain offers to the most competitive universities. In Hong Kong alone, Crimson has helped more than 200 students to secure coveted offers from Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Princeton and so on.\r \r Beaton’s success didn’t happen overnight. His journey began in his teenage years, when he fearlessly charged ahead in his interests and academic pursuits.\r \r  \r \r The Making of a Prodigy: Jamie’s Teenage Years\r \r Beaton was no different from the average New Zealand teenager who loved playing video games and going to amusement parks. He had his secondary education at King's College, New Zealand, and planned to study medicine at his home university, the University of Auckland. Everything changed at 15 when he had a chat with a senior, who suggested that Beaton explore options outside Auckland. That’s when he started to shift his focus and set his sights on the Ivy League, Oxbridge, and other top international universities.\r \r Beaton took 10 A-Levels instead of the usual three. With a stellar academic and extracurricular profile, he received offers from all 25 top universities he applied to,…",

Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a \"bigger war\" in the future.\nThe man angrily shouted that he was \"done\" with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.\nAccording to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.\nREAD MORE: The View's audience bursts out laughing as Trump's words come back to haunt him\nThe issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.\nTraditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while \"America First\" Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.",

          "description": "By Kirsty Needham SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian nuclear submarines are key to defending the country's 36,000 kilometres of coastline and maintaining an edge against China, whose growing military presence means conflict can erupt without notice, defence officials and government advisers said. The shift from Australia's diesel-electric fleet to nuclear-powered subs brings additional range, stealth and strike capability - crucial capabilities given Canberra's reliance on sea cargo for trade, and undersea cables for telecommunications, they said. \"This is the biggest step forward in our military c...",

Araki and Weng had an unwritten agreement where Weng payed Araki $600 on a month-to-month basis. \nOn September 21, 2021, Araki allowed Weng’s friend, identified in the Hive's report as \"SJC,\" to stay in her rented bedroom. Weng then increased her rent payments from $600 to $700. Weng then took a trip to Taiwan, and SJC then signed a document post-dated May 24, allowing SJS to stay in Weng’s room to “safeguard her possessions.”\nIN OTHER NEWS: Backfire alert: GOP's anti-'wokeness' crusade could end up undermining their own candidates\nWhen Weng's return date was pushed back to 4 months later, Araki gave Weng until May 31 to move out -- even though Araki didn't initially signal any objections to the extended return date. \nAraki said Weng had “breached their contract by subleasing her room to SJC without his consent.” The court said that this contradicted Araki’s statement allowing SJC to move in.\n\"In the end, Araki was ordered to pay $40 to Weng for a partial rent refund and $130 in damages for $170,\" the Hive's report stated.",

The idea is to use an air-to-air missile with a nose that bends to get at the target before it can get away. The service views this as one path to giving current and future combat aircraft, including a sixth-generation stealth jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance program, a new way to engage increasingly maneuverable threats. \nThe Air Force Research Laboratory highlighted what is formally known as the Missile Utility Transformation via Articulated Nose Technology (MUTANT) project at this week's 2023 Air and Space Forces Association's Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado. AFRL says that MUTANT leverages work that has been done over the past six years on related technologies, but notes the core concept takes advantage of related research and experimentation dating back all the way to the 1950s.   \nRead more .... \nUpdate: US Air Force's New MUTANT Missile Can Bend Its Nose!

One is a detailed close-up of the B-21's nose and cockpit section, the other provides us with the first look at the planform of the secretive new jet, which aims to replace the B-2 and the B-1. \nThe elevated image underscores the B-21's overall layout, which harkens back to what the B-2 would have looked like if requirements for low-level penetration were not introduced mid-way through its development. This planform also would have given the B-2 a substantially higher operating ceiling, which the B-21 will likely achieve.
