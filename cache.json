          "description": "New York (AFP) - Stock markets had a mixed showing Thursday as European indices rallied while Wall Street slipped on concerns over interest rates. European Central Bank policymakers delivered another interest rate increase as anticipated, with eurozone consumer prices still rising fast.  But ECB chief Christine Lagarde sent dovish signals, leaving open the possibility of a pause in its streak of rate hikes as the eurozone's economic outlook has deteriorated. Frankfurt set a record close, while Paris and London logged gains as well. \"We've seen a strong session ... as investors increasingly ado...",

But this is nature, and it is a natural phenomenon that we do understand very little about.\"\nScientists do not fully understand why mass strandings occur, but pilot whales -- which can grow to more than six meters (20 feet) long -- are highly sociable, so they may follow pod-mates who stray into danger.",
