The French baguette has been added to UNESCO's list of cultural treasuresÂ known as 'intangible heritage'. The idea of the register is to protect traditions and skills,Â such asÂ Belgian beer culture or Neapolitan pizza, so they are not lost over time.

Many of these students were reeled in by recruiters who get a hefty sum from these institutions. However, once the students actually get to Northern Cyprus, their dreams crumble. Some are barred from even entering the country. And things arenât much better for those who do make it in, many of whom are surprised to learn that the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is not actually considered part of the EU.

Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing.

Natalia Gavrilita: First of all, the attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. These attacks have already caused two nationwide power cuts, one on November 15, 2022, and one a week ago. Today, we heard about new potential attacks, including ones targeting the nearby region of Odesa.\nI think that the greatest threats we face relate to energy security âÂ among other things â because of the supply line via Ukraine as we don't have any high-voltage transmission lines that can be connected to the Romanian grid. We are working on this and hope to have a joint high-voltage transmission line in 2024. Until then, we remain very vulnerable.Â \nRead more ....

Ukraine is certainly not going to be able to pay-off the debt that it has accumulated since the start of the war, and it certainly does not have the resources to rebuild the country when the war is over.Â \nWhat is also ominous is that all of Ukraine's youth know this. Even if the war should end today, they have no desire to stay in a broken country that will take generations of hardship to pay-off its debts and rebuild the country.
