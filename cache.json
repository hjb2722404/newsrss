          "description": "By Maytaal Angel\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul showed no sign of abating on Saturday, despite its suspension by the embattled premier this week, as tens of thousands took to the streets to demand it be scrapped entirely.\nBeset by the domestic upheaval and expressions of concern and disapproval in Washington, Netanyahu on Monday paused the overhaul to allow negotiations on a compromise between his religious-nationalist coalition and opposition parties.\n\"We don’t believe anything that comes out of Bibi's (Netanyahu) mouth. We believe it’s just a political stunt aimed at stopping the protest,\" said Emanuel Keller, 30, at a protest outside the Israeli presidential residence hosting the talks.\nOne of the main points of contention is the ruling coalition's push for more power in appointing judges, including to the Supreme Court.\nCritics see the government's drive as a threat to the court's independence and an attempt at a legal coup. Proponents say it is seeking a less elitist, interventionist bench.\nNetanyahu, on trial on corruption charges he denies, says reforms are needed to balance the branches of government. His Likud party and political allies in the far-right have been calling on their political base to stage counter demonstrations.\nIsraeli media estimated more than 150,000 people attended anti-government protests nationwide on Saturday, the largest in commercial hub Tel Aviv.\n\"We're going to win because this is not something that we can live with. We cannot live in a state that is not democratic,\" said Limor Moyal, at the Tel Aviv demonstration.\n(Additional reporting by Natalie Thomas in Tel Aviv; Writing by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Mark Potter)",

          "description": "Sex workers in Amsterdam say they are being unfairly targeted by city plans to tame its red light district. Known as De Wallen, the city’s centuries-old district takes its nickname from the red neon lights that highlight the 300 windows where sex workers can offer their services. But the Dutch capital’s famed prostitution windows will now close earlier — and they could soon move to a different part of town. Amsterdam officials say a set of reforms designed to rebrand the city’s wild image will help reduce crime and nuisance behavior in the area, but opponents of the measure say the move will o...",

          "description": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Almost a third of Brazilians disapprove of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, putting the leftist leader at about the same level of unpopularity as his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro during the first three months of his presidency, a poll cited by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo showed on Saturday.\nLula, who took office in January after narrowly defeating Bolsonaro in an election last October, has the approval of 38% of Brazilians, with 29% disapproving of his performance, according to a Datafolha survey.\nBolsonaro, who served as president from 2019 to the end of 2022, never formally conceded defeat to Lula. On Jan. 8, barely a week after Lula began his third term as president, Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the federal capital Brasilia to protest the election result.\nAfter about three months in self-imposed exile in the United States, Bolsonaro returned to Brazil this week.\nDatafolha interviewed 2,028 people on Wednesday and Thursday in 126 cities. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus two percentage points.\n(Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Paul Simao)",

Reuters \nRFI: 'Petrodollar' at risk as TotalEnergies sells LNG to China in yuan \nChinese and French energy companies this week finalised the first-ever deal on liquified natural gas (LNG) in China settled in the renminbi yuan currency. The trade, involving 65,000 tons of LNG imported from the United Arab Emirates, marks a major step in Beijing's attempts to undermine the US dollar as universal \"petrodollar\" for gas and oil trade. \nYu Jin, the general manager of the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC,) which closed the deal with TotalEnergies, says global resource procurement based on the yuan could \"promote the globalisation of energy trading and build a more diversified ecology.\"\n\n \nRead more .... \nUpdate #1: China completes first yuan-settled LNG trade (Reuters) \nUpdate #2: Goodbye US Dollar: China, France Complete First LNG Transaction In Yuan (The Deep Dive) \nWNU Editor: I must confess that the speed at which the US dollar is being replaced as the global reserve currency is astounding.

As the Fed hiked interest rates, the value of those bonds dipped, but would have been repaid in time if not for the bank run.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Here we go again.
