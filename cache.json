          "description": "BELGRADE (Reuters) - Police clashed with right-wing protesters on Saturday as several thousand people joined an LGBTQ march in Serbia to mark the end of EuroPride week, an event staged in a different European city each year.\nPolice clashed with two right-wing groups trying to disrupt the march, Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said, adding that 10 police officers were slightly injured, five police cars damaged and 64 protesters arrested.\n\"I am very proud that we managed to avoid more serious incidents,\" Brnabic, who herself is Serbia's first gay prime minister, told reporters.\nFollowing protests by nationalists and religious groups, the government had banned the march last week. But faced with calls by European Union officials and human rights activists, it allowed a shortened route for the march.\nThose participating walked several hundred metres to the Tsmajdan stadium where a concert took place.\nThe United States' ambassador to Serbia, Christopher Hill, and the European parliament's special rapporteur for Serbia, Vladimir Bilcik, joined the march.\nPrevious Serbian governments have banned Pride parades, drawing criticism from human rights groups and others. Some Pride marches in the early 2000s met with fierce opposition and were marred by violence.\nBut recent Pride marches in Serbia have passed off peacefully, a change cited by EuroPride organisers as one reason Belgrade was chosen as this year's host. Copenhagen was the host in 2021.\nSerbia is a candidate to join the EU, but it must first meet demands to improve the rule of law and its record on human and minority rights.\n(Reporting by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Christina Fincher)",

Beer occupies cult status in Germany and especially in Bavaria, where Munich is located.\nGermans are among Europe's heaviest beer drinkers with an annual average consumption of 84 liters in 2021.\nOn Friday, the German Brewers' Federation DBB told the government of the numerous challenges it was facing due to the war in Ukraine, including skyrocketing energy prices and disruptions in the supply chain.\n\"The government must react...

The penalties for publishing in any networks are a strong blow to the revolutionary values that granted freedom to all journalists and all Tunisians,\" said Mahdi Jlassi, the journalists' union head.\nJlassi added that the new law was reminiscent of those used by the late autocratic president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to crack down on dissenting opponents.\nSince Tunisia's 2011 revolution, its media has become one of the most open of any Arab state, with even the state-owned news agency frequently reporting criticism of the authorities.\nActivists on social media sites criticised Saied's decree, describing it as an effort to destroy those hard-won freedoms. Others mocked it, saying they would only publish sports news or art on their social media accounts.\nSaied's critics accuse him of having launched a coup last summer when he seized executive authority, moving to one-man rule with a series of decrees that he enshrined in a constitution passed by a referendum in July.\nSaied has denied acting unlawfully and says his actions were needed to save Tunisia from years of stagnation and political paralysis.\n(Reporting by Tarek Amara; Writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

          "description": "A young Iranian woman, who was in a coma after being arrested by the Islamic republic's morality police, died on Friday, state media reported.\n\"Unfortunately, she died and her body was transferred to the medical examiner's office,\" state television reported.\nMahsa Amini, 22, was on a visit to Tehran with her family when she was detained by the specialist police unit that enforces the strict dress code obligatory for women since shortly after the Islamic revolution of 1979.\nIn a statement Thursday, Tehran police confirmed Amini had been detained with other women for \"instruction\" about the rules.\n\"She suddenly suffered a heart problem while in the company of others receiving guidance (and) was immediately taken to hospital with the cooperation of the emergency services,\" it said.\nEarlier, President Ebrahim Raisi ordered the interior minister to open an inquiry into the case.\nSeveral lawmakers said they would raise the case in parliament while the judiciary said it would form a special task force to investigate.\nAmini's death comes amid growing controversy both inside and outside Iran over the conduct of the morality police, known formally as the Gasht-e Ershad (Guidance Patrol).\nIn July, a video of a woman standing in front of one of the force's vans pleading for her daughter's release went viral on social media.\nThe veiled woman kept holding on to the van as it pulled off, only being thrown clear after it gathered speed.\nThe mandatory dress code, which applies to all nationalities and religions, not just Iranian Muslims, requires women to conceal their hair and neck with a headscarf.\nOver the decades, women have increasingly pushed back, particularly in the big cities, wearing their headscarves far back on their head to reveal their hair.",

The head of the national civil protection agency Fabrizio Curcio was heading to Ancona to assess the damage, while party chiefs campaigning for Italy's September 25 election expressed their solidarity.\nEnrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party said it would suspend campaigning in Marche \"in a sign of mourning\" and in order to allow its local activists to fully participate in efforts to help the flood-hit communities.\n(Reuters)",

Minister of Finance, Ivan Chebeskov, during a round table organized by the Russian International Chamber of Commerce in Moscow.  Interfax cited Chebeskov as saying:\n\n“It’s not entirely clear how this should be regulated, so we are giving companies the option with this invoice to pay with cryptocurrency, but in terms of what cryptocurrencies will be used, how to negotiate with counterparties , with which countries it will operate – all that is what we leave to the entre…",

          "description": "Should Big Tech pay for journalism?  With the news industry becoming more insolvent every day, the debate is becoming urgent.  It presents a laissez-faire argument proposing that punishing successful disruptors for media failures is unfair.  But society would be well advised to look at the bigger picture.\nThe economy is clear.  Last year, the newspaper industry reported only less than $10 billion in advertising about half of which were digital;  the digital portion is expected to rise slightly while print ads slump.\nGoogle, on the other hand, introduced more 200 billion dollars digital ad revenue.  Google and Facebook together account for nearly three-quarters of total digital advertising, double their share from five years ago.  If Twitter matures, that will also be a factor, as it certai…",

          "description": "This rare Wisconsin home has never changed hands – until now. \nA pastoral Mount Pleasant mansion built by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1954 has gone up for sale for the first time – and its broker has been inundated with calls. \n“I don’t expect it to last into the weekend,” said Re/Max Newport Elite’s Anthony Veranth Crain’s company in Chicago of the low-slung property, which hit the market on Saturday.  By Tuesday, he said, he had already scheduled a dozen screenings. \nThe six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home is asking $725,000 for the “rare opportunity to own a work by America’s most prominent architect.”  Buyers should expect to pay a bit above the list price, as Veranth warns that the home, while well-maintained over the years, needs roof repairs, among other updates.  Including those in the payment puts the figure between $900,000 and $1 million, he told Crain’s. \nBuilt by Wright for the family behind consumer chemicals company Johnson Wax, the 3-acre property is currently owned by a trust linked to the great-granddaughter of company founder Samuel Curtis Johnson.  This great-granddaughter, Karen Johnson Boyd, commissioned the house from Wright and lived there until her death in 2016. Her widower, Bill Boyd, died in 2020. \nMembers of the Johnson family were big fans of Wright and commissioned him at least two other properties: their headquarters and a vacation home. \nThe main house is 4,978 square feet and sits on a ravine bluff overlooking Wisconsin’s Root River.  It is located approximately 77 miles north of downtown Chicago. \n“The dramatic and expansive Great Hall cantilevered over the ravine, emphasizing the continuity between indoors and outdoors”, claims the list of the complex, “blending with nature and maximizing the views”.  All but one of the six bedrooms have an en-suite bathroom and a balcony overlooks the main living space.\n\nSource Link",
