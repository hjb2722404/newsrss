The news of the pardon has since been spreading rapidly across social media, providing a glimmer of hope in a country that has been ravaged by nine long years of war. According to our Observer, the decision to spare the man's life was due in large part to the intervention of his mother, who camped out at the grave of the victim to beg for forgiveness. This act of mercy is being hailed as a powerful source of inspiration and a symbol of the enduring resilience of the Yemeni people.",

It's a gesture of recognition from Egyptian authorities after French scientists saved the mummy of Ramses II from a devastating fungus in 1976. Our Culture Editor Eve Jackson went to check out the once-in-a-lifetime show, while Lyana Saleh of FRANCE 24's Arabic channel spoke with renowned Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass about the fight to repatriate Egypt's ancient artefacts.",

Like the rest of the country, many of its residents are suffering greatly from the nation's cost-of-living crisis but none more so than women and children. This as the number of food banks in the country now outnumber McDonald's outlets, with a fast-growing number of working women becoming regular customers seeking donated food.

Yet, such was the grip of National Socialism on German society that even in this remote place there was scarcely any aspect of Nazi rule or of the Second World War that did not touch its 4000-odd inhabitants one way or another. Their accounts, in turn shocking, revealing and moving, lead us to ask that all-important question – “what would I have done?”\nLike so many of their fellow citizens, Oberstdorfers—deeply Catholic and conservative by nature —were drawn to Hitler by his promise to implement strong government, to expunge the ignomin…",

          "description": "In a further attempt to rein in increasing numbers of women defying the compulsory dress code, Iranian authorities are installing cameras in public places and thoroughfares to identify and penalize unveiled women, the police announced on Saturday.\nAfter they have been identified, violators will receive “warning text messages as to the consequences”, police said in a statement.\nThe move is aimed at “preventing resistance against the hijab law,” said the statement, carried by the judiciary’s Mizan news agency and other state media, adding that such resistance tarnishes the country’s spiritual image and spreads insecurity.\nA growing number of Iranian women have been ditching their veils since the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in the custody of the morality police last September. Mahsa Amini had been detained for allegedly violating the hijab rule. Security forces violently put down the revolt.\nStill, risking arrest for defying the obligatory dress code, women are still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country. Videos of unveiled women resisting the morality police have flooded social media.\nSaturday's police statement called on owners of businesses to “seriously monitor the observance of societal norms with their diligent inspections”.\nUnder Iran's Islamic sharia law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes to disguise their figures. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest.\nDescribing the veil as \"one of the civilizational foundations of the Iranian nation\" and “one of the practical principles of the Islamic Republic,” an Interior Ministry statement said on March 30 that there would be no retreat on the issue.\nIt urged citizens to confront unveiled women. Such directives have in past decades emboldened hardliners to attack women. Last week a viral video showed a man throwing yoghurt at two unveiled women in a shop.\n(Reuters)",
