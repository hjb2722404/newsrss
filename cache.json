          "description": "French lawmakers gather to strike a deal on a contested immigration bill that toughens France's immigration laws. The bill aims to make it easier for migrants in labor-scarce sectors to obtain residency permits while also facilitating the expulsion of illegal migrants. President Emmanuel Macron, lacking a majority in parliament, has had to compromise on the bill's measures to gain support from the right. Despite disagreements within Macron's camp, there are indications of an agreement being reached during the special committee meeting.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Namely, the report claims Russia has continued its efforts to sow division in the U.S. using social issues. \nThe report writes that Russia “sought to denigrate the Dem Party…and undermine confidence in the election, most likely to undermine US support for Ukraine.” \nA key piece of Russia's plan was “blaming multiculturalism and ‘leftist ideals’ for ostensibly driving the U.S. into crisis.\" The report said it \"had elicited responses from US males who were more than 40 years old and interested in ‘rightwing conservatism.'\"\nALSO READ: Neo-Nazi leader says he's banned from U.S. military bases\n\"Russia's tactics before the midterms aimed to build on longstanding efforts to forge ideological inroads with U.S. constituencies that they believed were more sympathetic to Russia's emphasis on 'traditional values,' according to open-source information,\" the report continues. \nAt another point, Strzok points to an excerpt on Russian actors casting \"aspersions on the integrity of the midterm elections, including by claiming the voting software was vulnerable, Americans expected cheating to undermine the midterm elections, and Democrats were stealing the elections.”\nIt continues an ongoing effort by Vladimir Putin to undermine Western democracy as a flawed system.\nStrzok explained it's \"hard to overstate how critical the 2024 elections are to Russia — and Putin personally. Expect unprecedented interference across national races.\"\nSee the full thread here.",

It also, the AP notes, \"stresses that blessings should not be conferred at the same time as a civil union, using set rituals or even with the clothing and gestures that belong in a wedding.\"\nWhile this may be the first time the Catholic Church will bless same-sex unions in modern times, a 1994 book by a Yale professor detailed the Church had blessed same-sex unions for centuries.\nProfessor John Boswell's book, \"Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe,\" The LA Times reported that year, \"asserted that from the 8th to the 18th Centuries, the Catholic church sanctioned same-sex unions and offered ceremonies complete with prayers for the couple’s union, Holy Communion and rubrics directing the couple to kiss a book of the Gospel, the priest and one another.\"",
