The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Putin clearly expected a polite applause, but he received none. The ambassadors—some having been scolded—expected at least a hand shake, and they got none,\" Swedish economist Anders Åslund wrote on Twitter. \"Just shows that no need to maintain any embassies or ambassadors in Moscow.

          "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - There is no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl between China and Mexico, China's foreign ministry said on Thursday, responding to a letter from the Mexican president asking Beijing to help limit illicit flows of the deadly drug.\nChina has not been notified by Mexico about any seizure of fentanyl from China, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing.\n\"U.S. needs to face up to its own problems and take more substantive measures to strengthen regulation within its borders and reduce demand,\" Mao said, referring to drug abuse as a problem \"made in the U.S.\".\nMexico's president said on Tuesday he had written to Chinese president Xi Jinping, urging him to help control shipments of fentanyl as he fended off criticism in the U.S. that Mexico is not doing enough to stop trafficking of the synthetic opioid.\nFentanyl, widely used in hospitals during anaesthesia and for pain relief, has become a major black market narcotic in the United States. Mexican drug cartels have increasingly taken part in the illegal business.\nOverdoses of the opioid killed more than 100,000 people in the 2022 U.S. fiscal year, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended in the March 22 letter efforts to curb supply of the drug, while rounding on U.S. critics, some of whom want Washington to intervene militarily in Mexico.\nThe letter and China's response did not mention supplies of the precursor chemicals used to make the powerful sedative.\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says both finished fentanyl and precursors are transported from China to Mexico, the United State and Canada, often by international mail.\n(Reporting by Yew Lun Tian; Writing by Liz Lee; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel)",

          "description": "Marketwatch: Here’s what is really behind OPEC+ oil-production cuts, say energy analysts \nAn unexpected production cut announced on Sunday by OPEC+ oil producers complicates strained relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with investors seeing signs of geopolitical posturing in the decision. \nHowever, some market analysts contend the cuts were less about sending a message to Washington and more about stabilizing oil prices amid fears of recession, as well as protecting the supply and demand balances. \nSaudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday announced they would slash a further combined 1.16 million barrels per day of oil production from May until the end of 2023. Russia, stinging from price caps and embargoes on its energy products as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, said it would extend its 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut through year-end. Together OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, make up the group known as OPEC+.\n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: The US was caught completely off-guard by this OPEC+ decision to cut oil production. This is a surprise because China, India, and a few other big oil consumers were given a heads-up that this was going to happen. \nI see this as another indication on how strained U.S. - Saudi ties have become, and how furious the Saudis are with the Biden administration's determination to bring down the price of oil via through price caps and selling America's strategic oil reserve on the open markets. \nBottom line. \nExpect $100/barrel in the coming months, and a return to higher gas prices by this summer .... Gas prices will surge in coming weeks after OPEC cuts production, analysts say (FOX News).",

          "description": "The Hill: Zelensky makes first formal visit to Poland amid Russian invasion  \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday traveled to Poland, marking his first formal visit to Warsaw since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February. \n“A meeting of neighbors, a meeting of allies, a meeting of partners, a meeting of friends,” Zelensky said in a Telegram post, accompanied by a photo of the Ukrainian president shaking hands with Polish President Andrzej Duda. “For the sake of our nations. For their future.”\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: A lot of speculation floating around on this visit. My gut tells me that Zelensky traveled to Warsaw to engage in talks on the upcoming spring offensive, and Poland's growing role in the Russia - Ukraine war. Because of the sensitivity of these discussions, the decision was made to have face to face talks to avoid any possibility of Russia intercepting their communications. \nBut in this backdrop of these discussions, there are growing problems in the Polish - Ukraine relationship .... Zelenskyy’s Warsaw visit overshadowed by political blowup (Politico). \nUkraine President Zelensky In Poland For Talks On The War\n\n \nZelenskyy visit tightens bonds with Poland amid Russian war -- AP\n \n'Historic strength': Ukraine's Zelenskiy hails ties as Poland vows further support -- Reuters\n'You stood with us shoulder to shoulder': Zelensky visits key ally Poland -- CNN\n \nKey ally Poland pledges backing for Kyiv NATO bid -- France 24\n \nPoland calls for NATO to give Ukraine security guarantees as Zelensky makes first Warsaw visit during war -- Notes From Poland",
