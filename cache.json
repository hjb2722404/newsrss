Whitaker will present his film \"For the Sake of Peace\" in the French resort. It is about people who are working for peace in South Sudan.\nThe walls of shops and streets in Cannes are lined with film posters and a large \"Top Gun\" installation has been set up in front of the Grand Hôtel.\nA giant pilot helmet points to one of the most anticipated screenings at the festival.\nOn Wednesday, Tom Cruise is scheduled to present \"Top Gun: Maverick\" - the sequel to the cult film from 1986.\nThe official poster for the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, which was designed as a homage to The Truman Show, is seen on the facade of the Palais des Festivals.

While inspecting the building, the agents discovered the tunnel access point, dug right out of the cement floor.\n\"There is no more light at the end of this narco-tunnel,\" US Attorney Randy Grossman said in a the statement. \n\"We will take down every subterranean smuggling route we find to keep illicit drugs from reaching our streets and destroying our families and communities.\"\nCross-border tunnels are frequently used by traffickers who smuggle migrants lured by the \"American dream,\" or drugs, into the United States, the world's largest consumer of South American cocaine. \nAccording to US figures, more than 90 tunnels have been discovered in southern California alone since 1993, including another \"sophisticated\" underground passageway located in March 2020.",

They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.\nAbdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.\n\nHe told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.\nSix years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.\n\"Evil did not win,\" he said. \"You can't kill rock and roll.\"\n(REUTERS)",

Rooms bursting at the seams with clashing florals, colourful furniture and innumerable knick-knacks, this is what defines the new interiors trend cluttercore (or bricabracomania).\nSome say it’s a war between generation Z (born 1997-2012) and minimal millennials (born 1981-1996), symptomatic of bigger differences. Others say it’s a pandemic response, where our domestic prisons became cuddly cocoons, stimulating our senses, connecting us with other people and places. But what really lays behind the choice to clutter or cull?\nWhy do some people revel in collections of novelty eggcups? Or have so many framed pictures you can barely see the (ferociously busy) wallpaper? And why do those at the other end of the spectrum refuse to have even t…",

Most free throws, almost 80% of them, are successful.  So why bother boxing?\nAnd then there’s Miami’s PJ Tucker, a 6-foot-5, 245-pound wrecking ball who spent his career disguised as a power forward.  Consider Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night, as Heat teammate Gabe Vincent lined up for the second of two free throws.  Tucker took advantage of that window to throw most of his body weight into the midsection of Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics.\nIt was a bit much.  One of the referees advised Tucker to cool him down, which he didn’t like.  But that wasn’t going to stop Tucker from playing the only way he knew how to play – hard – …",

It provides up to $10,000 in burial funds for families who lose children under 17 to gun violence.\nIn the time of sky-high inflation, every governor is trying to find ways to help residents of their state.  Ron DeSantis is giving Florida residents a months-long tax holiday.  Gavin Newsom is giving out free abortions.  And JD Pritzker of Chicago is now subsidizing… funerals.\n“Collins pointed out that ‘firearm violence is a leading cause of death for children and teenagers in Illinois,” and among Black Illinoisans, the rate is disproportionately high.”\nAs homicides in Chicago show no sign of stopping, the demand for funerals is now bigger than the demand for baby formula.  Just like a war-torn country, Chicago has now introduced curfew.  It is safer for the kids to be on the streets of Ukraine or Afghanistan than take a walk in South Side of Chicago.\nWhile Lori Lightfoot fights racism by refusing interviews to white journalists, the city’s black population is getting exterminated by the black drug gangs.  Apparently, Lori believes Tucker Carlson is not only responsible for the Buffalo shooting but also for black gangs indiscriminately spraying bullets on the streets of Chicago.\nThis government only cares about murder that can be blamed on “white supremacy.”   When it comes to black people shooting each other they take a Whoopi approach:  “ya’ll go fight amongst yourselves!”\nInstead of saving lives by asking the President to pay attention, increasing police presence or moving the national guard in, the Chicago authorities decided to go the “compassionate” route of making it cheaper for parents to burry their children who fell victims to incompetent and criminal government.",

But this will not end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has expanded in scope and scale beyond the capabilities of the Russian military resources originally allocated. With no diplomatic off-ramp on the horizon, the war risks becoming a permanent state of conflict between Russia and Ukraine — with unknown consequences. \nAs the Ukraine conflict enters its third month, the Kremlin looks likely to achieve its major military objective of securing physical control over the eastern Donbas region. Peripheral territorial acquisition of the strategic southern city of Kherson, as well as a swath of territory connecting Crimea to the Donbas and the border of the Russian Federation, also looks likely.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I agree with Scott Ritter's assessment that Moscow will achieve its military goals in this war, but politically there is no roadmap to end the war. Especially now as the US and NATO continue to arm and train the Ukraine to continue the conflict.\n\nA few weeks into the war this blog predicted that the Russia - Ukraine conflict will continue into 2023. But it will end when Europe, deeply suffering from the economic impact of the conflict, will tell Kyiv to agree to Russia's terms and if not the EU will cut-off political and economic aid.
