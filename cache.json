The march coincides with Armistice Day, leading to concerns about potential clashes. Metal barriers will be placed around landmark memorials, and police will be able to arrest marchers attempting to gather there. Right-wing counter-protesters, including football hooligans, are also expected to be present. The event has caused a rift between the police and government, with calls to ban the march leading to accusations of political interference.",

The Palestinian official and an Egyptian medical source said the suspension was due to problems bringing medical evacuees to the Rafah border crossing from inside Gaza. Limited evacuations from Gaza to Egypt began on Nov. 1 and were paused twice in the past week due to bombardments that aid staff said hit or targeted medical convoys.",

          "description": "Israel has agreed to implement four-hour daily humanitarian pauses in its offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, according to the White House. President Joe Biden had urged Israel for a multi-day stoppage in the fighting to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. While a formal cease-fire is not currently possible, Biden requested a pause of at least three days for negotiations. Israel will also open a second corridor for civilians to flee the conflict areas.",

Olmert said Israel should offer to start negotiations on a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority immediately after conclusion of the war. He also claimed that no Arab country would agree to replace the Israeli army in Gaza after the war, which is why he advocates a NATO-led military presence that would usher in a transitional civilian administration before final talks over a Palestinian state. Olmert slammed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, saying he had failed his citizens and boosted Hamas while weakening the Palestinian Authority: \"He is in a nervous breakdown.\"",

Cohen snapped at the well-dressed middle-aged woman, wearing sunglasses and a beige trench coat and holding a tote bag, shows video obtained by The Post,\" the Post wrote. \"This is illegal. Turn it on yourself, freak. You should be in jail,” the woman shot back, according to the news report.\nThe woman appeared to be confused about who Cohen was, according to the Post's account.\n\"She also appeared to confuse him with hedge fund billionaire and Mets owner Steve Cohen,\" it reported. \"When Michael Cohen demanded the woman’s name, she said it was 'Steve Cohen and I should be back in jail because I’m a piece of s—t.'\"\nCohen himself had this to say about the encounter:\n\"When reached by The Post, Michael Cohen said he wanted to get the woman’s name and hold her accountable,\" according to the Post's report. \"While walking on Park Avenue at the corner of 61st street, I was shocked to see this racist, antisemitic curmudgeon tearing the face off the missing-child poster and laughing about it. There is no place for people like her in civilized society,” he said.\nRead it here.",

He also took numerous shots at the retired general named Mark Milley, who said he had to restrain the former president's worst impulses throughout his time in office.\nTrump mentioned Milley alongside secretary of defense James Mattis.\n\"You know Mattis. General Mattis. General Milley. Real beauties,\" Trump said on stage on Saturday.\n\"General Milley is the one who decided to take the soldiers out first,\" he added. \"General Milley is the one that said let's leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind because it's cheaper than taking it out. It's cheaper than putting a tank of nice, clean fuel in the airplane and flying it to Pakistan or flying it all the way home. It's cheaper to leave it there.\"\nHe claimed 700,000 rifles, 70,000 vehicles, and more were left behind after war.\nThe ex-president added, \"We have an unbelievable military.

Strickland,\" the Vatican said in a statement.\nIt said the bishop of Austin, Joe Vasquez, had been named as apostolic administrator of the diocese, but gave no further details.\nThe Vatican has not said what sparked the apostolic visitation this summer -- which Strickland himself made public -- or what conclusions were drawn.\nBut Strickland, appointed by former pope Benedict XVI in 2012, was one of the most prominent critics of Pope Francis.\nThe Argentine pope, 86, has sought to forge a more compassionate Church, open to different views.\nBut he has faced intense opposition from critics -- particularly in the United States -- who accused him of causing confusion and failing to uphold key Catholic beliefs.\nIn a message earlier this year on X, formerly Twitter, Strickland accused the pope of \"undermining the deposit of faith\".\nIn a blog posted on his website in September, the bishop addressed rumours that he was being encouraged by the Vatican to step down.\n\"I cannot resign as bishop of Tyler because that would be me abandoning the flock\" under his care, he wrote.\n\"I have also said that I will respect the authority of Pope Francis if he removes me from office as Bishop of Tyler,\" he wrote.\n\"I love Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church which He established. My only desire is to speak His Truth and live God's Will to the best of my ability,\" he wrote.\nThe diocese of Tyler on Saturday announced the Vatican's decision to dismiss the bishop on its website, saying: \"Our work as the Catholic Church in northeast Texas continues.\"\n© 2023 AFP",

Karhi published an open letter on Thursday expressing his “deep concern regarding recent reports about (the outlets’) employee’s alleged involvement in the tragic event in southern Israel” early last month when more than 1,400 were killed.

Dan Goldman (D-NY) is enraged by this, issuing a statement accusing the Republican chairman of abusing his power to harass the family of a terror victim.\n\"In the clearest sign yet of House Republicans' devious and distorted priorities, Chairman Comer has decided to subpoena a private American citizen whose 3-year-old niece is currently being held hostage in Gaza by the terrorist group Hamas,\" said Goldman. \"Despite no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, House Republicans are spending their time attacking the grieving family of a Hamas hostage rather than working to get that hostage released.\"\n\"Chairman Comer's behavior is disgusting,\" continued Goldman. \"In his soulless desperation to smear President Biden ahead of the 2024 election, he has stooped to an entirely new low of abandoning the American families of hostages in a pathetic attempt to score political points against President Biden. In this trying time at home and around the world, the American people cannot tolerate this wild goose chase anymore. It must stop immediately.\"\nComer has spent months trying to look for solid evidence that the president has been laundering bribes through his son's international business deals. No such evidence has yet emerged, and many of their hearings with Hunter Biden's business associates have if anything provided evidence of the opposite.\nThe investigation has been folded into a broader impeachment inquiry into the president, which as of now has not actually formulated a theory of charges against him.",
