He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.\nAuthorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.\nInitial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.\nBy Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.\n\"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening,\" one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.\n\"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification.\"\nEarly on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.\n(Reporting by Liz Lee, Bernard Orr and Ethan Wang; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Clarence Fernandez)",

(Photo credit: Voice of America via Wikimedia Commons.) \n\n \nNew York Times: 3 Nuclear Superpowers, Rather Than 2, Usher In a New Strategic Era \nWASHINGTON — On the Chinese coast, just 135 miles from Taiwan, Beijing is preparing to start a new reactor the Pentagon sees as delivering fuel for a vast expansion of China’s nuclear arsenal, potentially making it an atomic peer of the United States and Russia. The reactor, known as a fast breeder, excels at making plutonium, a top fuel of atom bombs. \nThe nuclear material for the reactor is being supplied by Russia, whose Rosatom nuclear giant has in the past few months completed the delivery of 25 tons of highly enriched uranium to get production started. That deal means that Russia and China are now cooperating on a project that will aid their own nuclear modernizations and, by the Pentagon’s estimates, produce arsenals whose combined size could dwarf that of the United States.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: China's nuclear weapons growth is having an impact on U.S. policy.

Now, a contract with Boeing issued on Taiwan’s behalf by the US Naval Air Systems Command marks a first for the mobile, land-launched version, according to Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council. Three other people familiar with the deal, including an industry official, confirmed the contract is for Taiwan. \nThe Pentagon announced the $1.7 billion contract with Boeing on April 7 but made no mention of Taiwan as the purchaser. The deal comes as US-China tensions are high, particularly over Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims as part of its territory.
