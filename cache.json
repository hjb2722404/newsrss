He has now been freed. \n\"Another exchange of prisoners,\" tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. \"We continue to return ours. 64 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, are going home. It was also possible to free a US citizen who helped our people - Murekez Suedi. The bodies of the 4 dead were also returned.\"\nHis brother said that Murekezi said in a call that he was being held in the Donetsk People’s Republic with two other American nationals. \nThe Post report explained that a prisoner swap in September included two U.S. veterans. The latest swap adds up to 1,456 prisoners that have been released by Russia since the start of their invasion. \n\"One prisoner of war told The Post he was beaten so badly that his ribs were broken and his kidneys were badly injured,\" the piece said. \nRead the full report at the Washington Post.",

As the Post points out, the prison was the focus of a report last year by the US Department of State which looked into possible human rights violations, including violence and abuse by staff.\n“Inmates removed human waste by bucket,” the government report noted. \n“Some inmates developed bedsores from lying on bare ground,” the report said, adding that conditions included “overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care.”\n“Sanitation was a general problem, and cells were infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” the report noted. \nBankman-Fried faces criminal charges in the United States, including securities fraud, campaign finance violations and money laundering, over the collapse of his FTX crypto exchange.\nRead the full report over at the New York Post.",

Russia has been bombing Ukrainian cities relentlessly with missiles and drones since early October seeking to destroy the country’s energy grid and leave citizens without urgent services in the frigid winter, including a heavy missile barrage on Friday. \nBut Monday’s strikes mark the first time Russia had sent such a large fleet of drones overnight — potentially a recognition by Russian commanders that their noisy, slow-flying Iranian drones are far easier to spot and shoot down during daylight. \nRead more .... \nRussia Attacks Kyiv And Other Cities Overnight With Swarms Of Suicide Drones   \nUkraine updates: Kyiv takes fire from drone attacks -- DW  \nNighttime drone attack hits Kyiv as Putin heads to Belarus -- AP  \nUkraine war: Overnight strikes hit Kyiv as Putin visits Belarus -- BBC \nRussian 'kamikaze' drones hit Kyiv, Putin arrives in ally Belarus -- Reuters  \nRussia strikes 'critical' facilities around Kyiv using Iranian-made drones, officials say -- ABC News Australia  \nRussian drones attack Kyiv, as Moscow takes another swipe at Ukraine’s power grid -- CNN  \nKyiv, Ukraine struck by wave of self-exploding drones in early morning attack -- FOX News  \nKyiv: Drones Shot Down Amid Russian Attack -- VOA",
