Although the iconic \"Ding Ding\" has a long history, the company is heavily focused on the future, allowing students to get a taste of professional engineering to create the next generation of tram cars. Senior HKUST engineering students and EdTEch and Gifted Education expert Joseph Lin lead the program, which offers high school students a scaled-down version of the HKUST foundation program for first-year engineering. Before embarking on critical Grade 11 and Grade 12 course selections, students experience life as engineers by using the design process and building on existing STEMinn knowledge to ideate and construct prototypes, develop alternatives, select a solution, and refine until the final presentation.

In my opinion, it is protecting the actual burial chamber of King Khufu.\"\nIn 2017, ScanPyramids announced the discovery of a passenger plane-sized cavity, the first major structure found inside the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.\n(AFP)",

Mass demonstrations took place after long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\"The allegations against our colleagues are linked to their human rights activity, the Viasna human rights centre's provision of help to the victims of politically motivated persecution,\" Viasna has said of the case.\nBialiatski was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last October for his work on human rights and democracy, sharing it with Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties.\nHe had been arrested in 2021 along with two co-workers from Viasna.\n(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Shounak Dasgupta)",
