According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2020) and the International Labour Organisation (2020), 47.66% of women aged above 15 worldwide are competing in the job market. Facing competition for social resources, people should resort to competence, a highly valued trait in this context. \r \r Unfortunately, women continuously experience marginalisation, while the benefits brought by physical attractiveness seem obvious especially for them. Competition may lead women to value their physical features over their inner qualities (including personalities, thoughts and feelings), a phenomenon known as self-objectification. Those who engage in self-objectification, perceive and treat themselves merely as objects to be evaluated based on looks. \r \r In addition, this effect could be more robust among women who believe they can achieve a sense of control over others, especially men, through their sexuality—the belief that sex is power. In other words, physical attractiveness is used as a tool or a “shortcut” for these women to gain an advantage over their competitors.\r \r To test whether competition, in either work settings or a broad form of resource fighting, would interact with the “sex is power” belief to result in self-objectification among women, Dr WANG Xijing, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences, worked with other researchers to confirm these predictions across five studies: competition or a sense of competition as a feature of the working environment (Study 1); a real state in one’s life (e.g. job hunting, Study 2) or a temporarily activated state via experiments (Studies 3-5); results in self-objectification among women who believe sex is power (Study 1); or enter such a mindset temporarily (Studies 2-5). In addition, such…",

Can they reflect political and social situations? If you believe that recipe books can only teach you how to cook, you may be underestimating some important sources that reflect our history.\r \r Numerous scholars have argued that recipe books can be regarded as a reflection of the history, culture, society and identity of a country or place. Research on recipe books for communal canteens is especially rare in the field of China’s history. Dr FAN Ka-wai, Associate Professor of CityU’s Department of Chinese and History, has conducted research to discuss three recipe books created for communal canteens published in 1959. He used recipe books as the historical material, supplemented with government documents, booklets published by local authorities, newspapers and memoirs, among others, to reveal the diet of the Chinese people during the Great Famine, thus broadening our understanding of the Chinese Communist Party leaders’ thoughts and how they exercised control in the countryside.\r \r In early 1958, China initiated the “Great Leap Forward” campaign. Although previous studies broadened our understanding of this campaign, there is still plenty of room for us to discover more valuable historical sources to provide a more comprehensive picture of this campaign and the ensuing famine. In 1958, the people’s communes were established as an administrative entity in rural China. One of the most important elements of the commune were the communal canteens, which were established to ensure that all the members within the commune obtained a fair share of economic growth while forbidding the preparation of food at home.\r \r By the end of October 1958, over 2.65 million communal canteens were established across the country, and 70-90% of villagers ate in communal dining halls. Since free meals were provided every day, it was difficult for the canteens to design and cook many different dishes…",

This is known as the uncertainty reduction process in interpersonal communication. In the contemporary media environment, what people publish about themselves on social network sites (SNSs) provides information seekers with plenty of knowledge about the person. Previous research, however, showed that the SNSs information did not help an information seeker reduce uncertainties or feel closer to a person as much as directly interacting with the person.\r \r To explain this, previous research proposed a distinction between interpersonal and personal knowledge. Personal knowledge refers to how a target person feels, thinks, and behaves in certain situations. Interpersonal knowledge, on the other hand, refers to how a target reacts to an information seeker in a unique fashion different from how the target responds to others. It is argued that interpersonal knowledge can only be gained from direct interactions and it is the kind of knowledge that ultimately makes up the essence of affinity and intimacy.\r \r To answer further inquiries about how the information one can find about a target online contributes to an information seeker’s personal and interpersonal certainties about the target, Dr Nancy DAI Yue, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Media and Communication, led a research project  to investigate how the information seeker’s interpersonal and personal certainties about a target person were influenced by (1) positive and negative information on SNSs about a target person, (2) the source of the information, and (3) an information seeker’s positivism bias in interpersonal interactions.

Online video-mediated communication has been further popularised by the COVID-19 pandemic which sees more recreational and educational content posted online to reach a global audience. Online video-sharing platforms provide a space for influencers or educators to interact with audiences from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, thus creating opportunities for intercultural communication through online videos. In particular, how cultural identities are conveyed through the multimodal affordances of online videos warrants further investigation.\r \r Multimodal resources play an important role in the creation of video-based materials. The multimodality of videos offers content creators an enlarged set of resources, in addition to the use of language, to make meaning, and to perform their cultural identities. The notion of interculturality emphasises the interconnectedness of different cultures and considers how participants use different resources available to them to perform their cultural identities.\r \r Dr Jenifer HO, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of English, investigated how a multilingual YouTube influencer and his co-presenter who have a transnational trajectory orchestrate their multilingual and multimodal repertoires to make aspects of their identities relevant or irrelevant in a strategic way, to perform their multiple cultural identities. \r \r The study found that interculturality is made visible in online videos through influencers’ performance of dynamic and flexible multilingual practices. Furthermore, medium affordances such as images, camera angle, video-editing effects and so on are also deployed to construct the influencers’ transnational cultural identities. \r \r The study has implications for influencers, educators and the general public who want to create video-based…",

Soledar is a salt-mining town near the city of Bakhmut, which has been the focus of a Russian assault aimed at capturing the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n\"The terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that part of our town of Soledar ... is some sort of a Russian possession,\" Zelenskiy said in a video address.\n\"But fighting continues. The Donetsk theatre of operations is holding.\"\nIn a separate statement on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the Russians were suffering heavy losses as they tried to take Soledar and cut off the supply routes for pro-Kyiv units.\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren and Ron PopeskiEditing by Bernadette Baum)",

          "description": "French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo doubled down on its ridicule of Iran's religious rulers on Tuesday, with fresh cartoons of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei despite protests from Iran and its allies.\n\"The mullahs aren't happy. The caricatures of their supreme leader... do not seem to have made them laugh,\" the paper's editor, known as \"Riss\", writes in the latest edition, which hits newsstands on Wednesday.\n\"Laughing at themselves has never been a strong point of tyrants,\" he added.\nThe paper was hit by a cyber attack after publishing cartoons of Khamenei in last week's special edition, which marked the anniversary of the 2015 attack on its Paris offices that left 12 dead.\n\"A digital attack doesn't leave anyone dead, but it sets the tone. The mullah's regime feels in such danger that it considers it vital to its existence to hack the website of a French newspaper,\" Riss wrote.\n\"It is an honour in one sense, but above all proves that they feel their power is very fragile.\"\nThere have been months of protests in Iran sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a woman arrested for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code.\nIran issued an official warning to France over the \"insulting and indecent\" cartoons in last week's Charlie Hebdo.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian movement in Lebanon, also condemned the cartoons, saying Khamenei was not just a ruler but \"a religious symbol for tens of millions of believers\".",

But as the above France 24 video report on the Battle of Bakhmut reveals, just one hospital alone receives 100 wounded Ukrainian soldiers a day (14:00 mark in the above video)!!!! \nThe Washington Post is also pushing the narrative that Bakhmut is not important. I disagree. Bahkmut is the gateway to the major cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk that are only 35km and 40km from Bahkmut. Bahkmut in Russian hands automatically begins the battle for Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the last two major cities in the Donbas that is in Ukrainian hands.",

Leah Millis/Reuters   \nCNN: How Ukraine became a testbed for Western weapons and battlefield innovation  \nLast fall, as Ukraine won back large swaths of territory in a series of counterattacks, it pounded Russian forces with American-made artillery and rockets. Guiding some of that artillery was a homemade targeting system that Ukraine developed on the battlefield. \nA piece of Ukrainian-made software has turned readily available tablet computers and smartphones into sophisticated targeting tools that are now used widely across the Ukrainian military. \nThe result is a mobile app that feeds satellite and other intelligence imagery into a real-time targeting algorithm that helps units near the front direct fire onto specific targets. And because it’s an app, not a piece of hardware, it’s easy to quickly update and upgrade, and available to a wide range of personnel. \nUS officials familiar with the tool say it has been highly effective at directing Ukrainian artillery fire onto Russian targets.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: There is a lot of truth to the saying \"never let a crisis go to waste\".

Gen. Sharon Nesmith, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, said the Eastern European conflict had in “the first instance” caused the army to reconsider how to address air defense, uncrewed systems, deep fires and intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance (ISTAR) capability gaps. \nDuring the three-hour-long Wednesday UK defense committee hearing — which provided the clearest glimpse yet into the war’s impact on UK land strategy — Nesmith told lawmakers that in an attempt to fix the problems, the service has already completed an “internal balance of investment” and continues to look for opportunities to accelerate procurement. \nBut the new approach could be troubled by “two realistic constraints,” Nesmith said: supply chain difficulties and industrial capacity. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Britain's \"Future Soldier Guide\" is here (link here).",
