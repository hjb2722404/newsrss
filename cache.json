Mitchell/Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nThe Conservative Party has picked its next leader. Now comes the hard part. \n After a week — or, really, months — of tumult, the United Kingdom will have a new prime minister: Rishi Sunak. \nWhen Sunak, the son of immigrants of Indian descent, officially becomes prime minister, in the next 24 hours, he will be Britain’s first prime minister of color. It’s a historic victory, and Conservatives are celebrating what they hope will be his steadying tenure in an incredibly difficult moment for Sunak’s party and country.

          "description": "As far back as 2015, there were rumors that Trump was having trouble with powerful women. He doesn’t like them. Women will be judged 1-10 on The Howard Stern Show. John Barron called a New York Post reporter to talk about who Trump was with. Trump doesn’t like powerful women who can confront him face-to-face. Nancy Pelosi can remove anyone, including Donald Trump. For that reason, she certainly knew that if she called him a chicken, she could greatly improve Trump’s chances of responding to a committee subpoena, no — more specifically, not “manly” enough. After all, “Alpha Male” is everything at MAGA.\nWhen asked if Trump would show up, she tried it out today on MSNBC’s Sunday show:\n“I don’t think he’s man enough to show up. I don’t think his lawyers would want him to show up because he has to testify under oath. But I don’t think he’s manly enough, – we’ll see if he’s manly enough Show up and the public can make a judgment.”\n“No one is above the law! If we believe that, then they should be judged on how he responds to this request.”\nproficient. She did not question whether Trump was “strong enough.” Typically, Trump is seen as a “strong” leader. This time, however, he was challenged by a woman. Again, he doesn’t like strong women. Challenging his masculinity was the unapologetic, strong woman who won her power in Washington for decades.\nWho can forget this photo?\n\nEveryone remembers this photo of Nancy Pelosi standing in front of Donald Trump, but not everyone remembers what she said during the shoot.\nAccording to Speaker Pelosi herself, she said:\n“With you, all roads lead to Putin.” pic.twitter.com/5aN1PBD1Br\n— Trump Taxes (@TrumpsTaxes) February 24, 2022\n\nIf there was any challenge enough to bother Trump to appear and show his “manliness,” this is probably it.\nShe is very nice.\n\n\nSource: Politicususa.com",
