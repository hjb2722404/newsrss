          "description": "From Bollywood-style dance to henna tattoo workshops, celebrations for Queen Elizabeth’s record-breaking 70-year reign in the northwestern English city of Preston had a multicultural flavour on Saturday. With a population of 140,000 and close to Manchester, Preston is home to a large community with South Asian ancestry, and this year combined its annual festival of subcontinental arts, culture, tradition and heritage with celebrations for the queen’s Platinum Jubilee. To mark the royal landmark, the Preston City Mela, a showcase for all things South Asian since 1997, broadened its scope to include culture from the 54 Commonwealth countries.  “Of course we live in this country and we do love our queen, but it’s nice to have our culture in the spotlight for a change, and all the Commonwealth cultures as well,” Hanifa, a Preston resident of Indonesian origin, told Agence France-Presse. “The atmosphere is so nice and to have all those influences, all these cultures, makes it even nicer,” said the 60-year-old, who was enjoying the day with friends. She said she watched on television as the royal celebrations got under way in central London on Thursday with the Trooping of the Colour military parade, and found it “moving” to see the queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family. Gulab Singh, organiser of the Preston mela, said this year’s curators had tried to align with the jubilee “as much as we can”. “With the Mela, it’s always South Asian art, but we’ve broadened it up to reflect the Commonwealth perspective,” he explained. “This year, we have a cake-cutting ceremony … Cake cutting is sooo British,” added fellow organiser Shreya Ghodke. The Commonwealth is a grouping of mainly former British colonies headed by the queen, who is also head of state in 14 of these countries or realms in addition to the UK. Australia, New Zealand hail Queen Elizabeth as republic question returns Sitting in the sun, 58-year-old Amit Chauhan was getting into the festive mood, eating vegetable samosas and nodding to the music…",

Flags will fly to welcome and acknowledge those who fought in the Great Crusade. Over the summer, hundreds of commemorations will take place to mark 80 days of battle. \nWhile not the only contribution by Canadian service men and women, D-Day takes a prominent place in Canada’s cultural memory of the Second World War. \nAs a researcher of war heritage, I have observed and participated in commemorations in Normandy over the years.

          "description": "The US has announced it will resume a limited military presence in Somalia. The former administration withdrew troops from the country in 2020. The mission of the American soldiers is still what it has been for the last 15 years: to advise and assist Somali forces. US troops will not be directly involved in conflict. Their number, 450 to 500, is smaller than the last deployment. \nThe decision to redeploy in Somalia might appear to be surprising, for two important reasons. First, US president Joe Biden promised during his campaign to avoid the “forever wars” against terror lasting since 2002. None of these wars were ever fully won and remain unpopular with the US electorate. It is also surprising in the light of moves to restructure the US military to meet a threat from China. \nWhat better …",

Putin has warned that if Kiev receives long-range missiles, Russia will move and strike sites that have been off-target so far. -/Kremlin/dpa\nSupplying long-range missiles of Western manufacture to Ukraine will result in a strong response from Russian forces, President Vladimir Putin told state broadcaster Rossija 1.\n“If they supply, then we will draw the corresponding conclusions from this and deploy our means of destruction, of which we have enough, to deliver blows to those objects that we are not yet attacking,” he said. The West’s aim in supplying arms to Ukraine was to draw out the conflict, Putin said.\nThe Russian leader appeared relaxed about the delivery of modern HIMARS multiple rocket launchers announced by the United States, saying it would not change the balance of forces fundamentally. “There’s nothing new here,” he said, noting that the Ukrainian army already had similar, Russian-made systems and that US deliveries would just replace systems that had been destroyed.\nPrecisely which missiles were deployed would be decisive, Putin said. According to his information, missiles with ranges of between 45 and 70 kilometres would be supplied, similar to Russia’s Uragan, Smerch and Grad systems. Ukraine had 515 such systems when the \"operation\" began and is still thought to have 360, he said.",

I couldn't be more grateful.\"\nAside from his 1962 Pacific crossing, Horie is known for sailing around the world solo in 1974 and his longitudinal voyage around the world between 1978 and 1982.\nThe latest expedition was the first he had undertaken since 2008, when he sailed from Honolulu to the Kii Strait on a wave-powered 31-foot boat.\n© 2022 AFP",

Some cities, like Mariupol and now Severodonetsk where the fiercest fighting is taking place, effectively no longer existed, he said.\nPodoliak estimated Russian losses at a total of 80,000 people so far. This included dead and wounded among the regular army, the separatists and the mercenary force Wagner.\nHe said that after a disastrous initial phase of the war for Moscow, with up to 1,000 war dead per day, the current losses of Russian and Ukrainian troops were \"comparable.\"\nZelensky had recently put Ukrainian losses at up to 100 dead and 500 wounded per day.\nPeople inspect a destroyed Russian army tank about 40 km west of Kiev. 03 June is the 100th day of Russia's all-out war against Ukraine.

And the next day I lost all my sponsors,\" she told French television this week.\n\"I want to thank you for everything you've done for women's tennis and for women,\" Martina Navratilova said in the French Open video.\n\"What a beautiful tribute.

Recently, he has been making films about poets, which is not quite the same thing.\n“Biopic” is a clunky word for a prosaic genre, and biographies of screen writers are more likely to be literal than lyrical.  I thought “A Quiet Passion” Davies’ 2017 rendering of the life of Emily Dickinson was an exception, as attentive to the inner weather of her subject as to the details of her time and place.  Some of Dickinson’s admirers felt otherwise, but I still insist that the film and Cynthia Nixon’s central performance brought the poet’s idiosyncratic and indelible g…",

          "description": "Data from the app showed that in 2021, users hosted more than 3,600 bachelorette parties in Scottsdale, compared to about 13,000 in Nashville, said Mike Petrakis, 31, founder and chief executive of Bach.  This year, its data shows that more than 11,600 parties are planned in Scottsdale, compared to 30,000 in Nashville.  If that rate of growth continues in Scottsdale, Mr. Petrakis said, it has the potential to overtake Nashville in terms of bookings.  And on a recent weekend in May, more than one bachelor party attendee said Scottsdale was “the new Nashville.”\nRobert Mayer, 35, owner of Arizona Party Bike, said his Scottsdale location began booking a record number of bachelorette parties in the summer of 2020. Brides were looking for a place to celebrate without restrictions pandemics, he added.  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, never enacted a statewide mask mandate and reopened restaurants for indoor dining in May 2020. In Maricopa County , which includes Scottsdale, about 1,200 new Covid cases are currently reported per day.\nMr. Mayer’s company, which features on Bach, runs tours of the Old Town on cart-sized cranksets, charging up to $499 (plus the cost of alcohol) for two-hour private tours for up to 15 people.  His clientele is currently 75% female, with a median age of 28, he said.  Local outfitters of hot air balloons and desert jeep tours are also teeming with groups of women in their twenties singing Katy Perry songs and only occasionally throwing up.\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that the influx has already caused unrest.  One Saturday in May at the Arizona Party Bike depot in Old Town, Lacy Gray, 27, a company guide, had to explain the rules of the road to a South Dakota bachelor party after her members, sporting candy-colored wigs, took their seats at a neon-pink pedal bar.\nAn instruction?  No playback requests “‘WAP’, specifically,” Ms. Gray said.  (The song was proactively banned, Mr. Mayer added, after attracting stares from “disgruntled” pedestrians.)\n\nSource Link",

He pleaded no contest and his sentence included 12 months probation.\nLast year, former Dallas wide receiver Dez Bryant posted a video of Barber’s plays on Twitter and wrote that “he’s down…we’re just a stat and moments for Most people”.\nOn Monday, Bryant wrote on Twitter: “Too much to digest, so much to say… This is real life, it can be any one of us.

Barber rushed for 1,196 yards and 1,269 yards in 2003 and 2004.\nThe Cowboys selected him in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft.\nFootball was a family affair for barbers.  In addition to his father, Barber’s brothers, Thomas and Dominique, also played for the University of Minnesota Gophers.  Dominique was a defensive back with the Houston Texans of the NFL.\nIn a statement Thursday, PJ Fleck, head coach of the Gophers, said, “Marion was one of the best to ever play in Minnesota, and he’s a big reason a lot of people are Gopher fans today.”\n\n\nSource Link",

It was under his leadership that Citi Field opened in 2009 with so many Dodgers-related touches — including the enormous Jackie Robinson Rotunda — that some Mets fans complained there were no more winks. in Brooklyn than at the Mets.\nThe connections would only continue, with Mike Piazza’s Hall of Fame career spanning the franchises and Justin Turner, a crucial member of the current Dodgers squad, having started his career in orange and blue.\nNow Steven A. Cohen, who tried to buy the Dodgers in 2012, is calling the Mets shots.  In his first public remarks after buying the Mets, he cited the Dodgers as a model of what he hoped the Mets would become.  He backed that up by pushing the Mets payroll near the top of the sport.\n“They’re going to separate themselves from the pack,” said Valentine, who, in keeping with the connective tissue theme, was once married to a daughter of Ralph Branca, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  “Kind of like the Dodgers tried to do when they left town, and the Yankees always have.”\nTwo of Hodges’ adult children — Gil Jr., 72, and Irene, 71 — plan to be at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, along with two of Irene’s granddaughters and a cousin.  And as the videos roll and the lights flash, the iron steel cable that spans decades and miles will remain as strong as ever.\n“Without a doubt, the 1969 World Series was amazing,” says Irene Hodges of her favorite memory.  “Everyone was just thrilled.  All of Brooklyn was crazy.  It was a wonderful moment.  My dad, I think, was a little scared to manage in New York.  He knew how good the fans were here, how much they loved him, and he just wanted to do the right thing for them.  He wanted to have a successful team.  And he did.”\n\nSource Link",

Along the way, he became involved in Cali’s underworld, joining a gang of kidnappers and getting into the drug trade.\nIn the 1970s, he and his brother helped organize a loose confederation of drug gangs into what became known as the Cali Cartel.  Less authoritarian than Mr. Escobar’s Medellín Cartel, the Cali Confederacy cooperated on processing, shipping and distribution but otherwise gave its member gangs significant autonomy.\nYet, as the most successful members, the Rodríguez brothers were first among equals.  Miguel acted as a sort of general manager for the cartel, overseeing day-to-day operations, while Gilberto was the strategic visionary.  They also set the tone for the organization: no flashy parties, no flamboyant displays of wealth, and above all no unnecessary violence.\nMr. Rodríguez was also responsible for managing the cartel’s legitimate business interests.  He owned a chain of 400 pharmacies, a pharmaceutical laboratory, ranches, a radio network and America, a football club in Cali;  Mr. Rodríguez has served on banking boards and mingled with Colombia’s financial elite.\nAt first, he and Mr. Escobar got along well;  Jorge Ochoa Vázquez, a chef from Medellín, accompanied Mr. Rodríguez on a trip to Europe in 1984, where they sought to open up new markets.  (They were arrested in Spain for trafficking and extradited to Colombia, but Mr. Rodríguez was found not guilty.)\nSoon, however, the relationship between the two cartels soured.  Apart from rivalries in North American markets, they disagreed on how to fight back when, in the late 1980s, the Colombian government launched a campaign to stamp out drug trafficking.\nMr. Escobar preferred war and, over a period of five years, killed hundreds of police officers, politicians, lawyers and journalists.  Mr. Rodríguez hesitated, preferring to watch his two main threats tear apart from the sidelines.\n\nSource Link",

Although partnerships can include commercial and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local non-profit organizations.\nBut Mr Zelensky, who spoke to mayors 100 days after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia any extra credibility.\n” Do not apologize ;  don’t have relations with Russia,” said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech was applauded by mayors and city workers who had gathered in Reno, Nevada.  “And please don’t let those who have become murderers call your cities their sister cities.  ”\nPortland officials referenced a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners.

That framework involves Ukraine committing to neutrality with regard to NATO in exchange for some security guarantees, and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on the future of Crimea and the Donbas region.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This is going to go nowhere. Ukraine has/is not included in these \"discussions\", and Russian President Putin certainly no longer trusts the West. \nAs to where do both sides stand on a ceasefire? \nOn the Ukraine side President Zelensky has stipulated more than once that he would only agree to a ceasefire if Russian forces evacuated from all Ukrainian territories .... No Ukraine ceasefire deal without Russian withdrawal: Zelensky (Al Jazeera). \nA ceasefire offer was advanced by US Secretary of Defense Austin to his Russian counterpart Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov two weeks ago, but General Gerasimov declined. The Russian press said the reason why Austin's ceasefire proposal was refused were over concerns that a ceasefire would only be used to re-arm and reinforce the Ukraine military.",
