          "description": "Roger Ailes before his death told his wife that Rupert Murdoch’s two sons sought his ouster and wanted to turn Fox News into a centrist or even liberal outlet, Elizabeth Ailes said Thursday during an appearance on Newsmax.\n“Roger made running Fox News look easy, and as you know, it was anything but,” she told Newsmax host Eric Bolling.\n“Rupert has the checkbook, he has money, but he couldn't hold a candle to Roger in terms of genius, and the ideas that Roger put forth back in '96,” she said, noting that it was her late husband who developed the the right-wing network’s “fair and balanced” and “we report, you decide” slogans.\n“That was a challenge to the establishment mainstream media who thought that just because they said they were objective people we would take them at their word, and we all know that they were very liberal all that time.” \nThe former Fox News CEO’s wife claims that Murdoch’s sons, Lachlan and James, played a role in Ailes’ ouster from the company.\nRoger Ailes left Fox News in July 2016 amid a torrent of sexual harassment allegations by subordinates including Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. \n“My thought is that I go back to July 2016 when events unfolded, and after 20 years of running the channel and turning it into a $20 billion asset, throwing off $2 billion in profits, the sons Lachlan and James had decided that they wanted Roger gone,” she said.\n“Roger said to me, these useless kids tweedle dumb and tweedle dumber are going to ruin the channel and turn it into CNN and that's exactly what's happening,\" she added.\nWatch the video below or click here.\n\n\nNEWSMAXTV 05 18 2023 20 17 53\n\nwww.youtube.com",

The military forces and Indigenous communities will continue in their tireless search to give the country the news it is waiting for,\" he said in his retraction.\nMore than 100 soldiers have been deployed with sniffer dogs to search for the minors who were traveling in an airplane that crashed on May 1, leaving three adults including the pilot and the children's mother dead.\nRescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old include a 13, nine and four-year-old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.\n\"At this time there is no other priority other than progressing with the search until finding them,\" added Petro. \"The children's lives are the most important thing.\"\nPetro's stunning announcement on Wednesday had been met with uncertainty as he gave no details about where or how the children had been rescued, nor how they had survived alone in the jungle.\nAmid widespread confusion, the military has not confirmed any rescue.\nAvianline Charters, owner of the crashed aircraft, had previously said that one of its pilots in the search area was told the children had been found and that they \"were being transported by boat downriver and that they were all alive.\"\nBut the company also said that \"there has been no official confirmation\" that the children were out of danger, and thunderstorms posed a risk to them reaching safety.\nPetro said on Thursday that the news of the supposed rescue had been provided by the government's Institute of Family Welfare.\n© 2023 AFP",

We have to be wary,\" he added.\nSting -- real name Gordon Sumner -- shot to fame with The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as \"Roxanne\", \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Walking on the Moon\".\nHe then forged a solo career with classics such as \"Englishman in New York\", \"Fields of Gold\" and \"Shape of My Heart\".\n© 2023 AFP",

Jason Robertson/Released \nNew York Times: The Latest Flash Point Among Ukraine’s Allies Is Whether to Send F-16s \nA fresh push by Britain and the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter planes has exposed the latest fault line among Western allies who have wrangled repeatedly over sending powerful weapons of war, once again pitting a reluctant United States against some of its closest European partners. \nSeveral European allies are prepared to give their F-16s to Ukraine. But the Biden administration, which must approve any transfers of the American-made planes, remains unconvinced that Ukraine needs the expensive jets, which are a staple of many modern military arsenals. \nSo deep is Washington’s skepticism that Kyiv’s pilots are currently not even allowed to train on the F-16s that are owned by European states, according to a senior Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity to frankly discuss the sensitive diplomatic issue.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: This is why the US is skeptical on sending F-16s to Ukraine ....
