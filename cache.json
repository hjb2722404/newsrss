Given how long it takes to build modern naval warships, the U.S. needs to start building now if it is to have the fleet it will need to deter Chinese aggression. \nLast year, Navy Adm. Phil Davidson, the former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, cautioned Congress that China is preparing to move against Taiwan by 2027. That assessment is shared by the current Indo-Pacific commander, the current CIA director, and Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state and ex-CIA director. \nWhy 2027? Eyeing negative economic and demographic trends, and the regional military balance, Chinese leaders worry that the odds they’ll be able to achieve their long-held goal of conquering Taiwan will fade with each passing year after that.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: I do not see the military balance shifting back to the U.S. after 2027.

          "description": "Fortune: ‘We realized that there’s no way we can return’: Russia’s best and brightest are leaving the country in record numbers. 6 young Russians explain why they left \nThree months ago, Sonya, a 25-year-old who works at a major mobile gaming company and moonlights as a tutor, made one of the toughest decisions of her life: She left Russia. \nShe had an old but cozy communal apartment with her boyfriend and two other roommates in Moscow’s city center, a tight-knit group of friends, and spent several days a week taking classes at a local dance academy—her lifelong passion. \n “It’s my home. My family, friends are there. My whole life. How can you possibly abandon all these things?\" she told Fortune. \nBut like countless other young educated Russians, Sonya, who asked that only her first name be used, packed her bags and fled the country after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Russians emigrating out of Russia is nothing new. My cousin's daughter asked for my help a few weeks ago to sponsor her immigration application to Canada (I said yes). What is different is that since the start of the war the numbers are higher, and those who are leaving are much younger. \nBut starting a new life in another country is no easy task, especially since sanctions have cut-off any financial resources that Russian immigrants may have back home. Many countries in the West are also now in a recession, and well paying jobs are in short supply.",

Broad evidence shows Moscow has not narrowed its goals in Ukraine, a point vital to any notion for peace talks. (Tyler Hicks/The New York Times)   \nL.A. Times: Six months of war in Ukraine — and it's only growing more dangerous \nFar from bogging down in a stalemate, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has evolved into an increasingly dangerous conflict as it passes the six-month mark, with fighting around Europe's largest nuclear plant, a high-profile assassination in Moscow, escalating threats and daring Ukrainian attacks in Russian-held territory.\n\"The dynamic of the battlefield\" is shifting, said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of U.S. Army Europe. Armed with increasingly lethal weapons from the U.S. and other allies, Ukraine has been able to occasionally seize the initiative and surprise Russian forces. \nIt is not clear, however, how long that can last or whether Ukraine can build on those small victories enough to dictate the course of the war.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I am focused on the massive battles that are now occurring in the Donbas.
