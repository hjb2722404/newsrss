Sweden should be a free country'.\"\nIn a televised debate in early May, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson said it was \"insane\" that taxpayers' money was being used for drag queen story hours.\nHe took issue in particular with a drag artist known as \"Shameless Winehore\" but who goes by the name \"Miss Shameless\" for story hours.\nIn a video clip posted on Twitter, Jonsson is seen glammed up wearing a curly blonde wig, fake eyelashes, a sky-blue dress with red flowers and high heels.\nOn a chair, surrounded by children seated on the floor, Jonsson reads a passage from \"The Brothers Lionheart\" by famed Swedish children's author Astrid Lindgren about standing up for your beliefs even if it's dangerous.\n\"Stories are not dangerous for kids. And drag queens aren't either. But populism and intolerance are dangerous for kids and for adults,\" Jonsson says in the advert.\nJonsson has previously fronted a Liberal campaign against Sweden's soaring gang crime, where the slender politician, clad in a floral shirt and blue blazer was dubbed the \"gangs' worst enemy\".\n¬© 2023 AFP",
