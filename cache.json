Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.\n\"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy,\" said Austin. \"I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.\"\n\"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"That's our policy,\" said Austin.\nWatch below or click here.\n\n\nLloyd Austin calls on Tommy Tuberville to drop military block\n\nwww.youtube.com",

An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.\nHis attorney said that he had been \"eaten alive.\"\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates \"do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.\" \n“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,\" she said. \nClarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a \"racial justice issue,\" citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail. \nRead the full report at The Washington Post.",

Now you add that we’re giving a lot of munitions away to the Ukrainians — which I think is exactly what we need to do — but now we’re getting dangerously low and sometimes, in some cases even too low that we don’t have enough,” said Gen. James Hecker. \nWASHINGTON — Amid a high tempo of arms transfers to Ukraine, the stockpile of US weapons and those of allies are getting “dangerously low,” the commander of US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) said today. And worse, he warned, no “short term” fixes are on the horizon. \nSpeaking on a panel with the air chiefs of the United Kingdom and Sweden during the Chief of the Air Staff’s Global Air & Space Chiefs’ Conference in London, USAFE Commander Gen. James Hecker, who also leads US air forces in Africa, urged fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization members to take a hard look at the status of their weapon stockpiles.  \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: US, NATO Weapons Stockpile At \"Dangerously Low\" Levels: Top Air Force General (Zero Hedge/Epoch Times)\n\n \nWNU Editor: The U.S. is definitely not ready to fight a major war.",
