According to President Joe Biden's administration, investigators foiled another plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States.\nAmong the most startling details in the Justice Department's statement is an alleged revelation from Gupta to an undercover DEA agent that another Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, \"was also the target.\" \nIn fact, he revealed, \"We have so many targets.\"\nALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says heâs about to prove it in court.\nSikh groups, including some active in the United States and Canada, have vocally advocated for their own state to be parsed out of India. \nThe Diplomat detailed leaked Pakistani documents it says point to an assassination program being orchestrated by India, though the site claimed the leak is attempting to capitalize on India's negative publicity. \nThe Intercept's report last week also cited the same intelligence assessment, saying that the Indian government's \"Research and Analysis Wing\" has been plotting a global assassination plot in several countries in a coordinated effort to target Sikh and Kashmiri activists abroad. \nRead the full court filing by the DOJ here.",
