Since then, there have been only one mass shooting in Australia, and gun homicides decreased nearly 60 percent.  Correspondent Seth Doane talks with Australian politicians, and with a victim and gunowner, about the sweeping changes. (A previous version of this story was broadcast on March 13, 2016.)",

The other three are focusing on sustainable finance, green building and artificial meats. And, as the key element in a compulsory credit-bearing course, each event is specifically intended to provide practical, experiential learning by exposing the students to wide range of issues - some foreseeable, others unexpected - for which solutions must be found.    \r \r  The two MCs on Monday night will be Mirjam Wong, otherwise a regional IT project manager with a leading global cosmetics company, and Adrian Chong, who since last September has been policy manager for an international accountancy association. \r \r \r \r Understandably at this stage, both are feeling a few butterflies. But those should be calmed after the last few rehearsals and technical run-throughs and by knowing they have a strong line-up of speakers, a topical subject, and back-ups just in case of the odd glitch. \r \r “Even when you plan as well as possible, something will go wrong on the day, especially when technology is involved,” says Wong, who also served as the research coordinator. “But you have to be ready…",

[…] I think we see that happening every day,” Garlinghouse said.\nHe went on to say that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are “underappreciated, despite the fact that there is obviously a lot of hype in some parts of the NFT market.”  Specifically:\n\n“The tokenization of various assets is underestimated.” \n\nGarlinghouse cited the trade in carbon credits, which is often “challenged” by fraudulent activities, such as a use case for tokenization thanks to its transparency and traceability.  “It could really revolutionize carbon credit markets, the efficiency of carbon credit markets,” Garlinghouse said.  Ripple is investing $100 million in the segment, he added. \nRelated: WEF 2022: Trust and clarity lacking in carbon emissions and crypto talks\nCryptocurrency will have real-world use cases in 2022, Garlinghouse continued.  Cross-border transactions are an example that Ripple is working on.  Currently, cross-border transactions are “generally quite slow, quite expensive, and frankly very error-prone,” while the XRP blockchain has been “a very efficient and inexpensive bridge,” he said.\n“I don’t think we live in a one-channel world,” Garlinghouse said.  “It’s a multi-channel world, there will be a lot of different utility use cases.”  Ripple will continue to focus on businesses, but other cryptocurrency foundations are also looking at consumer use cases, he explained. \nThe full conversation is on our Youtube channel.

The recent guest column in the Gazette (“A Call for Optional Masking in Schools,” May 21) is another ill-informed screed against masking that could have kept our students safe had the mask mandate remained in place. square.\nScores of Northampton students, staff and families have fallen ill after the mask mandate was removed.  That’s why the warrant was returned.  You had your say and the masks were removed to the detriment of more than a hundred high school students alone.\nMaskChoice Northampton is not a choice.  This reflects a common care deficit for your wider community, those who are vulnerable and those who are not.  A speech-language pathologist is not a pediatric care provider or medical professional.  Few of our city’s pediatricians or public health providers agree with your short-sighted desire to rekindle the outbreak of disease that always follows mandatory mask removal. \nI can only hope you don’t succeed in your quest to put children and families at risk, including my own student who ultimately experienced a case of COVID after being exposed by an official count more than 20 times at the high school despite wearing his mask.\nI wish you and your families good health and safety at school.

In return for some mumbo-jumbo about al-Qaida, Trump pledged total, unconditional US and Nato withdrawal within 14 months. \nThis was not peacemaking. This was capitulation. The Taliban could hardly believe their luck.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This is what \"Trump derangement syndrome looks like in the UK\". \nIt is amazing to me on how utterly detached from any true sense of reality some people in the West have become even as disaster looms. That it is not President Biden's fault, but the fault of Trump and Putin who are working together to discredit Biden's global leadership and policies.\nAnd while I find this type of analysis paranoid and bizarre, I am willing to bet that this Guardian opinion post written by one of its chief correspondents is shared by many in London and in Washington DC. That the disaster that we are seeing is not the fault at all of our current leaders, but the fault of others.",
