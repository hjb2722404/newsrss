          "description": "British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.\nLead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.\nGahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.\n\"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil,\" he said of their 19th tour.\nThe band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words \"Berlin 4.10.22\".\nCredited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, \"Spirit\", in 2017. \"Memento Mori\" will be their 15th studio record.\nDepeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.\nThe band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as \"Personal Jesus\", \"People Are People\" and \"Enjoy the Silence\".\nThe group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.\n¬© 2022 AFP",

Nevertheless, defense spending from January to April totaled almost 1.6 trillion rubles ($26.4 billion), with about 500 billion rubles ($8.3 billion) of spending per month for March and April. Considering these dynamics in comparison with Moscow‚Äôs defense spending in previous years‚Äîroughly 300 billion rubles ($5 billion) per month‚Äîand the fact that the original defense budget in 2022 was 3.85 trillion rubles ($63.6 billion), the true amount for Russian defense spending in 2022 may well reach as much as 5.5 trillion rubles ($90.9 billion) by the end of the year (Budget.gov.ru, May 2022).  ¬†\nRead more ....  ¬†\nWNU Editor: The last thing that is on the Kremlin's mind right now is balancing their budget.
