Pancholi owned and operated Shring Home Care Inc, a home health company, and used others' information to conceal his ownership. He and his co-conspirators billed and received payment from Medicare for services that were never provided. Pancholi then transferred the funds to shell corporations and eventually to his accounts in India. He also attempted to obstruct justice by writing false emails.

The Campi Flegrei is a flat volcano that has recently shown increased activity. Experts believe that there may be more intense tremors in the future. The area is home to half a million people, and the last eruption occurred in 1538. The recent spike in activity is likely caused by gas bubbling up, making an eruption less likely.",

Since my grandfather's time, the royal family has always competed in sports.\"\nShe is the latest in a line of royals to compete in top-level equestrianism -- Britain's Zara Phillips was a 2012 Olympics silver medallist.\nAway from the sporting domain, Sirivannavari is a keen fashion designer and has had shows at Paris Fashion Week.\nShe cited her sister as inspiration for being in China.\n\"I do it for my sister. My sister is a horse-lover and a show-jumper and she wants to be on the national team, but she cannot make it,\" she said.\n\"So she gave everything to me: all the information, all of her strategy, all of the equipment.\"\nHer elder sister, Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol, was hospitalised late last year for heart, lung and kidney issues.",

The staff suffered no harm,\" said Bruno Rodriguez in a post on social media platform X.\nThis was the second attack against the Cuban mission in Washington in recent years, after a man opened fire on the building in April 2020. There were no injuries from that attack. \nThe Sunday night attack took place hours after Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel returned to Havana after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York and other activities with Cubans in the US.\nIn New York, there had been demonstrations by Cubans resident in the United States against Diaz-Canel's presence at the UN, according to posts and videos shared on social media.\n\"The anti-Cuban groups resort to terrorism when feeling they enjoy impunity, something that Cuba has repeatedly warned the US authorities about,\" said Rodriguez after Sunday's attack.\nIn April 2020, the Cuban foreign minister summoned the then US charge d'affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, to express his \"energetic protest\" over what he called a \"terrorist aggression\" against his embassy.\nThat shooting left bullet holes in exterior walls and columns, broke a street lamp and damaged several panes of glass and moldings on the front of the building. \nUS authorities arrested Alexander Alazo, then 42, for the attack.\nAlazo was indicted in July 2020 and charged with multiple offences, including \"violent attack on a foreign official or official premises using a deadly weapon\", according to the US Justice Department. \n© Agence France-Presse\nuscuba",

I see the opposite. This Ukraine counteroffensive has burned its best troops and thousands of pieces of Western equipment, and in any other situation a government would sue for peace. But the West, specifically the U.S. government and some of its allies, are hell-bent on continuing this war. They are going to continue the flow of monies and war equipment to Kyiv, even if it will mean the death of hundreds of thousands of more Ukrainians. And if President Biden is re-elected in 2024, God only knows where this conflict is going to end.",
