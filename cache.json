Those final works were gathered together for an exhibition at the Musee D'Orsay, in Paris, where correspondent Seth Doane spoke with curators about the artist's tortured, but inspired, last months alive, and the museum's effort to gain new insight into Van Gogh through artificial intelligence. \"Hello Vincent\" is a digital version of the painter that is able to converse and answer questions using artificial intelligence to comb through all the information we know about Van Gogh, including his most personal thoughts as expressed through hundreds of letters he wrote during his lifetime. Doane asks AI Van Gogh some pressing questions about his work and legacy.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",
