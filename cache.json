Mexican drug cartels have increasingly taken part in the illegal business.\nOverdoses of the opioid killed more than 100,000 people in the 2022 U.S. fiscal year, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended in the March 22 letter efforts to curb supply of the drug, while rounding on U.S. critics, some of whom want Washington to intervene militarily in Mexico.\nThe letter and China's response did not mention supplies of the precursor chemicals used to make the powerful sedative.\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says both finished fentanyl and precursors are transported from China to Mexico, the United State and Canada, often by international mail.\n(Reporting by Yew Lun Tian; Writing by Liz Lee; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel)",

          "description": "Fresh images from inside a crippled reactor at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant revealed heavy damage to its foundation and significant debris, its operator said.\nTokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) on Tuesday released a series of video clips from a robotic survey inside Fukushima Daiichi plant's Reactor 1, one of three that suffered core meltdowns in 2011.\n\"There were areas that we could not see. But we believe (damage) is spread across large areas,\" a TEPCO official told a briefing.\nThe video showed damaged concrete walls exposing steel rods embedded inside, with debris piled roughly 50 centimetres (20 inches) high.\nThe video illustrated the daunting task ahead to decommission the plant after it was hit by a huge tsunami triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake.\nTEPCO and the government expect to spend 30 to 40 years removing molten fuel from the facility and cleaning the area.\nSimilar video surveys have been conducted in the two other reactors that went into meltdown.\nThe new video comes as local residents voice worries about the safety of the precarious structure in an earthquake-prone region.\nFukushima governor Masao Uchibori pressed TEPCO to conduct an earthquake resistance evaluation for the facility to ensure the safety of the project to dismantle the plant.\n\"Because of the high radiation levels inside the reactors, I understand that robots that use semiconductors do not function as well as they are designed,\" he told his regular press conference on Monday.\n\"The biggest and most difficult task is the removal of the debris (molten fuel). We demand TEPCO and the government carry out the decommissioning project safely and steadily.\"\nTEPCO has said it will conduct a seismic resistance survey in a few months, but previous surveys have indicated that the facility remains relatively stable.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Marketwatch: Here’s what is really behind OPEC+ oil-production cuts, say energy analysts \nAn unexpected production cut announced on Sunday by OPEC+ oil producers complicates strained relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with investors seeing signs of geopolitical posturing in the decision. \nHowever, some market analysts contend the cuts were less about sending a message to Washington and more about stabilizing oil prices amid fears of recession, as well as protecting the supply and demand balances. \nSaudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday announced they would slash a further combined 1.16 million barrels per day of oil production from May until the end of 2023. Russia, stinging from price caps and embargoes on its energy products as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, said it would extend its 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut through year-end. Together OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, make up the group known as OPEC+.\n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: The US was caught completely off-guard by this OPEC+ decision to cut oil production. This is a surprise because China, India, and a few other big oil consumers were given a heads-up that this was going to happen. \nI see this as another indication on how strained U.S. - Saudi ties have become, and how furious the Saudis are with the Biden administration's determination to bring down the price of oil via through price caps and selling America's strategic oil reserve on the open markets. \nBottom line. \nExpect $100/barrel in the coming months, and a return to higher gas prices by this summer .... Gas prices will surge in coming weeks after OPEC cuts production, analysts say (FOX News).",
