As a former politician, diplomat, and now leader of NATO, he knows that it is a rule for people in these positions to always look clean shaven, neat, and sharp looking. \nHe definitely did not look like that today.

His tie was crooked, hair was messed-up, and this is the first time that I have seen him unshaven. \nOptics and perception is important to political leaders like Jens Stoltenberg. They always take the time to look good. My gut tells me that he is becoming stressed by the Russia - Ukraine war, or more to the point, the intelligence that he has access to is painting a very grim picture on what is really happening in eastern Ukraine. \nLong meetings. Continuous bad news. NATO members with their own agendas. Keeping a unified message among the alliance.

Image credit: Creative Commons. \n19FortyFive: There Is No Military Path for Ukraine To ‘Defeat’ Russia \nThe Tide of Battle – and Mounting Casualties – Turning Against Ukraine – Since it became evident a few weeks into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that Moscow’s troops were stopped cold outside of Kyiv, there has been a near-universal belief in the West that Ukraine would eventually win. All that was needed, many pundits claimed, was to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces sufficient numbers of weapons and ammunition. As the war now grinds towards the four-month mark, it is becoming painfully evident that the odds are stacked in Russia’s favor. \nMilitarily speaking, there is no rational path through which Ukraine will ever win its war. Without a course correction – and soon – Kyiv itself may not ultimately be safe.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: You know the situation is deteriorating fast when Ukraine President Zelensky's top adviser is making an urgent request to NATO at their meeting this Wednesday for these weapons (see tweet below). \nUkraine had most of these weapons before the war, and to me this adviser is admitting that they now need to be replaced because most have been lost and destroyed. A testament to how brutal this war is becoming. \nI am also being told by one source in Ukraine that I trust that the Ukrainian military losses are not 100 - 200 soldiers a day, but two to three times that. If true, these numbers are staggering, and you cannot sustain a war with that type of losses, let alone mounting a counter-offensive to defeat the Russian military. \n\nBeing straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity:\n 1000 howitzers caliber 155 mm;\n 300 MLRS;\n 500 tanks;\n 2000 armored vehicles;\n 1000 drones.\nContact Group of Defense Ministers meeting is held in #Brussels on June 15.
