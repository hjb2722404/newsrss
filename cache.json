But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

And [in] the media space, there is clearly pro-Russian propaganda, there is [a] clear pro-Russian narrative. If you look into the investigations about the cyber attacks, many of the IP addresses were coming from Russia,\" Ana Revenco said.",

During his administration's final days in office in January 2021, the United States added Cuba back to its list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nThat designation occurred the same month that Cuba's government moved to end its parallel currencies, phasing out a convertible peso that was pegged to the dollar, leaving only the regular, weaker peso, or CUP.\nSince then, the currency has fallen from 24 to an official rate of 120 to the dollar. On the black market, the rate is 185.\nTrump's successor Joe Biden has kept up the prior administration's restrictions on Cuba, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken in March said the United States had no plans to lift the state sponsor of terrorism designation.\n© Agence France-Presse",

China has a four-tier, color-coded weather-warning system, with red representing the most severe warning and blue the least severe.\nOn Tuesday morning, smog and misty grey clouds could be seen enveloping Beijing and the city's real-time air quality index was at a serious pollution level, according to the website of the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.\nThe concentration of fine particulates in the air in Beijing is currently 46.2 times the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline value, according to IQAir, a website that issues air quality data and information.\nA dozen provinces, including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Hubei, Inner Mongolia and metropolis Shanghai, will be affected by sandstorms and major dust until 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) Wednesday, the Central Meteorological Observatory said.\nThe sandstorms were again a hot dicussion topic on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, racking up 2.178 million chats.\nOne user wrote, \"What! When I wake up, why doesn't anyone issue a holiday notice, do you still have to go to work in the dust today!\"\nBeijing has regular sandstorms in March and April as it is near the large Gobi desert.\nA Chinese government official at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recently said the number of sandstorms was now four times higher than in the 1960s, a consequence of rising temperatures and lower precipitation in the deserts of north China and neighbouring Mongolia.\n(Reporting by Bernard Orr; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

The hypothetical scenarios include the deaths of Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the removal of leadership within the Russian Armed Forces and a Ukrainian strike on the Kremlin.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Here is my take on these four \"wild card\" scenarios.\n\nThe death of Putin will only mean the ascension of a hardcore leader. That person will probably be Patrushev Nikolai. \nIf Zelensky should die. It is hard to say who will replace him. There will be many contenders to that job, but all of them will continue Zelensky's war policies and strategies. \nI do not see the complete removal of the Russian military leadership happening anytime soon. Certainly not in the middle of a war. \nThe scenario that I do see happening is a Ukrainian military strike on the Kremlin. But this will only escalate the war, and it will also change Russian rules of engagement to now directly target the Ukrainian leadership. \nMy biggest fear/scenario is that Ukraine uses a dirty bomb that will make Red Square and the area surrounding the Kremlin a no-go to place for generations. In this nightmare scenario Russia will respond with nuclear weapons against Ukraine, and will launch conventional military strikes against NATO military sites that are providing intelligence/logistical/and hardware support for Ukraine's war efforts.",

Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) introduced a bill seeking authorization for the use of military force to “put us at war with the cartels.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said he is open to sending U.S. troops into Mexico to target drug lords even without that nation’s permission. And lawmakers in both chambers have filed legislation to label some cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move supported by GOP presidential aspirants.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: I would not recommend this course of action.",

Although different groups may be behind the attacks from those places, these groups are likely all linked to Iran. The groups involved include Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and others that may go by different or new names, but which are proxies of Tehran. \nIran has long sought to bring its conflict with Israel to the Jewish state’s borders. Its backing of Hezbollah and Hamas was key to that strategy over the decades. For instance, Tehran supplies Hamas with financial support and also helped it develop longer-range rockets and a larger arsenal. Whereas Hamas rockets could once only travel a few kilometers, now they can reach most parts of Israel. \nThe Islamic Republic also supported Islamic Jihad, which is even more of an Iranian proxy than Hamas. The group not only has an arsenal thought to include thousands of rockets, but it has gunmen in the West Bank and its leadership often resides in Damascus.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The mood in Israel is that they are now facing Iran and its allies on multiple-fronts ....

Michael McCaul has said the US may send troops to Taiwan should China invade the self-governed island. \n“If communist China invaded Taiwan, it would certainly be on the table and something that would be discussed by Congress and with the American people,” the Texas Republican told Fox News. \n“Are they prepared to do this? Is Taiwan worth it? I can argue for a lot of reasons why it is.” \nThe potential move would represent a stark contrast to the th\ne war in Ukraine, where the US has sent billions in weaponry to Kyiv but has refused to send troops. \n\n“[To deploy troops,] you’re talking about an authorized use of military force that would come out of my committee or a declaration of war, which we haven’t utilized since World War II,” McCaul said during a three-day trip to Taipei at the head of a congressional delegation.\n\n \nRead more .... \n\n \nUpdate: Conflict with China 'last resort' but Congress will authorize troops if Americans support it: McCaul (FOX News).\n\n \nWNU Editor: I do not see the American public supporting a policy to go to war against China to defend Taiwan. But I could be wrong.\n\n \nUpdate #2: House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul is correct about this .... McCaul says China could influence, take over Taiwan in next election ‘without a shot fired’ (The Hill). Taiwan President Tsai’s party suffered losses in recent local elections (link here), and my gut tells me that many Taiwanese do not want to suffer the same fate as Ukraine. That diplomacy and accommodation with China are the preferred options. \n\n \nUpdate #3: The Chinese are sending a message to Washington .... China military ‘ready to fight’ after drills near Taiwan (AP).",
