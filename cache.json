          "description": "British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.\nLead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.\nGahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.\n\"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil,\" he said of their 19th tour.\nThe band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words \"Berlin 4.10.22\".\nCredited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, \"Spirit\", in 2017. \"Memento Mori\" will be their 15th studio record.\nDepeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.\nThe band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as \"Personal Jesus\", \"People Are People\" and \"Enjoy the Silence\".\nThe group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.\n© 2022 AFP",

As a result, I'm announcing we are not proceeding with the abolition of the ... rate.\n\"We get it, and we have listened.\"\nThe announcement also came after former cabinet ministers Grant Shapps and Michael Gove voiced opposition over unfunded tax cuts unveiled by Kwarteng in his controversial mini-budget on September 23.\nKwarteng had proposed to remove the 45-percent rate applied to Britons earning more than £150,000 ($167,400) per year.\nThe so-called mini budget had sent the pound plunging to a record dollar low and sent bond yields spiking on fears of a borrowing splurge.\nThe budget included a costly freeze on energy bills for individuals and businesses, in an attempt to cushion fallout from key gas producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n(AFP)",

Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.\nLula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.\n\nWith 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:\n\nWith 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:\n\n\nLula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.\nTo win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.\nPolls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.\nOfficial results can be found here: latest Brazil Election Results",

          "description": "Jamestown Foundation: Russia’s Skyrocketing Defense Spending, 2022–2023 \n 1) Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine has forced the Kremlin to ramp up defense spending in a big way. \n2) The turbulence in Russian defense spending will probably increase in 2023. \n3) The skyrocketing defense budget means less flexibility and efficiency for Russian government spending. \nRussia’s continued aggression against Ukraine and the Kremlin’s attempts to escalate the political situation and prevent defeat on the battlefield through mobilization, nuclear blackmail and possibly even sabotage on gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea raise the question: How do all these factors influence the Russian defense budget? \nSince May 2022, the Russian government has not released much data on the defense budget. Nevertheless, defense spending from January to April totaled almost 1.6 trillion rubles ($26.4 billion), with about 500 billion rubles ($8.3 billion) of spending per month for March and April. Considering these dynamics in comparison with Moscow’s defense spending in previous years—roughly 300 billion rubles ($5 billion) per month—and the fact that the original defense budget in 2022 was 3.85 trillion rubles ($63.6 billion), the true amount for Russian defense spending in 2022 may well reach as much as 5.5 trillion rubles ($90.9 billion) by the end of the year (Budget.gov.ru, May 2022).   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The last thing that is on the Kremlin's mind right now is balancing their budget.

Deliveries were halted by Russia in May. \n4) Turk Stream, delivering gas from Russia under the Black Sea and through the Balkans, has a capacity of 31.5 bcm and is the only pipeline still in operation. It terminates in Hungary, meaning that as of now, Hungary is the only EU member state still receiving Russian natural gas. \nDue to the huge income Russia has made from soaring gas prices, coupled with a massive reduction in other trade with Europe, Russia has no interest in completely shutting down these pipelines.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: If this continues Hungary will be the envy of Europe later this winter.
