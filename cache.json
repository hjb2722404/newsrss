          "description": "At noon on Thursday, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jnr will take his presidential oath on the steps of the Philippines’ former legislature, where his late father-president was once confronted by student activists with a black paper-mache coffin and a crocodile. His inauguration as the nation’s 17th president will be “very solemn and simple”, event organisers said. “We will not stray from tradition,” Marcos Jnr said. Historian Ambeth Ocampo surmised that the venue – the National Museum of Fine Arts building which used to house the Philippine Congress until Marcos Snr shut it down in 1972 – was chosen for its “optics”. Its American colonial-style period columns mimic the backdrop for the inauguration of US presidents who take their oath on the steps of the Capitol. Whoever picked the venue did not know Philippine history, said Ocampo, a former head of the National Historical Commission, on Sunday. First, Ocampo said, all three presidents who took their oaths there – Manuel Quezon, Jose Laurel and Manuel Roxas – not only failed to finish their term, two of them – Quezon and Roxas – died while in office. Second, “that is where the First Quarter Storm began”, said Ocampo, referring to the series of increasingly violent student protests following the 1969 election, in which Marcos Snr was accused of having cheated to win a second term. What does a Marcos Jnr presidency mean for Asean and democracy in the region? Playwright Bonifacio Ilagan, 70, intends to spend inauguration day protesting Marcos Jnr’s assumption to the presidency, in the same way he protested against his father 52 years ago when Marcos Snr delivered his State of the Nation Address on January 26, 1970, in the same building. He said on Monday: “I don’t know if Marcos Jnr realises that the venue was a historic site for student unrest and radicalisation.” Ilagan, who was jailed and tortured during Marcos Snr’s dictatorship, is the convenor of The Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law (CARMMA). Authorities have branded Ilagan and his…",

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r The Hong Kong Government is committed to promoting the development of innovation and technology and to grow Hong Kong as an international technology hub. Scientific work and technology has helped humankind in amazingly creative and innovative ways. Last year, the Hong Kong Innovation Foundation (HKIF) launched the first-ever Hong Kong Science Fair to encourage and challenge young minds to ‘Think Big Be Innovative’. Science projects provide opportunities for students to explore, learn from research and to discover new things. The Hong Kong Science Fair encourages students to be innovative and use technology to look at problems in different ways and to solve them. It is important to offer such opportunities to young people as it allows them to go through the thinking process which helps to develop their creativity and problem-solving skills. Interest in innovation and technology also grows as they grow these life-long skills.\r \r According to the Global Innovation Index 2020, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou technology cluster is ranked the world’s second largest. With increased funding and investment in the necessary infrastructure from the Hong Kong government, the start-up ecosystem has expanded with a 6% rise in the number of start-ups in 2020 from the previous year (source: HKTDC). Hong Kong start-up’ major focuses include information and communication technologies (ICT), software as a service (SaaS), the Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, biotech, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), as well as new materials.

          "description": "A trial began Sunday for an Egyptian man accused of stabbing a woman to death in a public street after she rejected his advances -- a case that has sparked widespread outrage.\nA video went viral last week appearing to show the victim, identified as student Nayera Ashraf, being stabbed by a young man outside her university.\nThe crime has triggered widespread anger both in Egypt and beyond, having been followed a few days later by a similar incident in which Jordanian student Iman Irshaid was shot dead on a university campus.\nSocial media users immediately drew comparisons between the two murders, decrying cases of femicide in the Arab world.\nAt the Mansoura Criminal Court, 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Cairo, Mohamed Adel was accused of \"premeditated murder\", after confessing to intentionally killing the victim, an AFP correspondent said.\nAshraf had previously reported the alleged perpetrator to the authorities, fearing that he would attack her, according to her father and witnesses.\nThe maximum penalty for murder is death in Egypt, which carried out the third highest number of executions in the world in 2021, according to Amnesty International.\n\"He stabbed her several times,\" said the prosecution, which found \"messages threatening to cut her throat\" on the victim's phone.\nThe next hearing is set for Tuesday, the defendant's lawyer, Ahmed Hamad, told AFP.\nIn a rare occurrence among cases involving violence against women, authorities allowed television cameras to film the hearing on Sunday.\nOn social media, many Jordanian and Egyptian users called for the perpetrator to be sentenced to death, while others said men must \"learn to take no for an answer\".\nEgyptian preacher Mabrouk Attia sparked outrage last week after suggesting that the victim would not have met the same fate had she been veiled.\nNearly eight million Egyptian women were victims of violence committed by their partners or relatives, or by strangers in public spaces, according to a United Nations survey conducted in 2015.\n© 2022 AFP",

José Ricardo Orozco told local Blu Radio. “Four people have died, as of this moment: two women, a man and a minor.”\nMayor Juan Carlos Tamayo said 800 spectators were seated in the sections that collapsed.\nLate Sunday, Tolima health secretary Martha Palacios said in a press conference that 322 people had gone to local public and private hospitals after the collapse seeking treatment. Palacio said the minor who had died was an 18-month-old baby.\nBesides the four dead, another four people were in intensive care and two others recovering from surgery.\nOrozco said he had asked for the traditional “corralejas” to be suspended in Tolima earlier Sunday but this one was held anyway.\nPresident-elect Gustavo Petro urged local officials to ban such events, noting that it was not the first time an incident like this had taken place.\n“I ask mayors not to allow more events involving the death of people or animals,” he said.\nCurrent President Iván Duque on Twitter announced an investigation of the disaster.\n“We lament the terrible tragedy registered in El Espinal, Tolima, during the festivals of San Pedro and San Juan, with the collapse of the stands during a corraleja. We will call for an investigation.”\n(AP)",

But those who want an extension of the Beckett brand can come to New York University instead. Skirball center for “Cascando”, an adaptation of a Beckett radio play from the early 1960s. It comes courtesy of Pan Pan Theateran Irish company with a carefree approach to the classics.\nOriginally created in collaboration with composer Marcel Mihalovici, “Cascando” is intended as a passive audio experience.  But this “Cascando,” directed by Gavin Quinn and designed by Aedin Cosgrove, adds a participatory element.\nUpon arrival, each ticket holder is equipped with a black hooded robe and a pair of headphones.

(Especially since that car, with over 150,000 miles and a check engine light that always seemed to be on, made me a regular mechanic.)\nBut then I traded in my trash of a car for a shiny, clean Subaru Crosstrek that still had that new-car smell.

So to save money on gas, she cut back on extracurricular driving, as well as some more essential activities.\nMs Lopez, 30, used to walk to the grocery store without thinking twice.  Now, because of inflation and high prices to get to the store, she only goes there every two weeks.

In February, when Democratic lawmakers explored the ideaSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, called it a gimmick.\n\n\nThe national average for regular gasoline was $4.98 a gallon on Monday, according to AAAafter $5 topping this month.  Oil and refined fuel prices hit their highest level in 14 years, largely due to The Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions, as well as a rebound in energy consumption as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\nThe White House and congressional Democrats have been discussing a nationwide gas tax exemption as one of the few options to reduce the cost at the pump, as external factors have been key drivers behind the surge. price.  The high cost of gas is emerging as a significant handicap for Mr. Biden and Democratic lawmakers as the midterm elections approach.\nWhen gas prices jumped in March, the White House turned towards the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, ordering the release of up to one million barrels of oil a day for 180 days in hopes of meeting demand.  The overall effect has been limited and gasoline prices remain close to record highs.\nMr Biden said on Monday that his team planned to meet with the CEOs of major oil companies this week.  He reprimanded some of the biggest oil companies last week to make a profit as US consumers suffered high prices.\n\nSource Link",

Certainly not the economy imploding or the ruble crashing as President Biden was saying in March. \nMy prediction. \nRussia will be shifting its economic focus away from the West and more to Asia and the emerging economies in the Middle East and Africa. And what the West should be worried about is the growing ties between Russia and China and their mutual desire to establish a financial system independent from the West, and the dethronement of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency.",
