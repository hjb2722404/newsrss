The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

In exchange, it expects that the Kremlin won't escalate the war beyond Ukraine or resort to the use of nuclear weapons. \nAmerica's stance is under threat because the near-mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group, raises the question as to whether Moscow has run out of options.\n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: Newsweek is only confirming what everyone knows.
