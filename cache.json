Members of parliament resisted attempts to extend this requirement to them, and the Kenyan High Court ruled in their favour.  \nIt’s not just politicians that are under pressure to produce qualifications. Many public servants have used fake degrees in pursuit of job opportunities or promotions. One case involved a man who posed as a high-ranking police officer for over 10 years.

The government has urged wage restraint to avoid an inflationary spiral.\nUnions formed picket lines around rail stations for the second day this week and warned of more industrial action unless a deal can be reached to improve pay and avoid redundancies.\n\"We'll continue to talk to the companies about everything that's been put on the table and we'll review that and see if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action,\" Mick Lynch, secretary-general of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), told the BBC.\n\"But if we don't get a settlement, it's extremely likely that there will be.\"\nAlthough talks are ongoing, a third day of strikes is planned for Saturday. Other industries are also moving towards industrial action in what unions say could be a \"summer of discontent\".\nThe government has criticized the strikes, calling them counterproductive and most damaging for those on low incomes who depend on public transport and are unable to work from home.\nLater on Thursday, ministers will set out planned changes to a law that would make it easier for businesses to use temporary staff, in a moved designed to minimize the impact of strike action.\n\n\"Once again trade unions are holding the country to ransom by grinding crucial public services and businesses to a halt. The situation we are in is not sustainable,\" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said.\n\"Repealing these 1970s-era restrictions will give businesses freedom to access fully skilled staff at speed, all while allowing people to get on with their lives uninterrupted to help keep the economy ticking.\"\n(REUTERS)",

The Fox Corp chairman and his former supermodel wife were frequent fodder for the tabloids, which chronicled their marriage at Spencer House and the festivities surrounding the elder Murdoch's 90th birthday celebration last year at Tavern on the Green in New York City.\nMurdoch's divorce, his fourth, is unlikely to alter the ownership structure of businesses he holds stakes in, which include Fox Corp, the parent company of Fox News Channel, and News Corp publisher of the Wall Street Journal, according to the report.\nThe Murdoch family's shares in the companies he founded reside in a strictly managed trust.\nBryce Tom, a spokesperson for Murdoch, declined to comment. A representative for Hall did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.\n(Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru and Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)",

          "description": "A new Granite State poll of likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire signals waning support for former President Donald J. Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee — and growing strength for Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida.\nAmong more than 300 likely Republican primary voters, 37% said they wanted Mr. Trump to be the party’s next presidential nominee, compared with 39% who said they would support Mr. DeSantis, within the margin of error of 5.5% for this question.  Mr. Trump is now “statistically linked” to Mr. DeSantis, according to the poll.\nThat’s a significant change from October, when a Granite State poll showed Mr. Trump had the support of 43% of likely Republican voters;  Mr. DeSantis was at 18%.\n\n\nBut Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted the poll, warned there was still plenty of time before the 2024 presidential cycle: “It’s daylight saving time.  We haven’t even had the midterm elections yet.\n\n\nThe tightening between Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis is “part of a typical pattern,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.  “As the primary draws closer, new candidates are emerging and attracting more media attention, and therefore more voter attention, than the losing candidate from the previous election.”\nThe survey was conducted from June 16 to 20.  It also showed that among more than 840 likely voters in the 2024 general election, Mr. DeSantis was a stronger Republican challenger than Mr. Trump to face President Biden in the next presidential election.\nMr. Biden, who won the state in 2020, would get 50% of the vote if he ran against Mr. Trump, who would get 43%, according to the poll.  But Mr. Biden was only expected to get 46% against Mr. DeSantis, who would get 47%, according to the poll.\nIn a brief interview, Mr. Smith described waning support for Mr. Trump as voters “move away from last year’s model to look at this year’s model”.\n\nSource Link",

Morris believes the leak “must have undoubtedly come from the Biden forces.” \nFurther, Morris says that he’s heard rumors close to the White House that Biden’s dementia is getting worse and has become harder to control and cover up. \n“I believe there may be a move coming to invoke the 25th Amendment against Biden and replace him with Harris,” Morris writes. “Biden’s people are pushing back against it by shooting at Harris and saying that she’s not really ready to be president.”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I must admit that I am surprised that President Biden is still in office. I always watch and listen to his speeches and announcements, and I predicted last year that if his loss of cognitive abilities continue, he would be replaced in 2022.

I have my doubts that it will work that way..\nMy guess is that it will be the people who convinced candidate Biden and his staff to appoint Kamala Harris as his running mate in 2020 that will lay the groundwork for President Biden to leave, and it will be the people around President Biden as well as the leadership in the Democrat Party who will then finally tell him that his time is up.",
