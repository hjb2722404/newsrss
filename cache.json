          "description": "One year ago this Saturday, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died after being arrested by Iranâs morality police for wearing her hijab \"improperly\". Her death led to massive anti-regime protests, known by their now-iconic slogan: âWoman, Life, Freedomâ. The Observers team has been in regular contact with dozens of women across Iran over the past 12 months. Many of them have told us that it has become the ânew normalâ for millions of women in Iran to go out in public with their hair uncovered. But with a new law under discussion that would massively increase the penalties for hijab-related offenses, how long will these new freedoms last?",

Â \nDuring Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q. Brown's speech at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's mega conference outside of Washington, D.C., the soon-to-be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs dropped two new images of the B-21 Raider. While the stealth bomber was rolled out in December of last year, it remains cloaked in secrecy. Brown, the top Air Force uniformed officer, didn't specifically reference the images in his presentation.Â \nUp until today, only one angle of the full aircraft has been seen by the public â head-on â and in a very controlled environment at the bomber's unveiling. Aside from a close-up of the cockpit area at an angle, all imagery published since then has been from the same head-on perspective, although it has progressively shown the aircraft in more detail. Now we have our first quartering view of the flying-wing jet, which provides significant details about its design. A new head-on image also gives us a better idea of the bomber's actual size. Both images were taken at Northrop Grumman's facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. \n\nÂ \nRead more ....Â \nNew Images Emerge Of The B-21\n\nÂ \nCSAF Shows Off New Images of the B-21; Raider Begins Engine Runs -- Air & Space ForcesÂ \nB-21 Raider stealth bomber: New images show US Air Forceâs Â£585m cutting-edge aircraft -- The Independent\nÂ \nNew B-21 photos released, as engine runs begin -- Breaking Defense\nÂ \nNew Photos Offer Rare Glimpse at US' Classified B-21 Stealth Bomber -- Sputnik",
