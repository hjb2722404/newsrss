          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r ¬†\r \r Thanks to the rise of smartphones and mobile technology, consumers are increasing their use of digital payment acceptance methods such as credit cards, mobile payment apps, and other forms of contactless payment methods to pay for everything, from big-ticket items to groceries and bus fares. It is more important than ever for small businesses to ensure they are not falling behind on the cashless trend.\r \r Over the past two years, the pandemic has accelerated this transformation, with Hong Kong seeing its largest drop in cash usage. The switch was most noticeable between 2019 and 2020 during the initial wave of the pandemic, according to a study on consumer payment attitudes carried out by Visa, a world-leading payment network.\r \r As more and more consumers demand cashless operations, the demand for small and micro businesses (SMBs) to support digital payments has also increased. Many of these SMBs are eager to adopt digital payment methods, and many now understand the benefits to their business when providing this option for customers.¬†\r \r \"Setting up a point-of-sale terminal seemed daunting at first when we considered accepting digital payments,\" says Koyi Chan, owner of flower shop Botanic Union. \"But it turned out to be less of a hassle than expected.\"¬†\r \r \"Allowing our customers to pay digitally has had a huge impact on our business, especially during the Christmas season when people shop for Christmas trees and flowers at our shop and on our website. With customers being able to make transactions with just a tap, they'll feel secure and more inclined to spend more money,‚Äù she says.¬†\r \r \r \r Like Botanic Union, two in five small businesses in Hong Kong agree that accepting digital and contactless payments is among the top investment areas needed to meet customer expectations, according to ‚ÄòThe Visa Back to Business Study‚Äô.\r \r Turning your mobile device into a POS terminal\r \r Carpenter Ng, 48, a driver with taxi service provider Chung Shing Taxi, has adopted Visa's ‚ÄòTap to Phone‚Äô‚Ä¶",

Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.\nThe move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday's session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.\nThey were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.\nAnother deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the \"special military operation\". He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.\n\"Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies,\" Svintsov said.\n(Reported by Filipp Lebedev; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)",

Nuclear weapons without any cohesion,\" Biden said, according to a White House transcript.\nPakistan -- proud to be the only declared nuclear power in the Islamic world -- summoned US Ambassador Donald Blome to lodge a protest.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that Pakistan was a \"responsible nuclear state\" and that it takes safety measures \"with the utmost seriousness.\"\nUS officials have long privately voiced alarm about nuclear safety if the political situation changes in Pakistan, whose military and intelligence apparatus has assisted Afghanistan's Taliban.\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Biden's remarks should not hurt relations, noting that the president was not speaking at an official function.\nBut Bhutto Zardari, who recently visited Washington, called for more interaction, with Biden showing little interest in personally engaging his Pakistani counterparts.\nPatel noted, however, that USAID chief Samantha Power and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet have both visited since devastating floods hit Pakistan.\n\"This is a relationship we view as important and it's something that we're going to continue to remain deeply engaged in,\" he said.",
