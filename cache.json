Mark Milley.\nNow, other conservatives are joining Milley in criticizing the former president.\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nRetired Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe said the incident reminds him \"of the time Trump mocked a reporter with a physical disability and a speech impediment.\"\n\"Or when he dissed Senator McCain for having been captured in war and having endured torture,\" Tribe added. \"Who revels in such cruelty? The Man Who Would Be King, that's who. No thank you!\"\nConservative attorney and anti-Trump activist George Conway answered Tribe's question, saying, \"Who is such a person? A malignant narcissist—a soulless, conscienceless, and morally bereft individual relentlessly driven by pathological levels of narcissism, sociopathy, sadism, and Machiavellinism.\"\nIn a separate post, Conway wrote, \"There is no nice way to put it. P01135809 is pure scum,\" referring to Trump's assigned booking number from his recent arrest in Georgia.\nFormer GOP campaign consultant Rick Wilson also said, \"Trump's loathing for an injured war hero speaks more volumes about his low, repulsive character than almost any of the other stories of his public or private behavior. I've read damn near every account of his degenerate, foul life, and this one still shocks.\"\nFormer Trump supporter David Weissman on Thursday added, \"Trump continues to show his distain of American war heroes.

          "description": "BBC News: How Norway outstrips US on Ukraine spending \nThe United States has poured more than a hundred billion dollars into Ukraine's effort to repel Russia's invasion, spending far more than any other nation. \nBut as President Volodymyr Zelensky comes to Washington to ask for more, there is growing Republican scepticism about funding the war effort. \n In his Tuesday speech to the UN, Joe Biden made a passionate plea for the global community to not turn its back on Ukraine. \n\"Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence,\" he said.\n\"But I ask you this: If we abandon the core principles of the United States to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they're protected?\" \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The Ukraine sources that I trust are telling me that over half of this aid is now being lost due to corruption. It is almost as if everyone has come to the same realization that aid from the West is not going to be forthcoming as it has been in the past, and now is the best time to grab what you can before the spigot is turned off. \nI can speak personally on how rotten this corruption is. I am part of a group that helps to send needed drugs and medicines to Ukraine. Specifically it goes to my father's home town that is south of Kyiv. We always had some losses, but our last three shipments of vital supplies just disappeared.",
