So, lots of people were killed doing the stadiums. Yes, the stadiums are extraordinary, but at a great price.

In the previous decades, they had expressed their rivalries by creating two sets of alliances whose strategies had become linked by their respective schedules for mobilisation. As a result, in 1914, the murder of the Austrian Crown Prince in Sarajevo, Bosnia by a Serb nationalist was allowed to escalate into a general war that began when Germany executed its all-purpose plan to defeat France by attacking neutral Belgium at the other end of Europe. \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: It’s time for a negotiated peace in Ukraine, Kissinger says (CNBC/Reuters)  \nUpdate #2: Kissinger: It's Time For Negotiated Peace In Ukraine To Avoid World War (Zero Hedge)  \nUpdate #3: Kissinger says it’s time to resolve conflict in Ukraine through talks (TASS)   \nWNU Editor: The critics are speaking out: \n\nMy takedown of Kissinger's delusionally nostalgic \"peace plan\" for Ukraine. https://t.co/FoFHX7z0cQ\n— Fred Kaplan (@fmkaplan) December 16, 2022",

Instead, it seems the British media are not only critical that this report is being done (parroting what the Whitehall leaker has said), but they are also deeply concerned that this report may result in a lessening of support for Ukraine.\nWhen did Whitehall (i.e. the bureaucracy) decide what UK policy was to be?

That’s 10 percentage points less than in 2020, but is still the second-highest reading in history. \nThe data show how many countries are still reeling from the consequences of the pandemic: debt shot up in 2020 because of the economic recession, and so did deficits as governments extended financial help to individuals and businesses. As economies opened up, inflation set in as supply couldn’t meet demand, while food and energy costs rose because of war and climate pressures.   \nRead more ..... \nWNU Editor: These numbers are already out of date.
