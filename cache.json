New England’s roads are in constant need of repair and repaving, we have aging infrastructure and we need to meet the needs of our growing city and respond with better features for pedestrians and cyclists.\nTake a spin on Maple Street or the Glendale Street Bridge and you can see some needed improvements for yourself.

And now you can own his house in Manhattan.\nFamous physician Dr Drew, otherwise known as Drew Pinsky, is offering its Upper West Side penthouse for $1.59 million, Gimme Shelter has learned.  The move comes more than four years after Pinsky and his wife, Susan, started renting the 215 W. 95th St. condo with an asking price of $5,900 per month, as we reported at the time.\nThe Pinskys have owned this two-bedroom, two-bathroom building for about 10 years, having bought it for $1.45 million.

But after Putin's announcement early today that he had ordered a partial mobilization, all that I have been hearing from the leaders of NATO and countries that border Russia is nothing but rhetoric denouncing this move (see above video). \nNo calls to match Russia's partial mobilization. No calls to even declare a partial wartime industrial mobilization. Even Ukraine is silent on matching this Russian mobilization.\n\nYou can take this to the bank. \nIf the West does nothing in the coming days to say that they will match Russia's mobilization efforts, this is going to cause panic in Ukraine that the West is now abandoning them. And in the eyes of the Kremlin, another example on how weak and ineffective the West has become. \nMy prediction. \nThe West (primarily the U.S.) will announce more troop deployments to eastern Europe, and more aid to Ukraine in the coming days. But it will fall short from what Ukraine needs, and it will certainly not match what Russia is going to do.",

At the same time, China’s LNG exports have increased, in part to offset the economic effects of Omicron-driven lockdowns.   \nAccording to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), which viewed the data, the value of LNG coming to China from Russia via pipelines in the first eight months of 2022 was nearly triple that seen in the previous year, amounting to $2.39 billion. In terms of volume, China’s overall LNG imports from Russia increased by 28.5% year-on-year; for imports from Qatar, they increased by 66.7%, or two-thirds.  \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It is always about the money. \nChina's Traders Are Making A Killing Selling Russian Energy Products To Countries That Have Sanctioned Russian Energy Products   \nChina is benefitting from LNG sales to Europe as some traders resell non-Russian cargoes at high prices while restocking with cheap Russian fuel -- Insider  \nChina’s Energy Giants Sell Gas to World Scrambling for Supply -- Bloomberg  \nChina Is Quietly Reselling Its Excess Russian LNG To Europe -- OilPrice.com",
