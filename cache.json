The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court's powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.\nAs the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.\n\"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids,\" said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.\nThe protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.\nNational police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.\nThe now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and \"will not yield to any political pressure on the matter\".\nNetanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.\n\"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister',\" said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.\n(Writing by Dan Williams; editing by John Stonestreet)",

The country stands for evil, he said. \"It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment.\"\nZelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.",

If Xi Jinping chooses to \"befriend a war criminal, it is our duty to get very serious about China,\" Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, told DW when asked what he thought about the Chinese president's three-day visit to Moscow and his meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. \nThe International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin late last week, accusing him of war crimes.  The only way forward for the European Union now, Landsbergis said, is to take \"first steps on de-risking and eventual decoupling from China. The sooner we start, the better for the union.\"   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: China's Russia ties after Xi visit to Moscow loom large as EU leaders gather for Brussels summit (SCMP)  \nUpdate #2: China’s liaisons with Russia are fueling an awkward split among European leaders (CNBC)   \nWNU Editor: EU sanctions on Russia has caused serious economic damage to the EU.

Pompeo said the Biden foreign policy has failed, as Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin strengthen ties against the West. \nChinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an agreement to expand their economic ties during a bilateral meeting in Moscow on Tuesday. \nXi arrived in Moscow for a multiday series of meetings with his Russian counterpart, aimed at demonstrating the two countries' new \"friendship without limits.\" Xi and Putin emphasized the importance of jointly safeguarding their countries' energy security.
