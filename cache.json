With just the sun and a solar panel, a theater can be set up in areas where people struggle to access food and water and make a decent living. But what it truly requires is the courage to not view creativity as a luxury.

The prosecutor sought to link favors done for the officials with Bankman-Fried's decision to allow FTX customers in the Bahamas to withdraw funds after withdrawals for others had been halted. Bankman-Fried, who is facing charges of fraud and conspiracy, denied offering to pay off the Bahamas' national debt but admitted to offering a job to the son of the Bahamian prime minister. He also stated that he could not recall whether he gave the prime minister and his wife seats at a Miami Heat game.",

          "description": "A new poll shows that President Joe Biden's support among Arab Americans has dropped significantly, from 59% in 2020 to just 17% now. This decline in support is attributed to growing anger over Biden's support for Israel's attacks on Gaza. The poll also reveals that a majority of Arab Americans no longer identify as Democrats, with 32% identifying as Republicans and 31% as independents. The poll highlights the challenge Biden may face in winning over key Arab American voters.",

By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

It turns out, however, that the video of the injured man is from August 2023, months before the war broke out. Moreover, it shows another man – and a real victim of the ongoing conflict.",

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for her attendance of a protest opposing the war in Gaza. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\n\"List of feckless Republicans that voted WITH Democrats to table my censure resolution against Rashida Tlaib,\" Greene said on Wednesday. \"This is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!! PATHETIC.\"\n\nShe created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. \nThey include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. \n\n\tEarlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.\n\"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger,\" she said. \"And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate.\"\nThe media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.\n\"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib,\" tweeted Chat Pergram.\nMelanie Zanona also tweeted: \"motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans.\"\n\nAnd CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: \"House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems. MTG offered the resolution.\"",

Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. \nCapitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.\nAfter a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). \nThe news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",

(Hamas.ps)\n\n \n\nTimes of Israel: Far from Gaza hardships, Hamas chief and family enjoy easy life in Qatar\n\n \nThanks to Doha’s sponsorship and the wealth he accumulated as Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh and his children today live a life of wealth and privileges denied to other Gazans \nShortly after the start of Hamas’s brutal attack against Israel on October 7, a video began circulating of the terror group’s leader Ismail Haniyeh in his elegant office in the Qatari capital Doha, watching the bloody onslaught unfold on Al Jazeera and “prostrating in gratitude” with a group of other Hamas officials for the killing of over 1,300 Israelis, among them at least 1,000 civilians.\nFor years, Haniyeh has been rebuked by many Palestinians for leading a comfortable life away from the hardships of Gaza in the oil-rich Gulf monarchy, which offers shelter to the terror group’s leaders and an internationally recognized platform to spread its propaganda through Al Jazeera.\n\n \nRead more .... \n WNU Editor: Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh is not the only leader leader who is protected and far away from the war that he has helped to ignite. Almost all of the world's leaders are protected and immune from the policies and strategies that they implement.",

I have a hard time finding anything wrong with that.\" pic.twitter.com/24janX3kbr\n— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 22, 2023\n  \nThe Federalist: No Mitch McConnell, Ukraine Aid Is Not ‘Rebuilding Our Industrial Base’ \nSenate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to reassure Ukrainian aid skeptics that billions in foreign assistance is being spent on American manufacturers to build weapons at home. \n“If you look at the Ukraine assistance,” McConnell said on CBS, “a significant portion of what’s being spent in the United States and 38 different states, replacing the weapons that we send to Ukraine with more modern weapons, so we’re rebuilding our industrial base.” \nBut a closer examination of the aid for Ukraine reveals an overwhelming majority of taxpayer dollars are going overseas. Just a fraction of the $113 billion spent has gone to “rebuilding our industrial base.”\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Defense spending always boosts the economy, but after the stimulus it is always followed by inflation and economic contraction.

China’s Air Force is mainly copies of the same Russian planes that are getting wrecked in the Ukraine. \nThe US military has no interest in telling everyone how pathetic the Russian and Chinese Air Force is.
