          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r NTK Academic Group’s Achievement on IBDP Tuition\r \r As students approach the IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme) or other final school exams which pave the way to further education, most can benefit from extra tuition to help them navigate through the confusion of syllabus changes and stricter marking schemes.\r \r Typically, these sessions cover all the key aspects of the relevant curriculum, elucidating and reinforcing as and where necessary. But ideally, they will also do more by providing insights and practical tips on everything from study techniques and essay writing to exam strategies, time management and independent learning skills in order for students to achieve the best possible results. \r \r \r \r “Our courses give students a stronger academic foundation and help them develop the skills they need to succeed in higher education and beyond,” says Mr T. K. Eric Ng, Founder of NTK Academic Group, which has been operating in Hong Kong for almost 28 years. “We can create individualised learning plans based on each student’s academic needs and targets. These plans outline specific goals to work towards and progress is regularly assessed.” \r \r NTK’s teachers, many of whom have advanced degrees from renowned universities like Oxford, Cambridge and the Ivy League, are among the best in their fields. This ensures that students receive high-quality instruction and support from a knowledgeable and experienced team.\r \r A wide range of subjects is on offer, not just for the IBDP curriculum, but also for the IGCSE, GCE A-Levels and the standardised university admissions tests often required of candidates applying from international schools and boarding schools. \r \r As a result, NTK has helped more than 80 students achieve full scores (a total of 45 marks) in the IBDP over the past three years, with a further 200 getting a 7 in various subjects. \r \r \r \r “Whether for group courses using proprietary materials developed by IBDP…",

By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

I don’t think about it.” \nWhile it’s a question Zelenskyy understandably isn’t eager to contemplate, it’s also one his supporters at home and abroad can’t afford to ignore. Ever since he rebuffed an evacuation offer by telling his would-be American rescuers “I need ammunition, not a ride,” the Ukrainian president has played a key role in mustering international support for the fight against Russia. \n Read more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: If I was responsible for Zelensky's personal security, I would be worried about a Russian missile strike, but I would also be worried on what the hard-line elements in the Ukraine government or military would do if this war grinds on, and Zelensky is put in a position where he must make a compromised deal with Putin. \nThere are elements within his government who want nothing less than the complete expulsion of the Russian military and the eradication of the Russian language and culture within the country. There is no compromise with these people, and I have no idea on how Zelensky will be able to placate them or even if he wants to. \nOne more note.\n\nIf Zelensky is assassinated, the person who will replace him is Ukraine’s Parliament chairman Ruslan Stefanchuk.I do not know much about this politician, but I do know that some of my Ukrainian family, friends, and contacts do not trust him.",

Nevertheless, progress on the ground has been slow, raising the prospects of a protracted war. \nThis begs the question: Just how much longer could the war last? \nThe precedent of prior wars is one way of looking at the issue.

The PLA Navy has deployed more ships in the region than ever in the last decade. However, the US Pacific fleet Commander is optimistic about the US Navy’s readiness. \nThe US Pacific fleet Commander recently admitted that one thing that has changed about the Western Pacific in the last four decades is that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has gone from building a fleet of about 37 vessels in the early 2000s to over 350 now. \nPreviously, with an increase in China’s fleet size, Pentagon officials warned that China is a “pacing threat” to the US military and indicated that the US military could not keep up with China’s rapid naval development.

Some of Germany's biggest companies have begun to ditch the fatherland, triggering fears of deindustrialization.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: I have a few friends in Germany. They cannot believe what is happening to their country. The German economy is being de-industrialized in front of everyone's eyes. And now this .... Germany expected to be only major economy not to grow this year (Euronews/AP). \nIt should be noted that there was a time when Robert Habeck, one of two co-leaders of the Greens, was the most popular politician in Germany (link here). Is he still the most popular politician in Germany? Not if this economic disaster continues.\n\n \nUpdate: The Duran were the first to talk about the de-industrialization of Germany. Their analysis (below) on where this is leading to is a must see.",
