But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

At the time of the alleged assaults, Brand was a presenter for BBC Radio 2, Channel 4, and an actor in Hollywood films. Other claims made as part of the investigation include allegations about Brand's controlling, abusive and predatory behaviour.\"\nLate Friday night, Brand took to his social media platforms to defend himself, claiming his liaisons were all \"consensual.\"\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\n\nThe BBC reported that Brand claimed, \"Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.\"\nHe continued, \"These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies, and as I've written about extensively in my books I was very, very promiscuous. Now during that time of promiscuity the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual.\"\nALSO IN THE NEWS: 'He’s probably guilty, but it doesn’t matter': Trump fans aren't scared off by 4 criminal indictments\n\nThe report adds Brand added he believes he's the victim of as a \"co-ordinated attack\" and will be looking into the \"very, very serious\" allegations.\nYou can read more here.",

It is almost as if everyone has come to the same realization that aid from the West is not going to be forthcoming as it has been in the past, and now is the best time to grab what you can before the spigot is turned off. \nI can speak personally on how rotten this corruption is. I am part of a group that helps to send needed drugs and medicines to Ukraine. Specifically it goes to my father's home town that is south of Kyiv. We always had some losses, but our last three shipments of vital supplies just disappeared.",

          "description": "The Atlantic: Ukraine Isn’t the Reason the U.S. Is Unprepared for War \nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the United States has provided Kyiv with more than $43 billion worth of security assistance. Opponents of aid to Ukraine have argued that the United States is drawing down inventories of systems and ammunition that are already in short supply for its own forces, and which would be needed in any high-intensity conflict. \nOur country could very well lose a large-scale war for lack of weapons and ammunition—but not because of aid to Ukraine. In a major conflict, the U.S. would run out of munitions in a few weeks, and in less than a week for some crucial categories. The quantity of weapons we are providing Ukraine is marginal compared with necessary weapons that we have not stocked. As Mackenzie Eaglen of the American Enterprise Institute has argued, “Over the past nine fiscal years, budget after budget has traded away combat power, truncated needed weapons early, and permanently closed production lines.”\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: You have to wonder where is all that defense money going?",

They said that the real Chinese military budget is probably closer to about $700 billion. \nAnd we are supposed to cut the defense budget at one of the most dangerous times since World War II?? pic.twitter.com/rohCKOTfEa\n— Sen. Dan Sullivan (@SenDanSullivan) June 1, 2023\n  \nForeign Policy: China’s Defense Budget Is Much Bigger Than It Looks\n\n \nThe actual number could be more than double the current Western estimate. \nU.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan recently revealed that U.S. government estimates put the Chinese annual defense budget at around $700 billion. That is far higher than previous estimates and almost on par with the United States’ 2023 defense budget of just over $800 billion. \nSullivan’s number stands in stark contrast to other estimates of Chinese defense spending. One of the most respected independent sources of defense data, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, pegs China’s military budget for 2022 at only about $290 billion. The new, much higher number also completely contradicts the widespread assertion that U.S. defense spending is so lavish that it amounts to more than that of the next 10 countries put together.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: China’s Military Spending Is Much Bigger Than We Thought (Bloomberg)\n\n \nWNU Editor: I even think this $700 billion is a low-ball estimate.

The data compiled by the Office of Naval Intelligence says that a growing gap in fleet sizes is being helped by China's shipbuilders being more than 200 times more capable of producing surface warships and submarines. This underscores longstanding concerns about the U.S. Navy's ability to challenge Chinese fleets, as well as sustain its forces afloat, in any future high-end conflict. \nIn a statement to The War Zone, the U.S. Navy has confirmed the authenticity of the slide, seen in full below, which has been circulating online. \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: China is also surpassing the US military in other areas ....
