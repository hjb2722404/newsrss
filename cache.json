As the BBC points out, Antov's death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov's friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have \"consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.\"\nAntov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. \nFrom the BBC: \"Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov's account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: 'It's extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.' The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a 'patriot of my country' and backed the war.\"\nRead the full report over at the BBC.",

While forward, operators frequently encounter lose / lose situations that the community isn't preparing them to solve.  This increases the risk of mission failure and damage to the reputation of the SOCOM community as a whole.  In part, the problem stems from the difficulty of the situations themselves, but the problem is aggravated by the community's treatment of ethics training as an individual task, when it isn’t.  Ethics training is a collective task, and it requires as much training as any other special operations skill set.  Grey Zone Ethics provides an accessible and realistic solution to this problem. \nDave Maxwell\nThu, 01/05/2023 - 6:34pm\n\nRead more about New Publication: Grey Zone Ethics: A Practitioners Guide to Making Ethically Difficult Decisions\nLog in or register to post comments",

The issue is complex and some parts of the ruling coalition are more ardent than others, according to people familiar with the discussions. \nThe internal tensions reflect the international community’s broader struggle to forge a common position. If Berlin can resolve its own issues, it could provide fresh momentum for discussions in the European Union and put pressure on the US to seize assets, such as central bank reserves, that have been frozen in retaliation over Russia’s invasion.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate 1: Berlin carefully backs Ukrainian demand to use frozen Russian funds (Euractiv)  \nUpdate #2: Germany open to seize Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine — media reports (The New Voice of Ukraine)   \nWNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction.
