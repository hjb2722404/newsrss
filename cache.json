          "description": "For half a century, during the Cold War, every U-S president painted Russia as the dominant threat. America's ideological opposite, a hostile and nuclear-armed power. Ronald Reagan went so far as to call the Soviet Union an Evil Empire.\nSo the events of recent days have been noteworthy. On top of a holdup of U-S aid for Ukraine, former President Trump said he might NOT come to the defense of a NATO ally who hadn't spent enough on defense.\nAnd Tucker Carlson, the erstwhile Fox news host, flew to Moscow to sit down with Vladimir Putin for more than two hours of mostly softball questions. \nAfterward, he pronounced Putin \"impressive\" on stage at the World Government Summit.\nSo what gives? Why the romance between the American right and Russia?\nFor sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.  \nEmail us at considerthis@npr.org.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

But this has been repeatedly debunked; Biden was acting in line with U.S. policy, Shokin was not planning to investigate Burisma, and international observers had accused him of corruption.\nPer the DOJ statement, FBI officials became suspicious in part because Smirnov changed his story and provided different details when questioned at a later date.\nThis comes after a number of other failed Republican allegations against the Bidens, including a series of payments the younger Biden made to his father that turned out just to be repaying loans for a truck.",

The second woman was arrested inside.\n\"It was a surprise operation for them as part of the day of love,\" the disguised officer later told AFP.\nPolice said the women, a mother and daughter, were part of a gang called \"the drug cheats\", and sold cocaine paste and marijuana from their home in northern Lima.\nHundreds of packages of drugs were seized at the location.\nPeruvian police have become adept at disguises and operations launched on special dates to try to deceive and trap criminals.\nThe officers \"disguised themselves using the teddy bear because drugs were sold there,\" Colonel Walter Palomino, head of the Green Squadron of the National Police, told AFP.\nPeru is one of the world's biggest cocaine producers, yielding some 400 tonnes per year, according to official figures.\nIn 2023, authorities seized 21.5 tonnes of cocaine and dismantled 119 criminal networks linked to drug trafficking, according to the interior ministry.\n© 2024 AFP",

          "description": "Spanish farmers kept up their protests over the sector's troubles on Thursday, with tractors parked outside of the agriculture ministry in central Madrid before a meeting with Agriculture Minister Luis Planas.\nFarmers slowly drove around 15 tractors, some decorated with Spanish flags, to the building which sits across the street from Madrid's busy Atocha train station, snarling traffic.\nOnce there they parked and unfurled banners that read \"Farmers on a war path\" and \"Planas, the ruin of the countryside\".\nAround 250 farmers and agricultural union representatives gathered in the rain ahead of the meeting. Most had arrived by bus from other regions of Spain.\nPlanas was due to meet with Spain's main agricultural unions, Asaja, COAG and UPA, later on Thursday, a day after he met with the major players in the food supply chain\nFarmers on Wednesday blocked roads across the country, especially in the south where they disrupted the first stage of a cycling race and in the northeastern region of Catalonia where they blocked parts of the AP-7 highway linking Spain and France.\nAngry farmers have been protesting across Europe over rising costs, high fuel prices, bureaucracy and the environmental requirements in the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its forthcoming \"Green Deal\".\nSpanish farmers are also protesting low prices for their produce and the lack of financial aid to the sector.\nThe unions are planning a huge rally in front of the agriculture ministry on February 21, and will rally again in Madrid on February 26 to coincide with the meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Brussels.\nOften referred to as Europe's vegetable garden, Spain is one of the bloc's leading producers of salad, fruit and vegetables but its farms have suffered from a long-running drought in the Iberian Peninsula for the past three years.\n© 2024 AFP",

          "description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a test of new surface-to-sea missiles and warned that the country would take a more aggressive military posture in disputed sea boundaries with war-divided rival South Korea, the North’s state media said Thursday.\nThe report by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea's military said it detected the North firing multiple cruise missiles in waters off its eastern port of Wonsan. The test, the North’s sixth missile launch event of 2024, added to a provocative run in weapons demonstrations since 2022 that escalated tensions to the highest point in years.\nSome experts say Kim may seek to further dial up pressure in an election year in South Korea and the United States. There are growing concerns in South Korea about a direct military provocation and a possible area of conflict could be the Koreas’ poorly drawn western sea boundary, which has been the site of several bloody skirmishes in past years.\nKim supervised the test launches of the missiles he described as key weapons for his navy. He also accused South Korea of frequently violating what he decried as North Korean territorial waters with its maritime patrols and interdiction of third-party ships. He ordered his navy to strengthen its defense posture in waters near the South Korean border islands of Baekryeong and Yeonpyeong, where a North Korean artillery bombardment killed four people in 2010.\n(AP)",

          "description": "A Texas showdown on Twitter/X had Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) trading fire with scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton. \nThe first shot came from Michael Quinn Sullivan who called out the senator for failing to protect the Southern Border. \nHis tweet reads: \"While Texans slept, @JohnCornyn sent $95 billion to help other countries with their border problems. Question: when was the last time Cornyn stayed up all night fighting for our border?\"\nALSO READ: How Donald Trump is spreading a dangerous mental illness to his supporters\nPaxton piled on. \n\"This is a question all Texans should be asking,\" according to his reply. \"Unbelievable that @JohnCornyn would stay up all night to defend other countries borders, but not America.\"\nSo that had Cornyn landing a counterpunch. \"Ken, your criminal defense lawyers are calling to suggest you spend less time pushing Russian propaganda and more time defending longstanding felony charges against you in Houston, as well as ongoing federal grand jury proceedings in San Antonio that will probably result in further criminal charges,\" according to the tweet. \nPaxton faced an impeachment effort stemming from a whistleblower lawsuit filed by four former senior employees claiming they were wrongfully terminated. \nThey accused Paxton of axing them from their posts after reporting his suspected corruption to the FBI.\nThose allegations eventually led to a Paxton impeachment vote on alleged bribery and abuse of office charges. \nHe managed to get acquitted after a trial in the Senate.\nHowever, the whistleblower lawsuit reportedly remains pending.",

However, after the GOP won control of the House in 2022, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rescinded this policy.\nThe impeachment of Mayorkas, in which Republicans have remained vague about what high crimes or misdemeanors they are actually accusing him of, is expected to fail at trial in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
