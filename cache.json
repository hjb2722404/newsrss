The measure is believed to be aimed at reducing migration, particularly to Nicaragua, a transit point for migrants from Haiti, Cuba, and Africa trying to reach the US.

Berkovich and fellow playwright Svetlana Petriychuk were arrested on charges of \"justifying terrorism\" for their play about Russian women recruited into the Islamic State. The case has raised controversy as the charges are based on a fringe research method called \"destructology\" that has been dismissed as pseudoscience.",

Cohen snapped at the well-dressed middle-aged woman, wearing sunglasses and a beige trench coat and holding a tote bag, shows video obtained by The Post,\" the Post wrote. \"This is illegal. Turn it on yourself, freak. You should be in jail,” the woman shot back, according to the news report.\nThe woman appeared to be confused about who Cohen was, according to the Post's account.\n\"She also appeared to confuse him with hedge fund billionaire and Mets owner Steve Cohen,\" it reported. \"When Michael Cohen demanded the woman’s name, she said it was 'Steve Cohen and I should be back in jail because I’m a piece of s—t.'\"\nCohen himself had this to say about the encounter:\n\"When reached by The Post, Michael Cohen said he wanted to get the woman’s name and hold her accountable,\" according to the Post's report. \"While walking on Park Avenue at the corner of 61st street, I was shocked to see this racist, antisemitic curmudgeon tearing the face off the missing-child poster and laughing about it.

He also took numerous shots at the retired general named Mark Milley, who said he had to restrain the former president's worst impulses throughout his time in office.\nTrump mentioned Milley alongside secretary of defense James Mattis.\n\"You know Mattis. General Mattis. General Milley. Real beauties,\" Trump said on stage on Saturday.\n\"General Milley is the one who decided to take the soldiers out first,\" he added. \"General Milley is the one that said let's leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind because it's cheaper than taking it out. It's cheaper than putting a tank of nice, clean fuel in the airplane and flying it to Pakistan or flying it all the way home. It's cheaper to leave it there.\"\nHe claimed 700,000 rifles, 70,000 vehicles, and more were left behind after war.\nThe ex-president added, \"We have an unbelievable military. We just have some really bad leaders.\"",

Strickland,\" the Vatican said in a statement.\nIt said the bishop of Austin, Joe Vasquez, had been named as apostolic administrator of the diocese, but gave no further details.\nThe Vatican has not said what sparked the apostolic visitation this summer -- which Strickland himself made public -- or what conclusions were drawn.\nBut Strickland, appointed by former pope Benedict XVI in 2012, was one of the most prominent critics of Pope Francis.\nThe Argentine pope, 86, has sought to forge a more compassionate Church, open to different views.\nBut he has faced intense opposition from critics -- particularly in the United States -- who accused him of causing confusion and failing to uphold key Catholic beliefs.\nIn a message earlier this year on X, formerly Twitter, Strickland accused the pope of \"undermining the deposit of faith\".\nIn a blog posted on his website in September, the bishop addressed rumours that he was being encouraged by the Vatican to step down.\n\"I cannot resign as bishop of Tyler because that would be me abandoning the flock\" under his care, he wrote.\n\"I have also said that I will respect the authority of Pope Francis if he removes me from office as Bishop of Tyler,\" he wrote.\n\"I love Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church which He established. My only desire is to speak His Truth and live God's Will to the best of my ability,\" he wrote.\nThe diocese of Tyler on Saturday announced the Vatican's decision to dismiss the bishop on its website, saying: \"Our work as the Catholic Church in northeast Texas continues.\"\n© 2023 AFP",

Ron DeSantis (R), who touted his quick action in defense of Israel. \n\"I already acted in Florida,\" DeSantis claimed. \"We deactivated them. We're not going to use state tax dollars to fund jihad. No way. And what is Biden doing?\"\nDeSantis was talking about pro-Hamas student groups in the state. But it turns out it was a lie, according to his own appointee, who sought to expose him for it, reported The Tallahassee Democrat. \nRay Rodrigues, DeSantis' appointee to chancellor of the State University System of Florida, told the paper that the universities found proof that the groups weren't \"subservient or under\" that national organization when they investigated the constitutions of the two chapters of the National Students for J…",
