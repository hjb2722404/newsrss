He was 84 years old.\nThe Cowboys and the University of New Mexico, where Perkins was a standout player before his professional career, announced the death.  No announcement said where he died, and none cited the cause.\nPerkins rushed for 6,217 yards in 107 games with the Cowboys from 1961 to 1968. He is fourth on the team’s career list behind two Pro Football Hall of Famers – Emmitt Smith, the career leader of the NFL, and Tony Dorsett – and the current Cowboys.  running back, Ezekiel Elliott.  Perkins’ 42 rushing touchdowns rank fifth in team history.\n\n\nWhile originally drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the ninth round of the 1960 draft, Perkins had already signed a personal services contract with the expansion Cowboys.  Dallas won its rights after sending the Colts a ninth-round draft pick.\n\n\nPerkins missed the Cowboys’ inaugural season in 1960 with a broken foot.  He ran for 815 yards in 1961 and finished third in voting for NFL Rookie of the Year, behind Mike Ditka and Fran Tarkenton.  He had a career-high 945 rushing yards in 1962.\n\n\nDonald Anthony Perkins was born on March 4, 1938 in Waterloo, Iowa.  He played for New Mexico from 1957 to 1959 and captained the team in its final two seasons.  The Lobos’ coach at the time, future Hall of Famer Marv Levy, said Perkins was one of the greatest players he ever coached.\nPerkins returned to the Albuquerque area after his professional football career ended.  He then worked as a television and radio football analyst.\n\n\nInformation about survivors was not immediately available.\n“Don is one of the greatest Lobos, and certainly one of the greatest football players to play for UNM,” New Mexico athletic director Eddie Nuñez said.  “He came back to New Mexico and worked for the state and was a tremendous ambassador for so many people.”\n\nSource Link",

The Kremlin's coffers are overflowing from record oil and gas sales. Even McDonald's has reopened in Russia, rebranded under a Siberian billionaire's ownership. Meanwhile, Russia's military continues to hammer away at Ukraine with a steady supply of tanks and artillery. \nBut inside the Treasury Department, teams of sanctions experts view that resilience as a mirage. In exclusive interviews with CNN, top Treasury Department officials say they remain confident the sanctions are working and that beneath the surface, a much more dire story is unfolding within Russia's economy, where they contend real and lasting damage is being inflicted.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Biden officials worry their Russia sanctions were so powerful they also brought economic suffering to the US, report says (Insider)  \nUpdate #2: Do sanctions against Russia work?

In the worst cases, banks’ liquid cash reserves are exhausted, not everyone gets their money and the bank defaults. \nIt’s a grim scenario which, fortunately, has occurred rarely in history. \nThe most significant bank runs in the United States took place during the 1930’s Great Depression. More recently, there were runs on numerous U.S. banks during the Financial Crisis in 2008. \nIn Asia, bank runs have also been rare. A run on Japanese banks in 1927 led to the collapse of dozens of institutions across the country. There was a banking crisis in Myanmar in 2003 which the country has never really fully recovered from. \nBut perhaps since the Great Depression, none has been as significant compared to what is seemingly unfolding in China right now.    \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: China’s bank runs highlight abuse among small-bank shareholders, despite crackdown (SCMP) \nUpdate #2: China’s bank run is the biggest threat to markets right now.

But I sense some are now putting limits on what they could be due to lack of resources and growing concerns among many on where is all of this going. \nIn short. \nSome are looking for an off-ramp to end the war even if it means Ukraine must compromise on giving up territory.",
