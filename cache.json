A team of international researchers reported that some of the world's most important freshwater sources - from the Caspian Sea between Europe and Asia to South America's Lake Titicaca - lost water at a cumulative rate of around 22 gigatonnes per year for nearly three decades.

The military forces and Indigenous communities will continue in their tireless search to give the country the news it is waiting for,\" he said in his retraction.\nMore than 100 soldiers have been deployed with sniffer dogs to search for the minors who were traveling in an airplane that crashed on May 1, leaving three adults including the pilot and the children's mother dead.\nRescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old include a 13, nine and four-year-old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.\n\"At this time there is no other priority other than progressing with the search until finding them,\" added Petro. \"The children's lives are the most important thing.\"\nPetro's stunning announcement on Wednesday had been met with uncertainty as he gave no details about where or how the children had been rescued, nor how they had survived alone in the jungle.\nAmid widespread confusion, the military has not confirmed any rescue.\nAvianline Charters, owner of the crashed aircraft, had previously said that one of its pilots in the search area was told the children had been found and that they \"were being transported by boat downriver and that they were all alive.\"\nBut the company also said that \"there has been no official confirmation\" that the children were out of danger, and thunderstorms posed a risk to them reaching safety.\nPetro said on Thursday that the news of the supposed rescue had been provided by the government's Institute of Family Welfare.\n¬© 2023 AFP",

We have to be wary,\" he added.\nSting -- real name Gordon Sumner -- shot to fame with The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as \"Roxanne\", \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Walking on the Moon\".\nHe then forged a solo career with classics such as \"Englishman in New York\", \"Fields of Gold\" and \"Shape of My Heart\".\n¬© 2023 AFP",
