Sputnik/Sergei Karpukhin/Pool via Reuters \n\n \nThe Diplomat: The China-Russia Partnership After Prigozhin’s Mutiny: The View From Beijing \nWhile Chinese analysts – and likely the government – recognize the weaknesses of the Putin regime, Beijing is unlikely to fundamentally reassess its alignment with Moscow in the near term. \nJune 24 saw the swift beginning and end of a puzzling series of events in Russia. The mercurial Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the private military contractor Wagner Group, announced that his fighters would be undertaking what he termed a “march for justice” aimed squarely against the “incompetence” of the leadership of the Russian Ministry of Defense, namely Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov. \nRead more .... \n Update #1: What Beijing’s muted response to Wagner mutiny tells us about China-Russia relations – and what it doesn’t (The Conversation)\n \nUpdate #2: Wagner mutiny shows China’s ‘no limits’ partnership with Russia is a risky bet (SCMP)\n\n \nWNU Editor: There has been a lot of commentary in the past week on China's response to the Wagner mutiny. The consensus among most of the pundits is that there will be no change in the relationship. \nI disagree. \nI personally think Beijing is going to double down on its support for Putin. Beijing views its relationship with Russia as a vital strategic security ally that must be defended. Any threat to Putin's rule is not in China's interest. \nSo how will China respond? \nAside from continuing to provide political support, they will primarily respond by pumping even more money into the Russian economy and government coffers by doing things like this .... China is now importing more Russian oil than ever before - and Europe has almost entirely stopped buying crude from Moscow (Business Insider).",

Milley, Feb. 14, 2023. \n VOA: Chinese Army Invasion of Taiwan Not a Given, US General Says \nWASHINGTON - There is still time to dissuade Beijing not to use force to reunify Taiwan with mainland China, according to America’s most senior military official. \nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, said Friday that despite well-publicized plans calling for the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, there is no indication Chinese President Xi Jinping has made a decision one way or the other. \nSpeaking to an audience at the National Press Club in Washington, Milley said that gives the U.S. and other countries time to show Xi the use of force would be a bad idea.\n\n“You want to make sure that every single day, President Xi wakes up and says, 'Today is not that day,' and that that decision never comes,” he said.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Xi Jinping has yet to decide whether to order Taiwan unification by 2027: top US military adviser -- SCMP\n \nUpdate #2: Xi undecided on whether to order military unification with Taiwan by 2027, top US official claims (The Independent)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Many in Taiwan have a different point of view ....
