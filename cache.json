The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "French actor Gerard Depardieu's Legion d'Honneur medal is under review following a string of allegations about sexual aggression and a TV documentary in which he was heard making lewd comments about women. \nFrench Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak said on France 5 television she had asked the \"grande chancellerie\" committee in charge of the Legion d'Honneur - France's highest decoration - to start a disciplinary procedure to review whether the medal should be suspended or withdrawn.\nAbdul Malak said she was \"disgusted\" by comments made by Depardieu, one of France's most famous actors, during a 2018 trip to North Korea and broadcast in a \"Complement d'Enquete\" TV documentary on France 2 earlier this month.\n\"Shocking comments ... bringing shame on France,\" she said. Depardieu has been the focus of a string of accusations of sexism and sexual violence in recent years.\nIn March 2022, a Paris court ruled it would press ahead with an investigation into Depardieu after an actress accused him of rape. Charlotte Arnould had revealed that she was the woman behind the accusation, saying that she could not bear to remain silent any longer. Since then, more than 10 women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence.\nDepardieu, through his lawyer, has previously \"firmly rejected\" the accusations.\nIn an Oct. 2 letter published in French daily Le Figaro, Depardieu denied all blame.\n\"Never, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,\" he wrote. Depardieu has starred in scores of French-language movies, rising to prominence in 1974 with \"Going Places\", and gaining international recognition with a starring role in the 1990 English-language comedy \"Green Card\". He won a Golden Globe best actor award for that role.\nHis performance in the French-language \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" that same year won him the award for best male performance at the Cannes film festival, and a nomination in the best leading actor category at the 1990 Academy Awards.\n(Reuters)",

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has noted that these targets coincide with the ongoing local offensive operations by the Russians.\n\n \nDetails: Bild said Russia plans to occupy the entire territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and up to the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast by the end of 2024. \nISW noted that these targets overlap with Russia's ongoing local offensive operations in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv oblasts. \n Bild noted that Russia also plans to occupy a large part of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts, including the city of Kharkiv, if possible, in 2025 and 2026.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Russia's new war plan is to occupy more Ukrainian territory by 2026, report says (Business Insider)\n \nUpdate #2: Russia Has New and Extended War Plans in Ukraine: ISW (Newsweek)\n\n \nWNU Editor: I have doubts that the German publication BILD and the sources it uses has Russia's war plans up to 2026.
