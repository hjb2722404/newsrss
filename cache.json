However, Europe's record-breaking life expectancy has a downside: in order to pay for its increasingly healthy legion of retirees, the French right wing says there's no other option but to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. The left retorts that if corporations paid their fair share in taxes, that would more than sustain the country's cherished pay-as-you-go pension system. Ahead of what unions are billing as their biggest strikes yet against the government's pension reform, what exactly does the future hold for workers?",

          "description": "German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann has resolved to remove any remaining terms from the Nazi era from the statute books.\nIn a letter to his departmental colleagues, he recently pointed out \"that there are still laws and ordinances that use terminology from the Nazi era or in which the 'Reich' is mentioned,\" the lawyer told Sunday's edition of Die Welt newspaper in comments seen in advance by dpa.\nThe linguistic remnants appear in laws ranging from those on banking to practitioners of alternative medicine, he said.\n\"My goal is to eliminate these pre-constitutional remnants,\" the politician from the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) continued. For example, he said, there are still formulations in the criminal code for the offences of murder and manslaughter that go back to a \"National Socialist theory of types of perpetrators.\"\n\"In general, I have set myself the goal this year of bringing the entire special section of the criminal code up to date,\" the justice said.\nIn the end, it is always up to the legislators to decide. However, he sees \"a great openness\" in the ruling coalition in which his party is the junior partner with the Greens and the Social Democrats (SPD).",

It was as if the structure had “liquefied,” one survivor said.\nBeneath its colourful facade, the building had been extensively remodelled a few years ago without the necessary permits, but was later registered thanks to a 2018 zoning amnesty promulgated by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to a Reuters review of municipal and amnesty documents, architects drawings an…",
