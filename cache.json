Right now, the field is expanding very quickly in terms of methodology and data collection techniques, so I am confident that demand for data scientists will continue to grow.”\r \r As a result, each September intake for the MSDS admits around 100 students. They are expected to take five core courses and five electives to achieve a total of 30 credits. The foundational modules cover areas such as exploratory data analysis and visualisation, statistical machine learning, and storing and retrieving data. This provides strong training in key aspects of both theory and practice.\r \r The list of electives gives students scope to pick courses…",

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

House Bill 4293 would ban such marriages. \nThe Michigan state House passed the measure resoundingly, but GOP Reps. Steve Carra, Neil Friske, Matt Maddock, Angela Rigas and Josh Schriver all voted against the measure, Heartland Signal reports on its Twitter feed.\nSo far this century, 5,400 children (under the age of 18) were married in Michigan, but the numbers have declined steadily in recent years, the report said, noting 468 girls married in Michigan in 2000 compared to just 32 in 2021.\nDemocratic Rep. Kara Hope, one of the bill’s sponsors, said, \"It's hard to believe that this practice is still legal in Michigan in the year 2023,\" according to the report. \n\"Victims of child marriage have less stability in their financial situations, more unwanted pregnancies and worse health outcomes,\" it says.\nA United Nations initiative aims to end child marriage by 2030.",

They brutally retaliated against local villagers, killing five, including the local village chief. Unfortunately, this kind of savagery is nothing new for many in Mali, the Central African Republic, Libya, and other countries in Africa where the Wagner Group, a Russian-backed and oligarch-supported mercenary group, has taken up residence.
