Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov's friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have \"consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.\"\nAntov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. \nFrom the BBC: \"Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov's account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: 'It's extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.' The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a 'patriot of my country' and backed the war.\"\nRead the full report over at the BBC.",
