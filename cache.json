          "description": "British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.\nLead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.\nGahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.\n\"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil,\" he said of their 19th tour.\nThe band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words \"Berlin 4.10.22\".\nCredited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, \"Spirit\", in 2017. \"Memento Mori\" will be their 15th studio record.\nDepeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.\nThe band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as \"Personal Jesus\", \"People Are People\" and \"Enjoy the Silence\".\nThe group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.\n© 2022 AFP",

          "description": "BREAKING NEWS - Check back for updates\nBrazil’s presidential race will need to go to an October 30th second round after former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fell short of the 50%+1 he needed to avoid a run-off with extremist incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.\nBrazilians voted Sunday in a historic presidential election, with leftist front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who led in the pre-election polls, winning but still short of the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff election.\n\nThere are fears the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro will not accept a defeat after he warned that he will only leave office if he's \"killed, jailed, or victorious\" and has called on his base to \"go to war\" if the vote is \"stolen.\"\nBolsonaro took an early lead as results started coming in but in 2014, when Lula's leftist party last won a presidential election, it only took the lead after two hours of vote counting. Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.\nLula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.\n\nWith 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:\n\nWith 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:\n\n\nLula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.\nTo win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.\nPolls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.\nOfficial results can be found here: latest Brazil Election Results",

          "description": "Stock market movements over the next few weeks will be key in determining whether we are heading into a short-term or long-term recession, according to forex trader and crypto analyst Alessio Rastani.\nDuring the period October-December 2022, the analyst expects to see the S&P recover.  “If this bounces back or the rally fails and comes back down, then most likely we are entering a long-term recession and something very close to similar to 2008,” Rastani said in the latest Cointelegraph interview. \nAccording to the analyst, such a recession could last until 2024 and would inevitably negatively impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC). \nSpeaking about the latest pound crisis, Rastani believed that its main cause is the rally in the US dollar, which is putting pressure on most other fiat currencies, including the yen and the euro.  However, according to Rastani, the US dollar is approaching the top. \n“Once we see a clear break, a sustained break of the 111.5 and 110 levels on the dollar index, then I think the dollar is at the top. And then I’m looking for a multi-month decline in the dollar at 104 at the 100 level on the dollar index,” he explained. \nCheck complete maintenance on our Youtube channel and don’t forget to subscribe! \n\n\nSource Link",
