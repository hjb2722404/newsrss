          "description": "On an otherwise typical morning, one very important component of village life appeared to be missing. The proud parish of just 600, woke to find all the ‚ÄòEggs‚Äô in its namesake street signs and notice boards had mysteriously disappeared. The ‚ÄòWelcome to Egginton‚Äô signs bookending the village, now read ‚ÄòWelcome to ‚Ä¶Inton‚Äô leading to much head scratching from passers-by. As speculation grew, Egginton began to wonder who had hidden their eggs. In a cunning move, the unsuspecting residents were then given clues to a village location so Egginton could get its ‚ÄòEggs‚Äô back, as Cadbury revealed it was behind the amusing activity. The self-proclaimed ‚ÄòEaster obsessed‚Äô village, donned their Easter bonnet best and hopped at the chance to get involved in some early Easter fun. Within minutes, the entire parish (plus some curious local sheep and lambs) was gathered on mass, in search of its eggs. Egginton was led to a giant purple Cadbury Easter egg, peaking through the daffodils in a nearby open space. The generous collection was made up of hundreds of Cadbury Easter eggs ‚Äì one for everyone in the village to enjoy or hide for someone special this Easter.",
