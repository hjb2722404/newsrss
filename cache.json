By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Those higher-than-normal temperatures help explain why the National Hurricane Center’s tracking map on Tuesday looked a lot more like a snapshot from August than June. It shows two brewing systems east of the Lesser Antilles, including one that has already reached tropical storm strength, Bret. Named storms in June are rare and past ones have typically popped in the Gulf of Mexico or near the Atlantic coast. That hot water is...",

He's an economic disaster zone. The only thing he ever had was energy to sell the world and the Europeans have walked away from that.\"\n\"It looks as if he's really in a very weakened position,\" he added. \"I think the internal part was the biggest threat to him.\"\nWatch below or at the link:\n\n\nMSNBC 06 25 2023 10 10 01\n\nyoutu.be",

Baisotti has published a research paper on Chinese influence operations in Latin America. The paper, \"China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\" was published by the Florida International University's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy,\nAbstract: This paper analyzes the expansion of Chinese media and public diplomacy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Through its “discourse of power” and an attempt to extend its soft power across the continent, Chinese and some LAC media (print, audiovisual, and digital) sustained, amplified, and exalted the “achievements” of the Communist regime and the possibility of sharing them as a “community of common destiny” for all the world’s peoples. China strives to promote a positive image through communication and propaganda campaigns, incorporating LAC journalists, academics, politicians, and others who can improve its image as a reliable and supportive partner of the “Global South.”\nSource:  Pablo Baisotti, \"China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\" (2023). Research Publications. 55, https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/jgi_research/55.\nZFTWARNING\nTue, 06/27/2023 - 9:05pm\n\nRead more about China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\nLog in or register to post comments",
