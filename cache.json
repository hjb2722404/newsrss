During his administration's final days in office in January 2021, the United States added Cuba back to its list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nThat designation occurred the same month that Cuba's government moved to end its parallel currencies, phasing out a convertible peso that was pegged to the dollar, leaving only the regular, weaker peso, or CUP.\nSince then, the currency has fallen from 24 to an official rate of 120 to the dollar. On the black market, the rate is 185.\nTrump's successor Joe Biden has kept up the prior administration's restrictions on Cuba, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken in March said the United States had no plans to lift the state sponsor of terrorism designation.\n© Agence France-Presse",

China has a four-tier, color-coded weather-warning system, with red representing the most severe warning and blue the least severe.\nOn Tuesday morning, smog and misty grey clouds could be seen enveloping Beijing and the city's real-time air quality index was at a serious pollution level, according to the website of the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.\nThe concentration of fine particulates in the air in Beijing is currently 46.2 times the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline value, according to IQAir, a website that issues air quality data and information.\nA dozen provinces, including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Hubei, Inner Mongolia and metropolis Shanghai, will be affected by sandstorms and major dust until 8 a.m. (0000 GMT) Wednesday, the Central Meteorological Observatory said.\nThe sandstorms were again a hot dicussion topic on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, racking up 2.178 million chats.\nOne user wrote, \"What! When I wake up, why doesn't anyone issue a holiday notice, do you still have to go to work in the dust today!\"\nBeijing has regular sandstorms in March and April as it is near the large Gobi desert.\nA Chinese government official at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recently said the number of sandstorms was now four times higher than in the 1960s, a consequence of rising temperatures and lower precipitation in the deserts of north China and neighbouring Mongolia.\n(Reporting by Bernard Orr; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

          "description": "A new report from Politico suggests that Republicans are increasingly embracing what was once a fringe idea floated by former President Donald Trump: That America should bomb Mexico in the name of battling drug cartels.\nAlthough it was once considered unthinkable to conduct a military invasion of the United States' neighbor to the south, Politico documents how launching attacks against the country is becoming mainstream within the GOP.\n\"Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and Mike Waltz (R-FL) introduced a bill seeking authorization for the use of military force to 'put us at war with the cartels,'\" the report states. \"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said he is open to sending U.S. troops into Mexico to target drug lords even without that nation’s permission. And lawmakers in both chambers have filed legislation to label some cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move supported by GOP presidential aspirants.\"\nAlthough some traditionally hawkish Republicans, including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) have expressed skepticism that bombing Mexico would be an effective strategy for stopping the flow of fentanyl into the United States, the idea is nonetheless gaining traction.\nREAD MORE: Former Republican congressman slams 'slimy and unethical' Clarence and Ginni Thomas business enterprise\nEven so, some foreign policy experts warn Politico that a war in Mexico has the potential to be a complete foreign policy disaster for the United States.\n\"If you thought Iraq was a bad situation, wait until you invade a country on our border,” a House Republican congressional aide told the publication. “Our grandchildren will be dealing with this.”",

We have no further comment,\" Fox News said in a statement on Sunday.\nLawyers for Fox News and Dobbs referred Reuters to the statement. Khalil's lawyer did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nTrump has continued to repeat debunked claims of widespread voting fraud as reason for his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election even after they have been roundly rejected by courts, state governments and members of his own former administration.\nJury selection is set to begin on Thursday ahead of a separate trial in Dominion Voting Systems Corp's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company Fox Corp over their coverage of debunked election-rigging claims.\n(Reporting by Michael Martina and Jack Queen; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",

Although different groups may be behind the attacks from those places, these groups are likely all linked to Iran. The groups involved include Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and others that may go by different or new names, but which are proxies of Tehran. \nIran has long sought to bring its conflict with Israel to the Jewish state’s borders. Its backing of Hezbollah and Hamas was key to that strategy over the decades. For instance, Tehran supplies Hamas with financial support and also helped it develop longer-range rockets and a larger arsenal. Whereas Hamas rockets could once only travel a few kilometers, now they can reach most parts of Israel. \nThe Islamic Republic also supported Islamic Jihad, which is even more of an Iranian proxy than Hamas. The group not only has an arsenal thought to include thousands of rockets, but it has gunmen in the West Bank and its leadership often resides in Damascus.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The mood in Israel is that they are now facing Iran and its allies on multiple-fronts ....
