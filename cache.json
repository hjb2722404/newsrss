The summit aims to bring together Arab and European heads of state to discuss the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the future of the Palestinian issue. However, there is uncertainty about who will attend, with no confirmation from the US, China, or Russia. Arab countries have expressed anger at Israel's actions in Gaza.",

The provisions are intended to bring some relief to the Palestinians in Gaza, which is being blockaded by Israel in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on towns in southern Israel. \n\nMany in Gaza, reduced to eating one meal a day and without enough water to drink, are waiting desperately for the aid. It was unclear whether fuel would be allowed across to power hospital generators. \n\nOn Friday, workers began repairing damaged to the crossing caused by Israeli bombings. Officials hoped to open the crossing on Saturday.",

          "description": "French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne avoided parliamentary censure in an early morning vote on Saturday after she forced the government's budget plan through the National Assembly without a vote. \nThe motion to censure Borne â the 18th levelled at her since she assumed the office â was brought by the left-wing Nupes alliance after the prime minister activated Article 49.3 to adopt the public finance bill without a vote.\nThe motion received just 193 of the 289 votes needed to succeed, an unsurprising outcome in light of the lack of support from the centre-right.\nIts rejection constitutes the adoption of the 2023-2027 budget program, which now moves to the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament.\nThe speaker for Nupes, socialist Philippe Brun, accused the government of \"favouring with the greatest servility a very well-endowed minority of the French\" despite \"an immense inflationary crisis\".\nPresident Emmanuel Macron had \"tried to make parliament disappear with his repeated (use of) 49.3\", Brun added.\nThe far right had supported the left's motion of censure, accusing Borne of the \"repeated and abusive use of 49.3\".\nBorne, for her part, hit back at both factions, saying \"demagoguery is your only budgetary course\".\nThe government also resorted to Article 49.3 earlier this year to push through unpopular pension reforms, sparking violent protests.\n(AFP)",

          "description": "The head of Italy's rhythmic gymnastics national team, suspended after a group of former athletes made allegations of bullying over their weight and diets, received a simple warning on Friday.\nEmanuela Maccarani had been relieved of her role within the Italian gymnastics federation (FGI) pending investigations into her behaviour.\nOn Friday, the FGI disciplinary commission, followed recommendations of the body's federal prosecutor Michele Rossetti that \"there was no evidence of intentionally or excessively vexatious behavior in relations with the gymnasts\".\n\"There was no relentless effort to obtain an additional medal,\" he added.\nMaccarani's assistant Olga Tishina was cleared of any fault.\nIn late October, three former rhythmic gymnastics, including two double world champions, made claims of abuse in a series of interviews with daily La Repubblica.\nOne of the gymnasts, Anna Basta, said she had twice thought about killing herself, while 19-year-old Nina Corradini quit the national set-up in 2021 after spending \"every minute of the previous few months wishing I could escape\".\nGiulia Galtarossa, a world champion in 2009 and 2010 who is and now 31, said she was berated by a coaching assistant for eating a pear, and handed her diet sheet with the message \"we have a little piggy in the squad\".\nMaccarani had held the position of Italy's rhythmic gymnastics team's technical director since 2018. She was also the team's long-time head coach.\nShe had denied claims of psychological abuse, saying the accusations came from disgruntled gymnasts who were not selected for Olympic squads.\nParents of gymnasts training at the national centre in Desio wrote a letter to the head of Italy's Olympic Committee in support of the 57-year-old, who has won a raft of medals for Italy since taking charge in 1996.\nÂ© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Twin shootings in Rotterdam on Thursday have resulted in an unknown number of fatalities, police said.\nA gunman dressed in combat gear opened fire in a flat in the Dutch city then burst into a nearby medical centre. Fires broke out in both places but were later extinguished.\nâThe two shooting incidents in Rotterdam have resulted in fatalities. We will first inform family and relatives and will explain more later,â the city police said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\nElite police units had burst into the hospital in the Dutch city searching for the suspect, who was armed with a handgun, authorities said.\nThe suspect is 32 and the motive for the attack is unknown, local news agency ANP said, citing police. He is suspected of carrying out both shootings and there is not a second shooter, police said.\nPictures from the scene showed people streaming out of the hospital, including medics and patients, as police in body armour moved in. Police helicopters buzzed overhead.\nMedics in white coats wheeled patients out on stretchers and wheelchairs\nPolice had earlier said the suspect was wearing âcombat-styleâ clothes, was tall, with black hair and carrying a backpack.\nâFirst there was a shooting on the fourth floor. Four or five shots were fired. Then a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the education centre,â said a medical student cited by RTL Nieuws, who did not give his name.\nâThere was a lot of panic and screaming... I didnât hear any shots, just the panic and thatâs what I started to act on,â public broadcaster NOS cited another eyewitness as saying.\nRotterdam is often the scene of shootings, usually attributed to score settling by rival drug gangs.\nAuthorities were expected to hold a news conference shortly to give more details.\nIn 2019, three people were shot dead on a tram in Utrecht, sparking a huge manhunt.\nAnd in 2011, the country was left shocked when 24-year Tristan van der Vlis killed six people and wounded 10 others in a rampage at a packed shopping mall.\n(AFP)",
