I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at.\"\nThe White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were \"not true.\"\nMusk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.\nThe world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.\nHe also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.\nIan Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Nandita Bose in Washington and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Howard Goller)",

In case you’ve been sleeping under a rock, the basic scam is this: \n* The Democrats have ginned up the Ukrainian War and convinced Congress to donate billions in taxpayer money to Ukraine. \n* FTX convinced its investors that a good portion of its profits would be donated to the National Bank of Ukraine. \n* There are strong suspicions that some portion of this money sent to Ukraine was not used to fight Russia but was instead reinvested in FTX. \n* The Chief of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, was the #2 donor to the Democrats, just behind George Soros. To think that this didn’t buy him some “protection” would make you very naive. \nThe fact that the legacy media is not openly reporting this massive scam is telling.   \nUpdate: One half of The Duran provides his analysis, about 5 minutes into this video.  \nUpdate 2: Robert Barnes and Viva Frei share their thoughts.",

But what really irked the authorities was that the videos they took only showed 100 - 200 civilians going out to greet the Ukrainian forces when they entered the city. The mass majority of the residents stayed inside their homes. This ruined the media narrative of thousands showing up that they wanted. \nEven Zelensky's visit to Kherson today did not result in large crowds of people going on the streets to greet him. This was a tightly controlled PR event, and the videos that were released showed mostly close-ups or the camera was positioned at ground level. Very few if any camera shots from above looking down and giving a wide angle view.",
