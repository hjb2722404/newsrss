I’ll book a direct flight at the right time, then get an email days or weeks later with an inconvenient time change or an extra layover or both.  The worst was when I was planning a trip with my daughter to Tampa, Florida.  In January, I booked a direct flight on Southwest Airlines that departed Hartford, Connecticut, at 12:30 p.m. on April 17 and arrived in Tampa three hours later.  .  Perfect.  But on February 15, Southwest sent me an e-mail telling me that they had transferred me to a 6:15 p.m. flight with an almost three-hour layover in Nashville, bringing me to Tampa at 1:10 a.m.!

Do that, and the space will open up around the perimeter.\n“Attack, attack, attack,” Kidd said, his voice betraying great urgency.  “Make them work.”\nIt was a smart strategy, and sure enough, it worked.  The Mavericks generated a respectable number of 3-point clean looks.  The problem?  They couldn’t do much.

The pecking order changes and is not in his favor.  After breaking down in tears mid-match at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., in March after a heckler rocked her in a second-round loss, she bounced back to reach the final of the Miami Open, where Swiatek beat her, 6-4, 6-0.\nOsaka, who plays for Japan and is based in the United States, remains one of the biggest stars in the sport and the highest paid female athlete in the world by far.  She has enough lucrative long-term endorsement deals to justify recently break up with IMG to set up his own management agency with Stuart Duguid, his agent.\nBut Osaka will be ranked around world No. 40 after Roland Garros, and while his portfolio looks strong in redwood, how does that affect the bottom line and his place in the sporting landscape if a young player like Swiatek takes the real control of the sport and younger, possibly hungrier players like Anisimova continue to dominate Osaka at the start of major tournaments?\nTo what extent, in the age of social media, should results and stardom continue to align once the millions of followers are already acquired?\nOsaka, left ankle wrapped, seemed genuinely determined to change her luck on Monday, digging into the corners and maintaining positive energy almost to the end.  But Anisimova has been more consistent on serve and more devastating from the baseline and, crucially, on the returns.\n\nSource Link",

The Celtics were quicker to drop balls, more active in disrupting passing lanes, and more coordinated in switches, limiting quality looks for Miami.  They were more pressing to get back on defense and turn in the paint, not allowing the Heat to push for quick breaks like they did on Saturday.  Boston’s defense was so effective that Miami only fired two 3-pointers in the first quarter, limiting its chances of closing the deficit until it was too late.  That was exactly the kind of energy Boston was sorely lacking in the first half of Game 3.

In the latest version, to start mining, crypto mining companies must register as sole proprietor or self-employed.  Companies would follow a standard procedure for company registration. \nRelated: Russia To Include Crypto In Its Tax Code: Here’s What The Rules Could Look Like\nAnother correction swept away the promise of tax amnesty in the first year of registration.

          "description": "Chinese consumers “are pissed off, they’re worried about the future,” Dunne said.  “It’s a double whammy that Tesla faces in China.”\nTesla shares are reacting in part to the same forces rocking stock markets around the world: the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, the threat of recession, supply chain chaos and soaring coronavirus. ‘inflation.  But Tesla shares have fallen far more than other Silicon Valley giants like Apple or Alphabet, the company that owns Google.\nTesla accounted for three-quarters of electric cars sold in the United States last year.  The company is several years ahead of its competitors in battery and software technology.  But two models — the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y sport utility vehicle — accounted for 95% of Tesla’s sales.  Its next consumer vehicle, a pickup truck, has been repeatedly delayed and isn’t expected until next year at the earliest.\nIt’s an axiom in the automotive industry that new models drive sales.  And competition from Hyundai, Ford and Volkswagen is growing, giving drivers a lot more choice.\nJesse Toprak, an auto industry veteran who is a chief analyst at Autonomy, a company that offers electric cars by subscription, said Tesla’s market share will fall below 40% by the end of 2023. , although its sales will continue to grow as the overall market expands.\n“They’ll have a smaller slice of a bigger pot,” Toprak said.  “But their virtual monopoly on U.S. EV sales will slowly diminish.”\nTesla already faces stiff competition in Europe, where electric vehicles account for 13% of new car sales.  This foreshadows what could happen in the United States, where battery car sales are just starting to take off.  Volkswagen, which has invested heavily in electric vehicles, sold 56,000 battery cars in Western Europe in the first three months of the year, second only to Tesla, which sold 58,000, according to figures compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research in Berlin.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "But determining when and in whom the mutations first appeared requires many more virus samples from farm workers, local residents and mink, collected before and after the outbreak.  “That data doesn’t exist,” said Arinjay Banerjee, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.\nThroughout 2020, testing has been difficult for Americans to access, and few patient samples have been sequenced.  Surveillance in animals was even worse; until this springfederal officials have explicitly recommended against routinely testing animals for the virus.\n“Large-scale testing was not available and then there was a shortage of some supplies,” Dr Behravesh said.  “So we didn’t want there to be, you know, a mad rush to test animals.”\nWithout more samples, it’s impossible to rule out the possibility that the variant originated in humans, who then spread it to mink, the scientists said.\nA bigger puzzle is how the taxidermist and his wife got it.  The most likely possibility, according to several experts, is that the variant was circulating more widely in the human population than previously known, and that the couple caught it from another infected person.\nAnother possibility, more speculative, is that they have recovered the variant from another animal species.  “Taxisdermists deal with other dead animals,” said Linda Saif, a virologist and immunologist at Ohio State University.\nBut because the cases were detected “weeks to months” after the two fell ill, testing every animal they might have come into contact with “was not feasible or not indicated”, he said. said Lynn Sutfin, Michigan DHHS spokeswoman.\n\nSource Link",

Here’s how Russia is zeroing in on key Ukrainian stronghold Severodonetsk (The Print). And then there is this sobering on the ground report from Euronews on how dire the situation is becoming in eastern Ukraine (see video below). \nIf this is slow and unsuccessful, then why the rush to send tens of billions in arms? Why escalate a greater involvement in this conflict? \nMy gut tells me that the Pentagon leadership are very worried on the military situation that is unfolding right now, and are trying their best to assist the Ukrainians as best as they could to contain the Russian military and their offensive in the Donbas.

          "description": "WNU Editor: The key part from yesterday's interview is this ....  .... Tom Cotton: It’s important that we support the Ukrainians as they defend themselves against this war of aggression by Vladimir Putin. So, first off I do understand the reservations some people had about the legislation. And there was some excessive or unnecessary measures. But a lot of that money went to support our own military and our own troops to replenish the stockpiles of our weapons that those troops need to defend themselves and protect our country. And not just support our allies in Europe but in the Western Pacific, Taiwan in particular. Second, I think it is important that we help the Ukrainians fight their own war. This is much like what Ronald Reagan did in Afghanistan… And finally, I think our main adversary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party is watching very carefully what is happening in Europe. If they see the United States and our allies falter in our resolve to support Ukraine in defending itself against an invasion by Russia, then I think Xi Jinping would believe that there is no way we would come to the aid of Taiwan.  \nAs to what is my take. \nChina is watching closely the West's response to the Russia - Ukraine war. But when it comes to Taiwan Beijing will act according to what is their national security interests, and if they feel threatened they will act irregardless on how the West will respond.",
