Lightnings.\nEven with logistics and production volume straightened out, the lingering question for Jackson County residents and Americans alike is whether batteries made on the road in SK will power vehicles ultimately as accessible as Ford’s Model T.  Henry Ford called it a vehicle “for the great multitude,” and it fueled America’s original automobile revolution.\nAs usual, silver bullets are rare.  And like most major challenges, it helps if a solution is to create something cool.\nMaddison Dean, a Jackson County native, was hired earlier this year by SK for a community relations role.  In April, she gave a presentation on the company to over a hundred juniors and seniors at Commerce High School, her alma mater.  In the auditorium, she provided insight into electric vehicles, the rapidly changing future of automakers, and how SK operations work.\n“I told them, feel free to interrupt me anytime, just raise your hand,” she said.  At first, she didn’t have many takers.  “You know, especially talking to high school kids, they’re just sort of transparent, they’re like, ‘Yeah, whatever, that’s an excuse for us to be out of class, but we don’t lend it don’t pay attention.  “”\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "It was a long-term gamble on liquid natural gas, but it paid off and turned the United States into a major exporter of fossil fuels.\nJournalist Jake Bittle delves into the career of Charif Souki, the Lebanese-American entrepreneur whose appetite for risk changed the course of America’s energy sector.\nThe article describes how Mr. Souki went from restaurant owner in Los Angeles to co-founder and CEO of Cheniere Energy, an oil and gas company specializing in liquefied natural gas, and provides insight into his process of reflection: “According to Souki,” writes Mr. Bittle, “the need to provide energy to the world in the short term outweighs the long-term demand to act on carbon emissions”.\n\n\nAt a time of acute climate anxiety, Mr. Souki’s rationale might seem outdated, even brazen.  The world may be facing energy and climate crises, Mr Souki told The New York Times, “but one is going to happen this month, and the other is 40 years from now.”\n\n\n“If you tell someone, ‘You’re going to run out of power this month,’ and then you tell the same person about what’s going to happen 40 years from now,” he said, “they say, ‘What do you care about in 40 years?’  »\n\n\n\nAdditional production for The Sunday Read was contributed by Emma Kehlbeck, Parin Behrooz, Anna Diamond, Sarah Diamond, Jack D’Isidoro, Elena Hecht, Desiree Ibekwe, Tanya Pérez, Marion Lozano, Naomi Noury, Krish Seenivasan, Corey Schreppel, Margaret Willison, Kate Winslett and Tiana Young.

The flowers that a family had brought were beginning to wilt.  The babies were crying.  The crowd was huddled in the shade, greetings and laughter alternating with silence, their excitement cut by the tension.\nBy the clock, the prison authorities were running late.  But Khaled Dawoud, a former detainee, was used to their ways.  By Egyptian standards, he joked, a three-hour delay to see his former cellmate and five other political prisoners released was nothing.\n\n\n“My heart goes like,” Mr Dawoud said, clapping his hand to his chest.  A journalist and opposition politician, he had spent more than 18 months in Tora as …",

          "description": "When the pandemic closings hit the real estate sector, showings were halted, homes were taken off the market and municipal offices that process closing documents were closed.  As a result, in March 2020, almost 18% of purchase contracts in the United States were canceled – although it took only a few months to return to normal levels.\nBut in 2022, the frequency of canceled transactions started to rise again, reaching almost 15% in June – the highest rate since the peak of the pandemic, according to a recent report by red finwhich represents approximately 60,000 failed home sales across the country.\nThe likely culprit: rising mortgage interest rates.  The journey between the accepted offer and the closing day can take up to two months or more, and interest rates sometimes change in the meantime.  Buyers can lock in rates for certain periods, but not all do, and even a small increase can stretch monthly payments out of reach and kill a deal.  And the rate increases this year have been substantial.  Consider, for example, that the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose from 3.79% in January to 5.3% in July.  This change would increase a monthly payment approximately $90 for every $100,000 borrowed.\n\n\nThe places with the highest percentage of deals failed in June – including many in the south and southwest – are among the most popular with buyers.  In Las Vegas, just over 27% of trades failed in June, the highest rate of any market, according to Redfin.  Preferred Florida destinations followed, including Lakeland, Florida at just under 27% and Cape Coral, Florida at just under 26%.\n\n\nThis week’s chart shows the US metropolitan markets where the highest share of trades failed in June.\n\nSource Link",
