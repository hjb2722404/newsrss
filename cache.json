And it was not a direct grudge against Mr. Abe. A religious group had supported Mr. Abe, and a murderer with a grudge against the religious group killed him. Murders targeting politicians are often related to political messages or claims. This is a very unique case in that the murder was committed out of a personal grudge, not against the individual for what he did, but against the organization that supported the individual.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2022/07/11/31351\">Read the full story, “Recalling Shinzo Abe with Respect”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>",

Michael Kappeler/dpa\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.\nUkraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.\nMelnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.\nRecently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.\nMelnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.\nThe Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of \"distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.\"\nMelnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. \"Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,\" Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations \"absurd.\"\nMelnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.\nSome German media, including Bild and Süddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.",

His time in office – and the nature of his departure – throw up vital questions about democratic values and institutions.\nBlaming the failings of an entire political culture on the moral deficiencies of one leader might make us feel righteous, but most of us know that the rot goes rather deeper than one flamboyant character. The fall of Johnson could be taken as a historical juncture to be built upon – and not just in the UK.\nSome have argued that the political debate preceding the Brexit referendum was a nadir; that public hopes and fears were cynically exploited by politicians who did not even believe the substance of their own messages.

          "description": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Clear skies in Sydney on Friday brought relief to Australia's largest city after nearly a week of downpours, with thousands of residents returning home to take stock of flood damage while authorities ramped up relief efforts.\nFlooding continued, though, in Sydney's west and some regions north of the city, even as an intense low-pressure system tapered off across Australia's east coast, with water still getting dumped into rivers from heavy rains that began last weekend.\n\"The east coast low has gone off the coast, which is great news, but we have a lot of flood warnings (now) and they will remain current for a few days and even into early next week,\" state emergency services Deputy Commissioner Ashley Sullivan told ABC television.\nAbout 47,000 residents in Australia's most populous state have been ordered to evacuate or were warned they might receive evacuation orders, down from 60,000 on Thursday, authorities said. Many still have no access to power or the internet.\nHundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.\nTaking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.\nRiver catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.\n\"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,\" Sullivan said.\nMore than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.\nA La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",

          "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.\nEarlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com \"Love Actually,\" asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast \"Yakety Sax\" — aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy \"The Benny Hill Show\" — outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.\n \"Morning @snb19692,\" tweeted Grant. \"Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?\"\nLucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:\n\n\\u201cMorning @snb19692  Glad you have your speakers back.

          "description": "“The problem is that Kim’s ideals aren’t wrong,” she said.  “But the way she does it is.”\nIn five and a half seasons, Kim’s long slide to perdition has become undoubtedly the narrative keystone of the series.  It has not always been so.  When it started, “Saul,” a prequel to “Breaking Bad,” seemed mostly focused on transforming slippery but fundamentally decent Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into Albuquerque’s sleaziest lawyer, Saul Goodman.  Kim’s ultimate role was then uncertain, even for the screenwriters.\n“We had no idea when we started how important his character was going to be,” said showrunner and co-creator Peter Gould.  “If you watch the pilot of the show, she probably has three lines of dialogue.”\nIt soon became clear, however, that the character of Seehorn, who started (outwardly) as a straight arrow with a promising legal career, would be an integral part of Jimmy’s makeover.  Like Jimmy, Kim was breaking badly.  Unlike Jimmy, however, Kim never appears in “Breaking Bad,” leading many fans to assume the worst.  The stakes were always potentially higher for her than for the guy with her name in the title.\nThat seems like a lot to bear, given that “Saul” is one of TV’s most critically acclaimed series.  But if so, Seehorn, 50, who has been performing on screens and on stages since the ’90s, handles it with grace.  Unlike the purse-lipped, inscrutable Kim, Seehorn isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, either professionally or, ultimately, in conversation.  She has no problem, for example, talking at length about a rash.  She’s funny and has a blinding, spontaneous smile that made me wonder if I’d ever seen Kim Wexler’s teeth (despite all those teeth-brushing scenes).\n\nSource Link",

Maybe it’s just that, as Thoreau observed, “one man can stand there and put all of America behind him.”  Perhaps – and this was certainly true for the first part of the 20th century – it was the remoteness and isolation of the place, the feeling that as the land stretches out towards the Atlantic, in one long, twisting branch, the current conventional world slips away, allowing you to rethink, reinvent, and get away with all sorts of things.
