I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!\"\nThe queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.\nFurther back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.\nPeru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.\nHis supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.\nBoluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.\n\"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration,\" said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.\nCongress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.\n\"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,\" added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a \"quagmire.\"\nBut protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.\nIn seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.\nSome of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.\nThose southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.\nAs well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.\nThat resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.\n(AFP)",

Unless the Crimean peninsula is at the very least “demilitarized” Ukraine won’t feel safe, while the ideal end to the current conflict is with a revolution in Moscow, the US Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said on Thursday. \n Ukrainians “have to get to a map that is more sustainable for them,” Nuland said in a video interview with the Washington think tank Carnegie Endowment. \nThey have “significant chunks of territory they need to be a viable state, before you even get to the question of Crimea, and that’s what they’re focused on now.” \nThe US position is that Ukraine is “owed and due all of their territory within their international borders,” which means Crimea as well, Nuland added.  And it continues ....  ....Asked how she saw the conflict ending, Nuland said the West “must never trust, as long as Vladimir Putin is in power, or somebody like him, that this is truly over.” Even if the fighting ends on Ukraine’s terms, there “has to be a long-term plan” to build up Ukraine’s military as a deterrent. She also expressed a preference for Russians overthrowing their government for a “better future” offered by the West.",

Credit: Danish Defence    \nUnherd: OSINT picks holes in Seymour Hersh’s Nord Stream claims \nOpen-source analysts argue that the journalist's theory doesn't add up \nSince he published an explosive Substack piece earlier this month, arguing — in great detail — how the United States was responsible for the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipeline between Russia and Germany last year, the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has received both enthusiastic support and dismissal. The White House responded quickly to label Hersh’s claims ‘utterly false and complete fiction’, an assessment which the CIA and State Department echoed. Russian state representatives have, unsurprisingly, been more open to the theory. Indeed, the State Duma today proposed an urgent UN investigation into the attack based on the article.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: An interesting read. It looks like Seymour Hersh's timeline is wrong when he said the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had links to the US intel community when he was young. Jens Stoltenberg  actually knew a Soviet diplomat when he was in his twenties, and was told by Norways Security Service to break contact with this suspected KGB spy. \nIt also looks like Seymour Hersh is wrong in identifying the naval ships that were involved in this operation. Apparently some were not in the vicinity during the timeline of this operation. \nDoes this mean that Seymour Hersh's annonymous sources are wrong? Maybe. But there is a lot of details and information in his reporting, and they are not being refuted. \nIn the meantime Seymour Hersh is conducting a few interviews, and answering questions ....
