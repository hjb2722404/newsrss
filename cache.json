The military forces and Indigenous communities will continue in their tireless search to give the country the news it is waiting for,\" he said in his retraction.\nMore than 100 soldiers have been deployed with sniffer dogs to search for the minors who were traveling in an airplane that crashed on May 1, leaving three adults including the pilot and the children's mother dead.\nRescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old include a 13, nine and four-year-old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.\n\"At this time there is no other priority other than progressing with the search until finding them,\" added Petro. \"The children's lives are the most important thing.\"\nPetro's stunning announcement on Wednesday had been met with uncertainty as he gave no details about where or how the children had been rescued, nor how they had survived alone in the jungle.\nAmid widespread confusion, the military has not confirmed any rescue.\nAvianline Charters, owner of the crashed aircraft, had previously said that one of its pilots in the search area was told the children had been found and that they \"were being transported by boat downriver and that they were all alive.\"\nBut the company also said that \"there has been no official confirmation\" that the children were out of danger, and thunderstorms posed a risk to them reaching safety.\nPetro said on Thursday that the news of the supposed rescue had been provided by the government's Institute of Family Welfare.\n© 2023 AFP",

We have to be wary,\" he added.\nSting -- real name Gordon Sumner -- shot to fame with The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as \"Roxanne\", \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Walking on the Moon\".\nHe then forged a solo career with classics such as \"Englishman in New York\", \"Fields of Gold\" and \"Shape of My Heart\".\n© 2023 AFP",

While other parts of the front remained relatively stable, both sides actively brought forces to this small city. For Kiev, which in May 2022 suffered a defeat at Azovstal that helped undermine its image, Artyomovsk became the new Mariupol. Ukrainian propaganda labeled it ‘the Bakhmut Fortress’, and attempted to give an air of heroism to those fighting there. \nDespite the fact that the city has no strategic importance for advancing westward, Russian troops accepted the challenge posed by Ukrainian propaganda. So what did Moscow gain from the nine-month-long ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’?\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: A very candid and blunt summary from the Russian side on the nine month campaign to take Bakhmut.",

Apparently this missile strike occurred in early May, a few days after the Ukraine drone attack on the Kremlin.\n\n\nHere is a summary of what I have been hearing .... Exclusive/Classified: General Zaluzhny Seriously Wounded in Bakhmut (The Intel Drop). \nI do not know if Zaluzhny was/is wounded and/or killed. But I do know that Zaluzhnyi skipped a critical NATO meeting on May 10 (link here), and he has not made any public appearances since then. \nHe had a phone conversation with top US General Milley a few days ago, but that was only done by phone with no video link (link here). \nKnowing that morale would collapse if reports that Zeluzhnyi was seriously wounded and/or killed were to spread (and they are spreading), the Ukraine Defense Ministry made a public statement today calling reports that General Zaluzhny was wounded and/or killed as Russian disinformation/propaganda .... Russia spreads false claims about \"disappearance\" of Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief in light of tensions in Bakhmut (Ukrainska Pravda). \nI say why make a public statement? Just make a 30 second video of him somewhere talking about an event that everyone knows is current.\n\nThis would kill all rumors and speculation immediately.\nBut the Ukraine government and Defense Ministry  are not doing it. \nSo what is happening? \nMy gut tells me that he is OK. That he is focused on the war and he does not want to be distracted. \nBut it is odd that he has made himself sparse in the past few weeks. Even to Western allies who are critical to Ukraine's war effort. And he has been completely silent on the battle and fall of Bakhmut. Something is amiss.",
