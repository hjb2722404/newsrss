England, in the shadow of the First World War.  “Peaky” reminded the rapper of how he got involved in gang culture in Los Angeles, Knight said.\n“How the connection occurs between 1920s Birmingham and South Central, I don’t know,” said Knight, 62.  “I think you just get lucky with certain projects and that resonates with people.”\n\n\nSince its premiere in Britain in 2013, the tumultuous fortunes of the Shelby family, led by Tommy …",

As paradoxical as it may seem, finding cancers earlier could mean as many deaths, at the same time, as without early diagnosis.  Indeed, at least with current treatments, cancers meant to kill are not necessarily cured if caught early.\nAnd there are other risks.  For example, some will test positive, but doctors will be unable to locate the cancer.  Others will be aggressively treated with surgery or chemotherapy for cancers that, if left alone, would not have grown and spread and may even be gone.\nDr. Beer acknowledges that a blood test for cancer “is not without risk or cost, and will not detect all cancers”.\nBut, he said, “I think there’s the promise of real impact.”\nOther experts are worried.\nDr. Barnett Kramer, a member of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine and former director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute, worries that testing will go mainstream without ever showing it’s beneficial .  Once that happens, he said, “it’s hard to ring the bell.”\n“Hopefully we’re not halfway to a nightmare,” Dr. Kramer said.\nDamocles syndrome\nWhen Susan Iorio Bell, 73, a nurse who lives in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, saw an ad on Facebook recruiting women her age for a cancer blood test study, she immediately signed up.

Image credit: Creative Commons. \n19FortyFive: There Is No Military Path for Ukraine To ‘Defeat’ Russia \nThe Tide of Battle – and Mounting Casualties – Turning Against Ukraine – Since it became evident a few weeks into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that Moscow’s troops were stopped cold outside of Kyiv, there has been a near-universal belief in the West that Ukraine would eventually win. All that was needed, many pundits claimed, was to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces sufficient numbers of weapons and ammunition. As the war now grinds towards the four-month mark, it is becoming painfully evident that the odds are stacked in Russia’s favor. \nMilitarily speaking, there is no rational path through which Ukraine will ever win its war. Without a course correction – and soon – Kyiv itself may not ultimately be safe.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: You know the situation is deteriorating fast when Ukraine President Zelensky's top adviser is making an urgent request to NATO at their meeting this Wednesday for these weapons (see tweet below). \nUkraine had most of these weapons before the war, and to me this adviser is admitting that they now need to be replaced because most have been lost and destroyed. A testament to how brutal this war is becoming. \nI am also being told by one source in Ukraine that I trust that the Ukrainian military losses are not 100 - 200 soldiers a day, but two to three times that. If true, these numbers are staggering, and you cannot sustain a war with that type of losses, let alone mounting a counter-offensive to defeat the Russian military. \n\nBeing straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity:\n 1000 howitzers caliber 155 mm;\n 300 MLRS;\n 500 tanks;\n 2000 armored vehicles;\n 1000 drones.\nContact Group of Defense Ministers meeting is held in #Brussels on June 15. We are waiting for a decision.\n— Михайло Подоляк (@Podolyak_M) June 13, 2022",
