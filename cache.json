          "description": "From Bollywood-style dance to henna tattoo workshops, celebrations for Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs record-breaking 70-year reign in the northwestern English city of Preston had a multicultural flavour on Saturday. With a population of 140,000 and close to Manchester, Preston is home to a large community with South Asian ancestry, and this year combined its annual festival of subcontinental arts, culture, tradition and heritage with celebrations for the queen‚Äôs Platinum Jubilee. To mark the royal landmark, the Preston City Mela, a showcase for all things South Asian since 1997, broadened its scope to include culture from the 54 Commonwealth countries.  ‚ÄúOf course we live in this country and we do love our queen, but it‚Äôs nice to have our culture in the spotlight for a change, and all the Commonwealth cultures as well,‚Äù Hanifa, a Preston resident of Indonesian origin, told Agence France-Presse. ‚ÄúThe atmosphere is so nice and to have all those influences, all these cultures, makes it even nicer,‚Äù said the 60-year-old, who was enjoying the day with friends. She said she watched on television as the royal celebrations got under way in central London on Thursday with the Trooping of the Colour military parade, and found it ‚Äúmoving‚Äù to see the queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family. Gulab Singh, organiser of the Preston mela, said this year‚Äôs curators had tried to align with the jubilee ‚Äúas much as we can‚Äù. ‚ÄúWith the Mela, it‚Äôs always South Asian art, but we‚Äôve broadened it up to reflect the Commonwealth perspective,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúThis year, we have a cake-cutting ceremony ‚Ä¶ Cake cutting is sooo British,‚Äù added fellow organiser Shreya Ghodke. The Commonwealth is a grouping of mainly former British colonies headed by the queen, who is also head of state in 14 of these countries or realms in addition to the UK. Australia, New Zealand hail Queen Elizabeth as republic question returns Sitting in the sun, 58-year-old Amit Chauhan was getting into the festive mood, eating vegetable samosas and nodding to the music‚Ä¶",

Plus, it may have had a slow start here in France but the #MeToo movement is beginning to have an impact in a variety of sectors including the media and politics.

          "description": "Data from the app showed that in 2021, users hosted more than 3,600 bachelorette parties in Scottsdale, compared to about 13,000 in Nashville, said Mike Petrakis, 31, founder and chief executive of Bach.  This year, its data shows that more than 11,600 parties are planned in Scottsdale, compared to 30,000 in Nashville.  If that rate of growth continues in Scottsdale, Mr. Petrakis said, it has the potential to overtake Nashville in terms of bookings.  And on a recent weekend in May, more than one bachelor party attendee said Scottsdale was ‚Äúthe new Nashville.‚Äù\nRobert Mayer, 35, owner of Arizona Party Bike, said his Scottsdale location began booking a record number of bachelorette parties in the summer of 2020. Brides were looking for a place to celebrate without restrictions pandemics, he added.  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, never enacted a statewide mask mandate and reopened restaurants for indoor dining in May 2020. In Maricopa County , which includes Scottsdale, about 1,200 new Covid cases are currently reported per day.\nMr. Mayer‚Äôs company, which features on Bach, runs tours of the Old Town on cart-sized cranksets, charging up to $499 (plus the cost of alcohol) for two-hour private tours for up to 15 people.  His clientele is currently 75% female, with a median age of 28, he said.  Local outfitters of hot air balloons and desert jeep tours are also teeming with groups of women in their twenties singing Katy Perry songs and only occasionally throwing up.\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that the influx has already caused unrest.  One Saturday in May at the Arizona Party Bike depot in Old Town, Lacy Gray, 27, a company guide, had to explain the rules of the road to a South Dakota bachelor party after her members, sporting candy-colored wigs, took their seats at a neon-pink pedal bar.\nAn instruction?  No playback requests ‚Äú‚ÄòWAP‚Äô, specifically,‚Äù Ms. Gray said.  (The song was proactively banned, Mr. Mayer added, after attracting stares from ‚Äúdisgruntled‚Äù pedestrians.)\n\nSource Link",

It was under his leadership that Citi Field opened in 2009 with so many Dodgers-related touches ‚Äî including the enormous Jackie Robinson Rotunda ‚Äî that some Mets fans complained there were no more winks. in Brooklyn than at the Mets.\nThe connections would only continue, with Mike Piazza‚Äôs Hall of Fame career spanning the franchises and Justin Turner, a crucial member of the current Dodgers squad, having started his career in orange and blue.\nNow Steven A. Cohen, who tried to buy the Dodgers in 2012, is calling the Mets shots.  In his first public remarks after buying the Mets, he cited the Dodgers as a model of what he hoped the Mets would become.  He backed that up by pushing the Mets payroll near the top of the sport.\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to separate themselves from the pack,‚Äù said Valentine, who, in keeping with the connective tissue theme, was once married to a daughter of Ralph Branca, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  ‚ÄúKind of like the Dodgers tried to do when they left town, and the Yankees always have.‚Äù\nTwo of Hodges‚Äô adult children ‚Äî Gil Jr., 72, and Irene, 71 ‚Äî plan to be at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, along with two of Irene‚Äôs granddaughters and a cousin.

All of Brooklyn was crazy.  It was a wonderful moment.  My dad, I think, was a little scared to manage in New York.  He knew how good the fans were here, how much they loved him, and he just wanted to do the right thing for them.  He wanted to have a successful team.  And he did.‚Äù\n\nSource Link",

Along the way, he became involved in Cali‚Äôs underworld, joining a gang of kidnappers and getting into the drug trade.\nIn the 1970s, he and his brother helped organize a loose confederation of drug gangs into what became known as the Cali Cartel.  Less authoritarian than Mr. Escobar‚Äôs Medell√≠n Cartel, the Cali Confederacy cooperated on processing, shipping and distribution but otherwise gave its member gangs significant autonomy.\nYet, as the most successful members, the Rodr√≠guez brothers were first among equals.  Miguel acted as a sort of general manager for the cartel, overseeing day-to-day operations, while Gilberto was the strategic visionary.  They also set the tone for the organization: no flashy parties, no flamboyant displays of wealth, and above all no unnecessary violence.\nMr. Rodr√≠guez was also responsible for managing the cartel‚Äôs legitimate business interests.  He owned a chain of 400 pharmacies, a pharmaceutical laboratory, ranches, a radio network and America, a football club in Cali;  Mr. Rodr√≠guez has served on banking boards and mingled with Colombia‚Äôs financial elite.\nAt first, he and Mr. Escobar got along well;  Jorge Ochoa V√°zquez, a chef from Medell√≠n, accompanied Mr. Rodr√≠guez on a trip to Europe in 1984, where they sought to open up new markets.  (They were arrested in Spain for trafficking and extradited to Colombia, but Mr. Rodr√≠guez was found not guilty.)\nSoon, however, the relationship between the two cartels soured.  Apart from rivalries in North American markets, they disagreed on how to fight back when, in the late 1980s, the Colombian government launched a campaign to stamp out drug trafficking.\nMr. Escobar preferred war and, over a period of five years, killed hundreds of police officers, politicians, lawyers and journalists.  Mr. Rodr√≠guez hesitated, preferring to watch his two main threats tear apart from the sidelines.\n\nSource Link",

Since Friday, the websites of the programs of the sister cities of Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.\n\n\nMany U.S. municipalities have sister city relationships in multiple countries.  Although partnerships can include commercial and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local non-profit organizations.\nBut Mr Zelensky, who spoke to mayors 100 days after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia any extra credibility.\n‚Äù Do not apologize ;  don‚Äôt have relations with Russia,‚Äù said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech was applauded by mayors and city workers who had gathered in Reno, Nevada.  ‚ÄúAnd please don‚Äôt let those who have become murderers call your cities their sister cities.  ‚Äù\nPortland officials referenced a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners.  Officials from other U.S. cities named by Mr. Zelensky did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSource Link",
