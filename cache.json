          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r The Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study (HKIAS) at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) continues to connect scholars around the globe, allowing them to explore interdisciplinary ideas and address real-world issues. \r \r The most recent HKIAS Distinguished Lecture Series on Electronics and Photonics, held in March and April, was  supported in part by Kwang Hua Educational Foundation. The discussion topics covered nanotechnology, antenna design, 6G networks and much more, with five leading scientists outlining the latest research and potential applications of breakthrough technologies. The series attracted an international audience of over 2,000 scholars and guests. \r  \r \r The power of plasmonic biosensors\r \r \r \r Nanotechnology and its biosensor applications are becoming ever more prevalent in the field of biomedical microsystems. \r \r Kicking things off on March 1, Professor Stella W. Pang, Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Director of the Centre for Biosystems, Neuroscience, and Nanotechnology at CityU, spoke about “Nanotechnology for High-Performance Devices and Sensors”.   \r \r Noting the increased use of plasmonic sensors, she explained the ability of nanoimprint technology “to generate a large area of nanostructures within a few seconds”, showing high reproducibility and throughput. The novel 3D multiple layer plasmonic biosensors exhibit enhanced electric fields and a much higher sensitivity. This made it possible to detect lung cancer A549 live cells and nanoscale DNAs at very low concentrations by monitoring the highly sensitive resonance peak shift. \r \r Also, hybrid coupling of plasmonic and photonic crystal modes leads to a record high sensitivity of 1376 nm/refractive index unit. “Combining these biosensors with 3D engineered platforms, we can separate cancer cells from normal cells for identification, which will further improve the sensitivity such that cancer patients could be diagnosed at a much earlier stage, potentially saving millions of lives,”…",

Following a deadly crackdown by the Burmese army in 2017, some 740,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, where they were settled in the southern town of Cox’s Bazar.

In December 2020, the Bangladeshi government decided to relocate some of the Rohingya refugees to a remote island in the Bay of Bengal.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) was one of several lawmakers who wrote to the Biden administration in September demanding an end to the embargo on Russian ammunition imports.\n\"The group sent a letter dated Sept. 3 to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen accusing the administration of using the sanctions as a means to enact gun control measures and arguing that it would exacerbate a shortage of ammunition,\" said the report. \"'Wholesalers, retailers, small businesses, gun owners, and shooting sportsmen rely on ammunition imported from Russia and are rightfully concerned that this is an attempt at gun control,' the lawmakers wrote in the letter.\"\nThe sanctions were first imposed in response to the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok. He survived this attempt but was imprisoned on dubious charges upon returning to Russia.\n'Two weeks before the letter was sent, the lobbying arm of the NRA wrote about the sanctions, calling it an 'overreach' and 'crusade against law-abiding gun owners' by the Biden administration,\" said the report. \"The letter mirrors the same points the NRA made in its article. The organization wrote that it is exploring all of its legislative, legal and policy options to block the policy.\"\nIN OTHER NEWS: Retired federal agent may have known of racist Buffalo shooter's plans to massacre supermarket: report\nOther Republican lawmakers who signed the letter include Caucus Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY), and far-right Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Lauren Boebert (R-CO).\nThis comes despite the fact that Cruz has publicly demanded that the Biden administration sanction Russia more harshly as the Ukraine invasion has unfolded. He spearheaded a legislative effort to sanction the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which the administration held off on to maintain good relations with Germany. This became moot after Germany canceled the project itself.",

They involved one man who is now in his 40s and two men now in their 30s. \"The CPS has authorised criminal charges against Kevin Spacey, 62, for four counts of sexual assault against three men,\" Rosem...",

As per the nephew’s account, he told officers that Santos needed the medication and that his uncle 'didn’t resist.'\"\nBrazilian Federal Police dispute this story, claiming that Santos \"actively resisted\" and that they only resorted to a gas grenade after \"instruments of lesser offensive potential\" failed to subdue him.\nBrazil has rampant rates of police violence, particularly against Black civilians. According to The Washington Post, the incident has already sparked protests in Santos' hometown.\nAll of this comes as Brazil's presidential election is scheduled for October, where right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, notorious for his anti-Black remarks, is struggling in polls against former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\nYou can watch the video here.",

And this week at the World Economic Forum, someone forced me to make the connection between the safety of our children in a country flooded with weapons and the safety of our children on a warmer planet.\nIt was Al Gore, the former vice president, who drew a straight line between gun politics and climate politics.  He spoke with the conviction of a man who knows American politics inside out, and he spoke with anger and grief.  And I felt this terror inside, this question that I try to keep at bay in times like this, when I have to stay focused on something else: is my child safe there? schoo…",

          "description": "“If you swim at the same pace every day,” Ms. Lepinski said, “you won’t get as much benefit.”  On the one hand, she added, interval training is more fun.  “And two, that challenges your heart a little better.”\nMr. Ksebati and Ms. Lepinski said a good beginner or intermediate workout is 1,000 to 1,500 meters, or 20 to 30 laps, which should take around half an hour.  Start with a short warm-up — maybe a 4×50 at an easy pace — to get your heart rate up.  You can mix up different strokes, do breaststroke or backstroke rather than freestyle for some variety.  Then do a 4×25 using a plank to activate your legs.\nNext comes the main set, or most of your workout.  If you’re working on speed, do 8×50 (eight rounds with a break after each) at a brisk pace.  If you want to increase your endurance, try a moderately paced ladder, going up and down the length of your intervals: 1×50, 1×100, 1×200, 1×100, 1×50.\nFinally comes the return to calm, another 4×50 swim at a relaxed pace.  You can take a longer break – one or two minutes – between the warm-up, the main series and the cool-down.\nIt’s a bit confusing at first, but once you get the lingo down, you can follow almost any swim workout.  Want even more structure or a goal to achieve?  Apps like MySwimPro provide personalized workout plans, or you can find your local American masters swimmers crew.  (In the swimming world, “masters” simply means adult.)\nAbove all, enjoy the process.  For many swimmers, the water isn’t just a place to train, it’s also a sanctuary.  “It’s hard to think about the stress of the world when you’re wondering, ‘When is my next breath?  Where is the end of the pool?  What platform am I on?  said Ms. Lepinski.  “When you slip under water, the world goes away.”\n\nSource Link",

At 5-foot-9, Gauff is about the average height of top players these days, but she has long legs.  This can help her cover a lot of ground in a few quick steps, but it can make balls that sit low on grass and hard courts a little more difficult for her.\nIf there was a common thread running through Gauff’s first three matches, it was how often she was well placed.  The balls hit the clay and bounce right into her strike zone, giving her a series of belt-high fastballs she can play on, while taking advantage of the extra split second the clay gives her to put her feet or slide into position.\nAlways aggressive and on the hunt for forehands, she will inevitably make her share of mistakes, but so far she has hit more winners than unforced errors, which is always a good sign for any player.  She also rarely appeared unbalanced.\n“I really like sliding,” she said.  “I think it helps me recover faster after I reach the ball. Then also, I mean, I play pretty hard on my forehand, so I think the clay bounces the ball even higher.\nFor her part, Anisimova, 20, also spent most of her childhood in Florida, but she said she became more comfortable on clay largely by playing numerous junior tournaments in the Latin American countries, where red clay is also much more common than her.  is in the United States.\nAnisimova is a dangerous returner, capable of punishing slower serves, especially with her near-death backhand.  She also knows that her footwork and movement may be the weakest part of her still-developing game, and longer points on clay inevitably require her to cover more ground.  Clay makes his weakness a little less weak. \n“It gives me more time,” she said of clay after her victory over Muchova.  “Hard courts can sometimes be a bit too fast.”\n\nSource Link",

First, she said she would consider appealing the verdict (with taxpayers’ money).  She does not seem to grasp that racism is pervasive in all American institutions.  No matter how well-meaning European Americans are, change will never happen without this fundamental recognition.  The court’s decision is an invitation, a mandate, to review the policy and make amends.  Let the judgment be an opportunity for change, not hunkering down with secure blinders.  Second, alleging that he lied under oath, Wedegartner discharged the white police officer who testified on behalf of the black officer who brought the case.  And she confined him to his house during working hours!  Is she judge, prosecutor and jury?

But income is not keeping up with spending or rising prices: after-tax income rose 0.3% in April from the previous month and remained flat after controlling for inflation.\nAs a result, Americans are fueling their …",

          "description": "More importantly, though, it negated nearly all of the reviews.  It was instructive, for example, to read most Madrid media accounts of the Mbappé deal.  Rather than a defeat for Madrid, Mbappé’s decision was presented as that of a mercenary and a traitor, a defector who gave his word to Pérez and then betrayed him.\nMbappé’s family were so distressed by this depiction that his mother decided to correct it publicly, claiming on Twitter that her son had never ‘gave his word’ to Real Madrid.\nThat he chose ‘El Chiringuito’ for his first appearance to discuss Super League was no accident either.  The show regularly features prominent Madrid supporters journalists known to burst into tears over the club’s successes, or rail against those – Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard – who are deemed to have brought dishonor to the club.\nThe spectacle is not, in this, an outlier.  Pérez oversees a vast network of soft news media, dependent not only on his grace and favor for information and access, but also intimidated by the breadth and weight of his business interests.  Pérez always claimed he was only powerful because he was Real Madrid president, but that’s not entirely true.  It is also powerful in many other ways.\nThis allowed him to lead Real Madrid as he sees fit.  Despite its size, the club’s hierarchy is relatively tight, with many recruitment decisions overseen by Pérez;  its general manager, José Ángel Sanchez;  and his chief scout, Juni Calafat.  Real Madrid is, in that sense, something of an aberration, almost a throwback to a time when most of its peers have diversified and deepened their personnel.\nPérez would say, of course, that it works: five Champions League finals in nine years is all the proof he needs.  This is perhaps his greatest gift.  No matter what he does, no matter how unlikely it seems, Pérez has a remarkable ability to emerge triumphant.\nThis may have been the year that destabilized the kingdom he so painstakingly built.  Rather, it could turn out to be the year that cemented him for good.\n\nSource Link",
