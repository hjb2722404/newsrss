He added: “I don’t know if it’s now.”\nAs Election Day approached, the rhetoric heated up.  Campaign placards on both sides have been stolen or destroyed, according to police and organizers.  In the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, vandals target a Catholic church this month, splashing buildings and a statue of Mary with red paint, an episode that police have linked to the abortion debate.\nTwice in the past few weeks someone tore down signs supporting the amendment at Faith Baptist Church in Salina, Kansas, pastor Jesse Rowland said.  A third sign has been placed in the cemetery.\n“It’s a bit more of trench warfare – everyone is entrenched on one side or the other,” Mr Rowland said.  “No one is talking, really, from what I’ve observed.”\n\nSource Link",

The CIA Director estimated as many as 60,000 Russians had been killed or wounded since February.

In the first installment, we looked at the chances of a stalemate and a partial Russian victory.

Between the two prospects, this analysis reveals that Moscow has a chance of defeating Ukraine while Kyiv has virtually no chance of defeating Russia. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: What is note-worthy in the above post is the admission that Ukraine is losing 1,000 soldiers a day (killed and wounded), and that most of its best fighters have now been eliminated.
