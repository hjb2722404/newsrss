It also has a presence in many other countries, including Syria or Mali. \nAnd it's not the only Russian private military company either. Over the past few years, there has been an increase in these kinds of groups, also known as PMCs, in Russia, a report from the US-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says. \nIt is not always possible to accurately track the exact activities of the Wagner Group, headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, and other PMCs because they allegedly act independently of the Russian government and conventional military forces.

          "description": "\"The criminal case against Prigozhin will be dropped, he himself will go to Belarus\" - Peskov https://t.co/NkNh9VjSu9 pic.twitter.com/1AYrBj8mxW\n— Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) June 24, 2023\n  \nWNU Editor: I do not think Prigozhin's exile to Belarus is going to last long. But he had no choice. I know that outside of Moscow there is a huge military base with tens of thousands of soldiers present with heavy armor, and this morning they were all ordered out of their base and deployed to destroy Prigozhin's approaching convoy at all costs. And in Rostov where Prigozhin was holed up, a massive Chechen force with Russian special forces were approaching the city to attack and evict him out of the military base that he was in. \nBottom line. Receiving little if any public support and no support from any Russian military unit Prigozhin had to cut a deal. \nSo what is next? \nPrigozhin will be exiled to Belarus, but he will be closely watched and his movements and communications will be severely restricted. \nThe Wagner fighters who initially refused to participate in Prigozhin's \"march\" will sign contracts with the Defense Ministry. \nThere will be no changes in the Russian Ministry of Defense as demanded by Prigozhin. \nBelarus President Lukashenko is the big winner in this crisis. \nThis is a big wake-up call for Putin. \nThe vast majority of Russians understand why this war is being fought, and they support it. But they are not supporting the strategy on how to fight it. My fear is that Putin, in order to placate the growing impatience with the pace of the war, is going to significantly escalate the war that will include the use of strategic bombers as well as expanding what targets the Russian military will be permitted to destroy.",
