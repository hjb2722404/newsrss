His plea for an immediate ceasefire on behalf of a hospital under siege and its 700 critically injured and ill patients, 36 premature babies, 400 staff, and the 2000 vulnerable civilians. These people sheltering within the hospital and its garden were heard as far away as Afghanistan yet totally ignored where it counted most- with the men in Israel's war cabinet and Washington; they were busy executing and aiding an illegal war of choice on an unarmed, defenseless hospital and one of the poorest and densely populated places in the world.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/11/22/35364\">Read the full story, “The Cries of Gaza Reach Afghanistan”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>",

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who infamously peddled conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that were concocted by a woman who believes she can talk with the wind, is now floating wild conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19.\nWhile there is still some debate over whether COVID-19 may have originated from a viral research lab in the city of Wuhan, Bartiromo on Monday took things several steps farther — and suggested that the virus was part of a deliberate plot to bring down former President Donald Trump.\nDuring an interview with Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Bartiromo openly asked, \"Is there a chance that China released this virus on America intentionally?\"\nIn fact, there is no evidence of a Chinese plot to deliberately release a virus that spread all across the globe, not just in the United States, and that wound up killing millions of people, including an unquantified number of Chinese citizens.\nALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.\nRegardless, Bartiromo went on to say that the goal of the Chinese government may have been to \"disrupt\" America to \"get Donald Trump out, get your man in there, Joe Biden.\"\nWenstrup didn't explicitly endorse Bartiromo's theory, although he did leave open the possibility that the virus was released \"accidentally.\"\nWatch the video below or at this link.\n\n\n\n\n —  (@)",

They were noisy and easy to track. The Chinese military, meanwhile, struggled to detect America’s ultraquiet submarines. \nNow, China is narrowing one of the biggest gaps separating the U.S. and Chinese militaries as it makes advances in its submarine technology and undersea detection capabilities, with major implications for American military planning for a potential conflict over Taiwan. \nEarly this year, China put to sea a nuclear-powered attack submarine with a pump-jet propulsion system instead of a propeller, satellite imagery showed. It was the first time noise-reducing technology used on the latest American submarines had been seen on a Chinese submarine. \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The U.S. still is ahead (see below).
