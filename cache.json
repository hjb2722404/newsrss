          "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Monday that they would submit a bill next week to dissolve the country's parliament, which if passed would trigger new elections with Lapid serving as caretaker prime minister. \n\"After exhausting all efforts to stabilize the coalition, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and... (Foreign Minister) Yair Lapid have decided to submit a bill\" dissolving parliament \"next week\", the two leading Israeli coalition partners said in a statement. Lapid and Bennett were expected to issue statements at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)\nThey also said that if the bill is approved, Lapid will take over as premier of a caretaker government. \nShould that eventuate, it would be Lapid who would host US President Joe Biden during his scheduled visit to Israel next month.\nThe ideologically divided eight-party alliance was forged one year ago and includes religious nationalists, like Bennett, Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party, left-wingers and, for the first time in Israeli history, lawmakers from an Arab Islamist party.\nBut the coalition, cobbled together to end the tenure of divisive leader Benjamin Netanyahu, was under threat from its inception. It lost its majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament in April when a member of Bennett's Yamina party announced her departure.\nRecent divisions over the renewal of a measure that allows Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank to live under Israeli law caused fresh friction, with some left-wingers refusing to back it.\nThat was anathema to hawks in the alliance, notably Justice Minister Gideon Saar, who reject any notion that West Bank settlers live outside Israel.\nThe Netanyahu-led opposition had warned it would submit its own bill to dissolve parliament on Wednesday but Bennett and Lapid appear to have moved to pre-empt that opposition move.\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP and REUTERS)",

          "description": "The daughter of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has said she is concerned about her father's welfare after his transfer to a penal camp where conditions are tougher.\n\"No one notified the attorneys or the family about this transfer,\" Dasha Navalnaya told US broadcaster CNN on Monday.\n\"It is very concerning,\" she said. She said the conditions where he is now are very different from those people imagine in usual prisons. \"This is one of the most dangerous and famous high security prisons in Russia, known for torturing and murdering the inmates,\" she said.\n\"They fenced off a separate barrack in the area to really create a prison within the prison so that he can't speak publicly and isolate him from any information,\" she said, calling this \"purely psychological torture.\"\nNavalny, one of the most prominent critics of the Kremlin, was in quarantine after being transferred to penal colony 6 in Melekhovo near the city of Kovrov, he said last week on Instagram.\nThe camp has particularly harsh detention conditions and is located about 150 kilometres further away from the Pokrov penal colony, or some 260 kilometres north-east of Moscow.\nAt the time, his aide said she feared for his life. Navalny narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in August 2020, for which he blames Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNavalny has made many enemies with his revelations about corruption and abuse of power in the Russian state apparatus.\nIn May, a court confirmed Navalny's nine-year prison sentence for fraud. This made the transfer to a penal camp with harsher detention rules legally binding.",

She told him to stop saying such things or else the neighbors might think he was crazy.\nWhen he was 14, he moved into a small room in his paternal grandmother’s house in the chaotic post-colonial city of Calcutta so he could attend a good high school.

The child of a wealthy Italian merchant, he had a playboy youth in the 12th century, went to war and spent a year in captivity.  He had mystical visions, stole from his disapproving father to give to the church, and dedicated himself to a life of poverty in imitation of Christ, founding a religious order.  He saw God in nature, thanking the sun, preaching to the birds – setting an example of equality and ecology followed by many, including the current pope.\nVery little of this drama fits into “God’s Fool“, the dance theater work on Francis which opened Thursday at La MaMa’s Ellen Stewart Theater.

(But you should make this salmon tonight.)\nI was most excited for the collar, a fat cut that comes from between the gills and the head.  Jump at the chance to cook one, if you can get it from your fishmonger or someone who fishes offshore.  No recipe required: Broil, broil or roast under a light sprinkle of salt until soft and shiny, perfect for picking with chopsticks or a …",

Gleb Garanich / Reuters \nDmytro Kuleba, Foreign Affairs: How Ukraine Will Win  \nKyiv’s Theory of Victory \nAs Russia’s all-out war of aggression in Ukraine drags on for a fourth consecutive month, calls for dangerous deals are getting louder. As fatigue grows and attention wanders, more and more Kremlin-leaning commentators are proposing to sell out Ukraine for the sake of peace and economic stability in their own countries. Although they may pose as pacifists or realists, they are better understood as enablers of Russian imperialism and war crimes. \nIt is only natural that people and governments lose interest in conflicts as they drag on. It’s a process that has played out many times throughout history. The world stopped paying attention to the war in Libya after former leader Muammar al-Qaddafi was toppled from power, in 2011. It disengaged from Syria, Yemen, and other ongoing conflicts that once generated front-page news. And as I know well, the rest of the world lost interest in Ukraine after 2015, even as we continued to fight Russian forces for control over the eastern part of the country.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This plan is based on the hope that the West will overwhelmingly support Ukraine in the war.",

REUTERS/Gleb Garanich   \nMoon of Alabama: Ukraine - The West's Response As It Meets With Reality \nThis morning I watched an hour long discussion (vid) by 'experts' at the Center for Strategic & International Studies about assessing Russia's war in Ukraine. I have to say that these folks know nothing that is relevant. They seem to have never heard of Sun Tsu's dictum 'Know your enemy': \n Sun Tzu says, “To know your enemy, you must become your enemy,” but how do you become your enemy? You need to put yourself in the place of your enemy so you can predict his actions.\nNot once did the CSIS people consider the view of Russia or its real intent. They talk about this or that U.S. option but do not even once consider how the other side would react to it. \nOne of the CSIS 'experts' says that Russia had planned to take Kiev but failed. Take Kiev with what? There were some 20-30.000 Russian soldiers near Kiev which has some 3 million inhabitants. Historically one needs one soldier for every 40 civilians to occupy a city or country after the fighting is mostly over. Russia would have needed more than two and a half times the number of troops it had around Kiev to take and hold the city. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Another good review from the Moon of Alabama on the Russia - Ukraine war that you will not get from any Western news outlet.",
