          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r Twenty-five years since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, The Hong Kong Jockey Club has remained committed to giving back to society and promoting community development. Not only does the Club support charities, but it also organises a wide range of fun activities for children and the young at heart, the latest of which is the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour. \r \r Inspired by the ancient Chinese mythical animal ‘Dragon Horse’, Drago Cavallo is a contemporary expression of Chinese culture and a symbol of inspiration, which will lead a trail of positivity around Hong Kong. The adorable creature is designed by renowned artist Simon Ma.  \r \r On July 3, Club Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, Simon Ma, Po Leung Kuk Chairman Dr Daniel Chan, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Chairman Philip Ma and the talented students whose artwork adorns the special anniversary Drago Cavallo sculptures, took part in the opening ceremony of the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour in Tai Kwun. \r \r \r \r The exhibition showcases 43 exhibits from the Drago Cavallo collection until July 10. Visitors can also experience the AR scavenger hunt and other immersive digital experiences on the spot. The roving exhibition will then be held in the East Coast Park Precinct, Sha Tin Town Hall Plaza, the Hong Kong Museum of Art and other surprising locations until November. \r \r \r \r “Drago Cavallo is a wonderful initiative for our younger generation, providing them with a platform to express themselves and showcase their creativity. I would like to thank Simon Ma for initiating this meaningful programme and all partners for their collaboration. Creativity is key to innovation, and innovation is vital to maintaining Hong Kong’s competitive edge. This is why continuous development is one of the Club’s core values,” said Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges. \r \r “This art showcase is just one of many programmes the Club is proud to support through its ‘With You. Now. Always.’…",

John Kasich about the latest developments from the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nKasich also served nine terms in Congress, rising to chair the Budget Committee before he vacated his seat to unsuccessfully run for president in 2000.\n\"Gov. Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?\" Blitzer asked.\n \"Oh yeah. he's taking on water,\" Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.\n\"And he's shrinking,\" he continued. \"You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting.\"\n\"And I feel that he's melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, 'You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.' The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman's testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath,\" he said. \"If they don't agree with her story, with what she's been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath.\"\n\"The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It's hard for me to believe in our country we would've had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much. I never felt he was fit for the office and it's all proven out to be true, unfortunately,\" he said.\nWatch:\n\n\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nwww.youtube.com",

We're going to use every appeal avenue.\" \nAssange is wanted to face trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010, related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.\nHe could face decades in jail if found guilty, but supporters portray him as a martyr to press freedom after he was taken into UK custody following a years-long stay in Ecuador's embassy.\n\"He's been in prison for telling the truth,\" supporter Gloria Wildman, 79, told AFP at Friday's protest.\n\"If Julian Assange is not free, neither are we, none of us is free,\" she said.",

State.  A spokeswoman for Walmart, which has 1.7 million employees in the United States, said the company regularly reviews its benefits based on employee demand, and that the company is “now reviewing the evolution federal and state landscape” when considering its offerings.  The rest of the companies listed did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n“We are working thoughtfully and diligently to find the best path forward, guided by our desire to support our associates, all of our associates,” Doug McMillon, Walmart chief executive, wrote in a memo to staff Friday.\nAmazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer after Walmart, said it would cover out-of-state abortion travel for its employees, most of whom are hourly workers.  But that perk applies to employees of its healthcare plan, not the contractors who make up a substantial part of its workforce, like its vast network of delivery drivers.\nAs the list of companies covering abortion-related travel grows, some workers wonder why their employers won’t do the same.  Isabela Burrows, 19, who works at a PetSmart in Howell, Michigan, learned that Roe v.  Wade had been knocked down by a client last week and was frustrated that her company had said nothing.  Michigan has an abortion ban that has been blocked in court and which Democratic leaders have said they will not enforce.\n\nSource Link",
