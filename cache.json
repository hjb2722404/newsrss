But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.\n\"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids,\" said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.\nThe protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.\nNational police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.\nThe now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and \"will not yield to any political pressure on the matter\".\nNetanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.\n\"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister',\" said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.\n(Writing by Dan Williams; editing by John Stonestreet)",

          "description": "Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley apparently won't be getting the vote of at least one Iowa man who wants no part of helping Ukraine beat back Russia's year-long military invasion.\nAs reported by CBS News' Robert Costa, an unidentified man stood up and began shouting when Haley, during an appearance in Iowa with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a \"bigger war\" in the future.\nThe man angrily shouted that he was \"done\" with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.\nAccording to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.\nREAD MORE: The View's audience bursts out laughing as Trump's words come back to haunt him\nThe issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.\nTraditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while \"America First\" Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.",
