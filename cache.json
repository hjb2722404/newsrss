I am really furious on behalf of my kids,\" said protest organizer Lorna Powell, 37.\n\"Instead of being a climate leader and acting in the right way, he's decided that he is going to use it as a political game to try and stoke a culture war,\" she added.\nDowning Street insists the policy is essential to ensure Britain's domestic energy security, and that it can still meet its 2050 net zero goals.",

This places her at second in command within the State Department, second only to Tony Blinken. \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: I see the elevation of Victoria Nuland to the second top post in the US State Department as a sign that the Biden administration have not given up on their dream of achieving regime change in Russia. \nAs for the appointment of Gen. Charles Q. Brown to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. This is a signal that the Pentagon is going to be focused on what they see is the emerging threat of China.",

Orano, France's state-controlled nuclear fuel producer, is continuing its activities in Niger and monitoring the situation, a company spokesperson said in a statement emailed to POLITICO, stressing that \"our priority is to maintain the safety of our employees in the country.\" \nThe French government and energy experts were quick to stress that the tensions will not have any immediate impact on France's needs for uranium as extraction is continuing and, should it stop, existing stocks could still cover approximately two years.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Niger coup raises questions about uranium dependence (AFP).\n\n \nWNU Editor: The official line is there is nothing to worry about and they are probably right .... EU sees 'no immediate risks' if Niger cuts uranium supplies (Reuters). But Niger is one of the world's largest producers of uranium, and if this export ban continues prices are going to increase even more than the current spike in prices .... Uranium price ticks up after Niger coup, more gains expected (Reuters).",
