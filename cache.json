An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.\nHis attorney said that he had been \"eaten alive.\"\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates \"do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.\" \n“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,\" she said. \nClarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a \"racial justice issue,\" citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail. \nRead the full report at The Washington Post.",
