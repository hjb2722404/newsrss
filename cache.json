Many still have no access to power or the internet.\nHundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.\nTaking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.\nRiver catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.\n\"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,\" Sullivan said.\nMore than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.\nA La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",

She said the truck was on its way to another exhibit 370 miles away at the Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena.\nBut in circumstances that have not been made public, the merchandise was taken from the truck near Los Angeles early Monday, said Brink’s spokeswoman Dana Callahan.\n\n\nThe value of the stolen merchandise, which included several gold and diamond necklaces, was not immediately clear.  It was also unclear how many pieces had been taken.\n\n\nOne of the jewelers, who requested anonymity for security reasons given the expensive jewelry he handles, estimated the total value of what was stolen at between $20 million and $50 million.  Ms. Callahan said it was less than $10 million.\n“Based on information customers provided to us prior to shipping their items, the total value of missing items is less than $10 million,” Brink’s said in a statement.  “We are working with law enforcement and will fully reimburse our customers for the value of their assets that were stolen, in accordance with the terms of our contract.”\nThe jeweler said Brink’s was not transparent with jewelry owners and many fundamental questions about the loss remained unanswered.\nNeither authorities nor Brink’s released details of what happened, including the location of the theft and whether anyone was injured.\n\n\nA spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency was working with local authorities but could not provide more information.  In its statement, Brink’s called the episode “a loss incident.”\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "The fastest inflation in four decades has Americans feeling austere about the economy, even as their own finances have so far held up relatively well.\nJust 10% of registered voters say the U.S. economy is “good” or “great,” according to a New York Times/Siena College poll — a remarkable degree of pessimism at a time when wages are rising and the the unemployment rate is near its lowest level in 50 years.  But the rapidly rising cost of food, gasoline and other necessities is nullifying wage increases and eroding living standards.\n\n\nAmericans’ bleak outlook is bad news for President Biden and congressional Democrats heading into this fall’s midterm elections, given that 78% of voters say inflation will be “extremely high” when they will go to the polls.\n\n\nIt could also be bad news for the e…",

He is loud and indiscreet, converses on the phone, is often away from the office, and can be hostile and defiant towards shareholders and guests.  What recourse do shareholders have?  Can we withhold the part of the interview that goes towards his salary if his performance does not improve?\nA: You cannot suspend maintenance because a building employee does not perform their duties according to your expectations.\n\n\nYour grievances may be justified, but if all of a co-op’s shareholders withheld maintenance because they were dissatisfied with some aspect of the service, the building wouldn’t be able to function properly.\nWhat bothers one person may no…",

How True Is That? \nJEDDAH, Saudi Arabia — As President Biden told the tale, it sounded pretty dramatic. \nAfter meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, on Friday for the first time since taking office, the president insisted that he had pointedly blamed him for the murder of the columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n“He basically said that he was not personally responsible for it,” Mr. Biden recounted to reporters. “I indicated that I thought he was.” \nThe only hitch? That’s not the way it happened, according to Saudi officials. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, who was present for the encounter, told reporters that he had not heard the president blame the crown prince. \n Read more ....   \nWNU Editor: Even the New York Times in the above post admits that Mr. Biden is by nature a storyteller with a penchant for embellishment. \nI think the Khashoggi issue was raised, but it was low key and brief.

If President Biden was that confrontational, the Saudi would be really pissed right now, and we will all be knowing about it.",

It was more listening to friends and family on what they are going through right now in Ukraine. \nSighhh ... it has been a draining day. But I should not complain. I am in Canada where I am safe. \nAs for the above video report. Kudos to Dima at the Military Summary YouTube channel spending his day trying to understand the military situation on the ground by compiling both Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministry briefings into something that is meaningful. No one has come close to doing what he is doing, including all those high-paid retired Generals giving their 5 minute analysis on TV that is proven wrong 2 weeks later. \nSome other interesting news that I picked up today. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has been making some remarks that is raising a few eyebrows. One .... he says he was misquoted when he said Ukraine will soon have a million soldiers. Reason being that his English is not good. He instead expects something like 700,000 soldiers. \nAnd two .... he has been quoted as saying that the Ukraine military has already suffered 100,000 casualties since the start of the war?!?!?!? I have been trying to find other Ukrainian media and government outlets to verify this casualty number, but no luck so far.\n\nRussian media is saying that they have already destroyed a number of US supplied HIMARS systems, and that the Russian military advance continues. I am always skeptical of these reports, but I have noticed a reduction in reports of long range artillery strikes by Ukraine in the past few days.",
