By 5 a.m. (0900 GMT) it was around 30 miles (50 km) north-northwest of Bluefields.\nThe hurricane was expected to gradually weaken as it crosses Nicaragua, emerging over the eastern Pacific by Sunday night. It was forecast to move near or along the Pacific coasts of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala on Monday and Monday night, the NHC said.\n\"Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides possible from heavy rains over Central America and Southern Mexico through early next week,\" the center said.\n(Writing by Frances Kerry; editing by Barbara Lewis)",

          "description": "Republicans have ramped up calls to impeach Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after an email circulated indicating he was notified that claims of border patrol agents whipping migrants was false.\n\nLast September images from Del Rio circulated showing border patrol agents on horseback rounding up migrants who had illegally crossed the border.\n\nThose images looked as if agents were whipping migrants, however the photographer later confirmed it was misconstrued.\n\nAn email obtained from September last year by Fox News’ Bill Melugin revealed Secretary Mayorkas was told this narrative was fake – two and a half hours before he fronted the media where he condemned his own border patrol agents.\nRepublicans have now called for him to be impeached for failing to defend agents.\n\n“Alejandro Mayorkas defamed his own employees in order to score political points.  He has violated his oath of office and lied to the American people with a straight face. His career should be over,” Republican Andy Biggs tweeted.",

          "description": "For high school teacher and mother Jennifer Shaffer, time and sleep are two precious assets.  So with the end of DST    approaching, the busy mother says she fears changing the clock. \n“It’s definitely going to mess us up and mess us up over the next few days, even a week,” Shaffer told CBS News. \nShe is not alone.  according to one vote conducted by Monmouth University, six out of 10 Americans said they would rather make daylight saving time permanent — abandoning the practice of changing the clock twice a year created during World War I to save energy.\n\nTurning our clocks back and forth may soon be a thing of the past – if a few lawmakers get their way.\nThis year, Congress brought the issue into the spotlight when the House energy committee heard testimony at a formal hearing about how changing the clock is linked to increased risk of depression, stroke and sleep disorders.  According to National Children’s Hospital sleep specialist Dr.  Tyish Hall Brown, changing watches can have an impact on the body.\n“We have a kind of internal rhythm to our bodies and our health,” Brown said.  “And every time we move forward or backward, that too has to adjust.”\nIn March, the US Senate unanimously legislation passed    without warning to make DST permanent starting in 2023, if the US House and President agree.\nMichigan Congressman Fred Upton said the effort will likely fall short in the House, in part because some people in the western section of the time zones say they are concerned that permanent daylight saving time could make mornings too dark and late. \n“Not only would [school buses] running in the dark, the kids would probably be in the second or third hour while it was still dark,” he said. \nNearly 15 years ago, Upton championed an energy-saving law that extended DST    even later in November. \n“Particularly with global warming, climate change is real,” he said.  “Why not take advantage of this extra hour of sunlight?”\n    \n      \nSource Link",

My father was the first thing he said to our family, you know? I love fighting for this country. We use a surprising number of arrows, but we love red, white and blue. Well, I sure hope my dad does it again. \nI think he is the best president this country has ever had. He is willing to fight. No other Republican is willing to fight and I think he fundamentally changed the party. Republicans are no longer Republicans. This is the Trump Party.\nRepublicans are in a tight House race across the country. Swing district candidates are trying to pretend Donald Trump doesn’t exist, and here’s Eric Trump reminding America that voting for any Republican on the 2022 ballot is as good as voting for Donald Trump.\nRepublicans likely won’t win control of the Senate, as Trump’s Senate roster is a massive failure.\nThe GOP needs Donald Trump to leave on Election Day. His presence in the midterms hurt Republican voters. Instead, Eric Trump is touching his father’s ego and reminding every voter in America that the Republican Party that was once the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan now belongs to Donald Trump.\n\n\nSource: Politicususa.com",

Warnock then told Walker he needed to explain why he wanted the higher price.  Herschel Walker says diab…",
