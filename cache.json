I would even say that for a majority of Americans it was not even on their top 10 issues of concern. \nThe debacle and surrender in Afghanistan. The war in Ukraine. Growing tensions with China. Worsening tensions with North Korea. The fracturing of the global order into multi-polar blocs that are hostile to US interests. The weaponization of the US dollar's status as the world's global reserve currency. All of these issues were not raised, debated, or discussed. \nWhat this means is that there will be no personnel changes or changes in policies when it comes to the Pentagon and national security issues, imposing financial and economic sanctions as a tool of US foreign policy, the war in Ukraine, and raising tensions against China.\nMy biggest worry is that there are probably some in the White House who will see the elections results as a green-light to double down on their policies. \nWhat this means is even more support and involvement, maybe even direct involvement, in the war in Ukraine. The weaponization of the dollar. A more aggressive posture against China. And an even more aggressive approach towards countries like Saudi Arabia to not divert away from the American sphere of influence as they try their best to distance themselves away from Washington DC (i.e. Saudi Crown Prince Salman meeting Chinese President Xi next month to foster closer ties).\nI do not see any lessening of tensions in 2023. In fact. I see it becoming far worse as the US does what it feels it must do to maintain its status as the world's global super-power.",

But even if they do lose the House, the Republican majority will be so small, maybe by a seat or two, that blocking the President's agenda will be challenge for the Republican leadership. \nWithin the Democrat party itself, the push to convince President Biden to not run in the 2024 Presidential race is going to fall silent. \nPresident Biden, at least publicly, has stated that he will run in 2024. Unless there is a change in his physical health by then, he and Kamala Harris will be on the ticket for 2024. \nAnd as to questions on President Biden's mental capacity to run in 2024. As John Fetterman's Senate victory in Pennsylvania has shown. Being mentally impaired after suffering a stroke and facing years of rehabilitation was not an obstacle for him to run for office and to win convincingly. \nSo what do I expect from the White House in the next two years?\nI expect the White House, with help from the media, to say that this election cycle validated President Biden's policies, and he has mandate to continue on. \nPolicy wise the White House and the Democrats in Congress are going to double down on their domestic agenda and policies.

Chrystia Freeland is more suitable for the post of the NATO chief according to some NATO officials. \nChrystia Freeland, the deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Canada could replace Jens Stoltenberg as a NATO secretary general unless his term is extended, an American newspaper reported on Friday, citing a US official familiar with the debate. With the tenure of NATO’s current chief, Jens Stoltenberg, scheduled to end next fall, who among the allies should replace him? Besides Chrystia Freeland, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Slovak President Zuzana Caputova, and ex-Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, who also was Croatia's ambassador to the US and an assistant secretary general for public diplomacy at NATO, are named as strong contenders from the European Union, according to the report.

Behind the scenes, the Treasury and State Departments have urged banking giants including JPMorgan and Citigroup to keep doing business with certain strategic Russian firms, according to people familiar with the situation.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Biden administration encourages Wall Street banks to keep doing business with certain strategic Russian firms, report says (Business Insider)  \nUpdate #2: White House privately asks US banks to work with Russia – Bloomberg (RT)   \nWNU Editor: Even if the report from Bloomberg is true, there is no way Russian companies and institutions are going to do business with US banks.",
