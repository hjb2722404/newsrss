          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r Twenty-five years since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, The Hong Kong Jockey Club has remained committed to giving back to society and promoting community development. Not only does the Club support charities, but it also organises a wide range of fun activities for children and the young at heart, the latest of which is the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour. \r \r Inspired by the ancient Chinese mythical animal ‘Dragon Horse’, Drago Cavallo is a contemporary expression of Chinese culture and a symbol of inspiration, which will lead a trail of positivity around Hong Kong. The adorable creature is designed by renowned artist Simon Ma.  \r \r On July 3, Club Chief Executive Officer Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, Simon Ma, Po Leung Kuk Chairman Dr Daniel Chan, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Chairman Philip Ma and the talented students whose artwork adorns the special anniversary Drago Cavallo sculptures, took part in the opening ceremony of the ‘Drago Cavallo. Travel Around Hong Kong’ tour in Tai Kwun. \r \r \r \r The exhibition showcases 43 exhibits from the Drago Cavallo collection until July 10. Visitors can also experience the AR scavenger hunt and other immersive digital experiences on the spot. The roving exhibition will then be held in the East Coast Park Precinct, Sha Tin Town Hall Plaza, the Hong Kong Museum of Art and other surprising locations until November. \r \r \r \r “Drago Cavallo is a wonderful initiative for our younger generation, providing them with a platform to express themselves and showcase their creativity. I would like to thank Simon Ma for initiating this meaningful programme and all partners for their collaboration. Creativity is key to innovation, and innovation is vital to maintaining Hong Kong’s competitive edge. This is why continuous development is one of the Club’s core values,” said Mr Engelbrecht-Bresges. \r \r “This art showcase is just one of many programmes the Club is proud to support through its ‘With You. Now. Always.’…",

Since then, the city's firefighters have been bringing water to Sloviansk's dwindling and beleaguered population, in an already dangerous environment.\n\n \n\nSloviank's water pumping and filtration plant to the east of the city was cut off in fighting, making repairs impossible. The Sloviank authorities make sure the firefighters know what's needed and where. Queues gather every day, but impatience is growing after a month in this situation. \"Tell the mayor we need two trucks for each building,\" said one resident. \"It's not enough; I have to come so far every day to get water.\"\n\n \n\nRussian forces may be on their way: After the fall of Lysychansk just over 70km east, Sloviansk lies directly in their path as the Russian offensive in the Donbas grinds on.",

It led foreign policy experts to fear that the invasion was part of a larger war of genocide.\nBy the end of May, Russian state TV was threatening to invade Poland. Now that the war has been going on for 131 days, a Daily Beast report cited Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko hinted that the next war will be against Europe as a whole. \n“The time has come for the forgetful Europe to give itself a moral cleansing,” Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state television's BelTA.\nLukashenko talked about fighting Nazis in World War II, known to Russians as the “Great Patriotic War,” and said that their efforts aren't over.\n IN OTHER NEWS…",

          "description": "While the United States Catholic bishops continue a debate over whether politicians should get communion, another group of bishops is working on making desperate deals with drug traffickers, Vice News said citing Mexican newspaper Milenio. \n“There is a need for a social pact,” said Bishop Sigifredo Noriega. “A pact where even the bad guys could have a say.”\nThe \"bad guys\" he's talking about are organized crime groups that have been increasing decades-long violence in Mexico. The Catholic church is estimated to have multiple billions of dollars but they're not about to use it for a holy war against the drug cartels in Central America. \nTwo priests were killed last month in church and they are searching for solutions. The assumption seems to be that giving them \"a say\" might persuade the narcos to work cooperatively within the community to traffick their drugs without so many murders. \nIN OTHER NEWS: Family says road rage shooting that was captured on video was racially motivated\n\"The bishop of Zacatecas suggested 'directly speaking' with members of organized crime,\" said the report. It explained, \"Zacatecas is one of Mexico’s states most affected by violence related to drug trafficking, and is leading in the ranking on murders this year.\"\n\nFather Javier Campos was 79 years old when he was murdered and Father Joaquín Mora was 80. Their deaths are said to be a result of drug boss José Noriel Portillo “El Chueco” (of the Sinaloa Cartel) chased a tourist guide into the church. The priests tried to protect the man but they were all three killed, said Chihuahua state authorities. They were then dumped two days later about 125 miles from the church. \n\"The murder of the Jesuit priests reinforces the call to examine the security strategy in Mexico, as we are experiencing a wave of historical violence: the number of murders so far this six-year term exceeds 122,000 people,\" the Archdiocese of Mexico said in an editorial.\nRead the full report at Vice News.",

          "description": "Britain's finance and health ministers resigned on Tuesday, in what looked to be the final blow for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's premiership after he had tried to apologize for the latest scandal to dog his administration.\nBoth finance minister Rishi Sunak and health minister Sajid Javid resigned in what appeared to be a choreographed release of letters to the prime minister, in which both took aim at his ability to run an administration that adhered to standards.\nThe resignations came as Johnson was apologising for what he said was a mistake for not realizing that a former minister in charge of pastoral care was unsuitable for a job in government after complaints of sexual misconduct were made against him.\nBoth had formerly publicly supported Johnson during months of scandal over his administration's conduct and a damning report into parties at his Downing Street office and residence that broke strict COVID-19 lockdown rules.\nSunak, who had reportedly clashed with the prime minister in private about spending, said: \"For me to step down as Chancellor while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other serious challenges is a decision that I have not taken lightly.\"\n\"However, the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously. I recognize this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning.\"\nJavid said many lawmakers and the public had lost confidence in Johnson's ability to govern in the national interest.\n\"I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership - and you have therefore lost my confidence too,\" Javid said in a letter to Johnson.\n(REUTERS)",

          "description": "Italy declared a state of emergency in five northern regions and announced emergency funds on Monday over a worsening drought that has plagued the Po Valley in recent weeks.\nThe cabinet approved a state of emergency in five regions—Friuli-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Piedmont and Veneto—until December 31, the government said in a statement that also announced a 36.5 million-euro ($39.5 million) fund to help those affected.\nItaly is facing an unusually early heatwave and a lack of rainfall, particularly in the northern agricultural Po Valley, which has been hit by its worst drought in 70 years.\nThe state of emergency provides “extraordinary means and powers” to help guarantee public safety, compensation for losses while seeking to guarantee normal living conditions for those in the area.\nAccording to the country’s largest agricultural union, Coldiretti, the drought threatens more than 30 percent of national agricultural production, and half of the farms in the Po Valley, where Parma ham is produced.\nLakes Maggiore and Garda were also hit by lower than normal water levels for this time of year, while further south the Tiber River, which runs through Rome, also dropped.\nThe Po represents the peninsula’s largest water reservoir, much of which is used by farmers.\nIn recent days, several municipalities have announced restrictions.\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning\nSubscribe\nVerona, a city of a quarter of a million people, has rationed the use of drinking water, while Milan has announced the closure of its decorative fountains.\nAnother consequence of the drought is that hydroelectric power production has fallen sharply.\nHydroelectric plants, mostly in the mountainous north of the country, account for nearly 20 percent of national energy production.\nThe announcement comes a day after at least seven people died after a glacier collapsed in the Italian Alps which Prime Minister Mario Draghi said was “without doubt” linked to global warming.\n(AFP)",

          "description": "The future of Team USA, regardless of what happens in Mexico, remains a bit of an incomplete picture.  Morgan, who scored twice on Monday, and Megan Rapinoe both received their first call-ups to the squad since October for the Concacaf event.  But Morgan, 33, is already defending his position against rising stars like Catarino Macario, who is currently out with a knee injury.  And young forwards like Mallory Pugh, Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman all play in the same position as Rapinoe, who turned 37 on Tuesday.\n“It’s not easy being a striker in the United States right now,” Andonovski said when he announced his Concacaf Championship roster.  “Obviously it’s great, but it’s not easy because the competition is getting bigger and bigger.\nSimilar battles are playing out on the pitch at every position, in every roster decision, as the United States go from a roster that has taken them to two consecutive World Cup titles to one that could take it to one. third against regional rivals like Canada, the reigning Olympic gold medalistand European contenders like Sweden, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and England – among others – who contest the European championship this month.\nThe Americans’ remaining group stage schedule includes matches against Jamaica (Thursday) and Mexico (Monday).  Canada leads Group B, which includes Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Panama.  The final will take place on July 18.\nTo achieve this, Andonovski will rely on a mix of experience, talent and generations at his disposal: of the 23 players in the American squad, seven are in their thirties but eight are 25 or younger.  And so far, he hasn’t made any promises to anyone.\n“It doesn’t mean that all these players who have done well in the past are just going to come back here at the next camp because they did well a year or two years ago,” Andonovski said in February, when a the previous list also omitted several accomplished veterans.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "California, which once updated its cumulative case and death counts every weekday, now does so only twice a week.  In Florida, case and death data are released only once every two weeks.  As recently as last week, many other public testing sites shut down Alaska, Colorado and Rhode Island;  Iowa is closing many sites by the end of next week.\nRecent virus numbers have wobbled during holidays like Memorial Day and Juneteenth, during which many states often pause reporting and then restart tracking afterwards, a trend that is sure to continue this week. after the 4th of July holiday weekend.\n“Tracking the daily test tally is less informative than it used to be,” Dr Adalja said, citing the strong link between cases and hospitalizations in the past.  Today’s numbers shouldn’t be treated like checking a sports team’s daily standings or scores, he added.\n“I think testing plays a different role,” he said.  “Even when testing was at a different stage, it was always an underestimate.”\nTo get localized insight into the evolution of the virus, Dr Adjala said he had come to rely on hospitalizations as a percentage of his capacity.  It also checks the CDC community level monitoring, which includes new hospital admissions and the number of beds used.  He urges focusing on serious illnesses, rather than following “booms and busts of cases”.\nHospitalizations increased slightly throughout June, although they remain low.  Just over 33,000 people are in US hospitals with the coronavirus on average, and fewer than 4,000 are in intensive care.  Reports of new deaths remain below 400 a day, down from the country’s daily peak of more than 3,300 deaths in January 2021.\nLisa Waananen, Christine Chung and Alain Delaqueriere contributed report.\n\nSource Link",

But as the yen fell to the lowest in 20 years, Japan's bill became even bigger, with the price rise in crude oil, which has been some 40 percent in dollar terms since the start of 2022, reaching a whopping 70 percent in yen terms. \n\"A confluence of factors, including the higher fuel prices since the war and the tumbling currency, is putting a significant pressure on Japan's energy security, making this one of the most serious energy crises Japan has had,\" said Jane Nakano, a senior fellow at Washington-based think tank the Center for Strategic & International Studies.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Japan is trying to avoid power blackouts during a scorching heat wave by setting ACs to 82 degrees and turning off heated toilet seats (Fortune)  \nUpdate #2: Japan, South Korea buyers have not yet been asked to pay roubles for Russian LNG imports (Reuters)   \nWNU Editor: Because Japan imports 90% off its energy needs, it needs to continue to buy Russian oil and natural gas.
