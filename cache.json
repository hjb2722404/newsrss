It has the worst gender pay gap among OECD nations, while its traditional workplace culture results in many women giving up their careers after childbirth. Now the country has recorded the lowest fertility rate in the world, with women of reproductive age having fewer than one child on average. Sex crimes against women are frequent in a criminal justice system that often issues light sentences to perpetrators. We meet feminists who face online and physical threats including those who vow publicly not to marry or have children in protest of conservative societal attitudes. Meanwhile the country’s ultra-conservative government said it plans to abolish South Korea’s Gender Equality Ministry. We also talk to an advisor to the ruling political party who claims radical feminism has more in common with fascist parties in Europe and says anger over the issue has reached boiling point.",

Weiss, Wall Street Journal: It’s Time to End Magical Thinking About Russia’s Defeat \nPutin has withstood the West’s best efforts to reverse his invasion of Ukraine, and his hold on power is firm. The U.S. and its allies need a new strategy: containment. \nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress, not to mention the pro-Putin leanings of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\n Putin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: MSM Admits \"Magical Thinking\" Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine...

They agreed to resume military-to-military exchanges at both senior and operational levels. They also agreed to improve cooperation on counternarcotics, primarily aimed at ending the flow of Chinese-origin fentanyl into the United States. In addition, Washington and Beijing will expand dialogue on addressing the potential risks of artificial intelligence, continue to hold working-level consultations on a wider range of bilateral issues, and seek to increase educational and cultural exchanges between the two countries.
