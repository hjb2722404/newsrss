Some jumped from windows to save themselves, according to eyewitnesses, and firefighters broke the glass and rescued people with ropes.\nAuthorities said fire started in an office on the first floor and spread rapidly. Two owners of the company were arrested as part of probe to identify suspected safety violations.\nOffering condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised 200,000 rupees ($2,580) in compensation for the victims' next-of-kin.\n(Reporting by Anushree Fadnavis; Writing by Nupur Anand; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",

She noted that there could be sound reasons to attempt such an act, but noted that they had to be aligned with the law.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had again proposed the idea at the session held on the Baltic coast.\n\"We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in Europe,\" he said, arguing that Russia should be forced to pay for the war, not only in political or economic terms, but also financially.\nBeyond legal issues, many European leaders fear attempts to liquidate and transfer Russian funds will lead to countries like Russia and China seeking to set up an alternative international financial system, which would make sanctions a weaker tool in the future.\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaks at the closing press conference of the G7 Foreign Ministers summit.

Itâs my freedom.â\nThe book is a sharply focused portrait of a certain kind of privileged French family of its era, first revolutionary and then bourgeois: their sexual mores, their thirst for power and fame, the collateral damage to children.  The violation of her brother is explained, midbook, in one sentence: âHe started stroking me, and then, you know â¦â\nFrom this point, the narratorâs voice ages as she comes to understand what this means, and the book takes on aspects of a psychological thriller.  The twins keep the secret for years.  At last, fearful for the safety of their own children, strangled by a âhydraâ of guilt and shame, they confide in other members of their family, to decidedly mixed reaction.\nThe book finishes, effectively, in the most adult voice of all, that of the law.  Camille Kouchner addresses her stepfather directly, reciting the text of the French penal code on incest.  âLetâs be clear about this,â she writes:\n\nArticle 222â31â1 of the criminal code\nRape and sexual assaults are classified as incestuous when committed by:\n1) ascending year;\n2) a brother, a sister, an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, or a niece;\n3) or any other person, including a partner or family member, having legal or de facto control over the victim.\n\nClaire Berlinski is the editor in chief of The Cosmopolitan Globalist.

Since the start of the year, Bitcoinâs price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq, a benchmark heavily weighted towards tech stocks, suggesting that investors are treating it like any other risky asset.\nEtherâs price has also fallen, losing over 30% of its value over the past week.  Other cryptocurrencies, like Solana and Cardano, are also down.\nAny panic could be overdone, some analysts said.  A study by Mizuho showed that the average owner of Bitcoin on Coinbase would not lose money until the price of the digital currency fell below $21,000.  This, according to Mr. Dolev, is where a real death spiral could occur.\nâBitcoin worked as long as nobody lost money,â he said.  âOnce it gets back to those levels, itâs kind of an âOh, my Godâ moment.â\nProfessional investors who weathered the volatility in crypto also remained calm.  Hunter Horsley, managing director of Bitwise Asset Management, which provides crypto investment services to 1,000 financial advisers, met with more than 70 of them this week to discuss the market.  Many werenât selling, he said, because all other assets were down as well.  Some were even trying to capitalize on the decline.\nâTheir point of view is, âItâs not fun, but thereâs nowhere to hide,'â he said.\nStill, the price crash has rattled crypto traders.  Just a few months ago, blockchain proponents predicted that Bitcoinâs price could hit $100,000 this year.\n\nSource Link",

They were battling a series of injuries.  There were questions about whether Jayson Tatum could co-exist with Jaylen Brown â was it time for the team to consider trading Brown?  â as well as the inevitable criticisms of Ime Udoka in his first season as a coach.\nItâs a familiar story at this late stage of the season, but one worth repeating, especially now.  Why?  Because Friday night, following a late-game meltdown earlier in the week, the Celtics faced elimination in Milwaukee.  Outside their cocoon, as they prepared for Game 6, the questions swirled: Did they miss their chance?  Could they somehow find the resolve to extend their Easteâ¦",

He was an absolute horse.\nThe Rangers trailed 2-0 after one period and the Penguins, playing without Sidney Crosby, their star center and captain, were 40 minutes away from qualifying for the second round.  But Zibanejad scored two one-time slapshots in 76 seconds to tie the game.\nâThere is no giving up,â Zibanejad said of the comeback.  âThatâs what I love about this team.â\nA few minutes later, there was another crazy breakaway.  The game started when Rangers keeper Igor Shesterkin took advantage of a poor Penguins line change and delivered a perfect 100-foot pass on Zibanejadâs stick.  Zibanejad was alone again.\nâHis passing is better than all of us sometimes,â Zibanejad said of Shesterkinâs stickwork.\npenguin keeper Louis Domingue made the initial save on Zibanejad, but Kreider was there with his teammate, and he slammed the rebound to put Rangers ahead, 3-2.  If that sounds like the Game 5 scoring pattern at Madison Square Garden, it was, and would continue, until the last goal in an empty New York net at the end.\nEvgeni Malkin scored for the Penguins to even things up, 3-3, on a breakaway late in the second period.  The game remained tied until just 1:28 remained.  Kreider then fired a high slap shot which Domingue saved in front of his chest, but the puck spun over his head and landed behind him and into the net.\nâNobody said it was going to be easy,â Penguins defenseman Kris Letang said.  âThey are a very good team. They have a lot of talented players who can score goals.\n\nSource Link",

She added that the officer had an âaccusatory tone: he was not askingâ.\nWhen a student asked how the routine traffic stop turned into a drug search, she said, an officer replied that charter buses on this section of the highway were known to drug and human trafficking.  Although nervous and scared, Ms Jenkins said she tried to stay calm, as students gathered by the window to look outside and others sat in shock.  She said she feared a single bad word could inflame the situation.\nThe universityâs student newspaper, the hornet, published an article on traffic control by Sydney Anderson, a member of the team.

Thanks to a GM scholarship, she earned a masterâs degree in business administration at Stanford.  Since entering the executive ranks, she has held leadership positions in global manufacturing, human resources, product development and supply chain management.\nIn January 2014, she succeeded Daniel F. Akerson as CEO and became the first woman to lead a major automotive company.  Ms Barra guided GM through a scandal stemming from a faulty ignition switch linked to crashes that claimed more than 100 lives.  She then made a series of decisions that showed that the General Motors that had just come out of bankruptcy was not the conservative, weighty giant that consumers and investors had known for a century.\nIn a move that would once have been unthinkable, it decided to withdraw from the European market, a slow-growing, low-margin region where GM had been posting losses for two decades.  GM has sold its European operations to French Peugeot SA, which is now part of Stellantis.  The sale included the Opel division, which had been owned by GM since 1929.\nRemoving loss-making businesses that had been tolerated for years âhelped change the mindset,â she said.  âThe whole company kind of said, âWell, itâs a new day.  ââ\nGM, which had long prided itself on developing its own technology, also acquired an automated vehicle startup, Cruise Automation.  In another unprecedented move, GM brought in outside investors, including Honda and T. Rowe Price, to share the costs and risks of spending billions of dollars on self-driving vehicles.\nAlong the way, Ms Barra formed a close partnership with Mr Reuss, a contemporary who had been a candidate for the top job in 2014. He too spent his career at GM and had followed his own father, Lloyd Reuss, a former president of the company.\n\nSource Link",

One of the main reasons for this increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.\nThe study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in a given year, although not common, is not a rare event.  The researchers therefore looked at other factors that could have contributed to the high death toll and damage caused by the disaster.\nAmong these, they wrote, were the legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era.  In 1958, for example, Durban City Council passed a measure that forced non-whites to settle in areas that were less desirable and, in many cases, more prone to flooding.\nThe researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements due to rapid urban growth and lack of affordable housing.  Around 22% of Durbanâs population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which generally lack proper services and infrastructure.  During the April floods, the study noted that about 4,000 of the 13,500 homes that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most deaths also occurred in these areas.\nâOnce again we see how climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people,â said Friederike Otto, founder of World Weather Attribution and a climatologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "In another groundbreaking study published last year, Jaimie Henderson and several colleagues, including biomedical engineer Francis Willett and electrical engineer Krishna Shenoy, reported an equally impressive but entirely different approach to neural interface communication.  Scientists recorded neurons firing in Dennis DeGrayâs brain as he visualized himself writing words with a pen on a notepad, trying to recreate the distinct hand movements required for each letter .  He mentally wrote down thousands of words so that the system would reliably recognize the unique patterns of neural activity specific to each letter and produce words on a screen.  âYou really learn to hate Mâs after a while,â he told me with characteristic good humor.  In the end, the method was extremely effective.  Deâ¦",

          "description": "Dr Ãzel said the new imageâs similarity to that of 2019 demonstrated that the previous image was no coincidence.  In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the black hole M87 was 1,500 times more massive than that of the Milky Way;  typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.  âThe similarity on such a huge scale is amazing,â said Dr Galison.\nAt Thursdayâs press event, Michael Johnson, a member of the team and also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, said, âThis is an extraordinary verification of Einsteinâs theory of general relativity. â\nEinsteinâs Bad Dream\nBlack holes were an undesirable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which attributed gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, in the same way that a mattress sags under a sleeper.\nEinsteinâs insight led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which spacetime could quiver, bend, tear, expand, swirl, and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole, an entity with a gravity so strong that not even light could escape.  this.\nEinstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be dotted with black holes.  Many are the remnants of dead stars that have collapsed in on themselves and continued to advance.\nBut there seems to be a black hole at the center of almost every galaxy, including ours, which may be millions or billions of times more massive than our sun.  Astronomers still donât understand how these supermassive black holes got so big.\nParadoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.  Materials â gas, dust, jagged stars â falling into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.  Some of this material falls into the black hole, but some is thrown out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.\n\nSource Link",
