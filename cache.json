Castillo, a leftist elected in 2021, was arrested after illegally trying to dissolve the Andean nation's Congress, the latest in a series of political crises the world's second-largest copper producer has faced in recent years.\nProsecutors on Wednesday said they were seeking 18 months of pretrial detention for Castillo, who has been charged with rebellion and conspiracy.

In particular, this applies to international sports events.\"\nAt this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the country's Russian Olympic Committee flag due to previous doping violations.\nHowever many athletes from Russia competed in uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag.\n© 2022 AFP",

We are certainly already living in a time of “wars and rumors of wars”, and tensions are approaching the boiling point in a number of key global flashpoints right now.  If several more major conflicts were to suddenly begin next year, we could potentially witness an extended period of geopolitical instability that would be unlike anything that we have ever witnessed.  It is easy to start wars, but it is much harder to end them.  If you doubt this, just look at what is going on in Ukraine.  There is no end in sight for that conflict, and there are several other wars that could literally erupt at any time.  The following are 5 global flashpoints which could absolutely explode during the early stages of 2023… \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The five conflicts/flashpoints are Ukraine, Iran, Taiwan, Serbia, and the China - India border.

The last official deaths were reported on Dec. 3.

That’s 10 percentage points less than in 2020, but is still the second-highest reading in history. \nThe data show how many countries are still reeling from the consequences of the pandemic: debt shot up in 2020 because of the economic recession, and so did deficits as governments extended financial help to individuals and businesses. As economies opened up, inflation set in as supply couldn’t meet demand, while food and energy costs rose because of war and climate pressures.   \nRead more ..... \nWNU Editor: These numbers are already out of date.

Lee/Released   \nAntonio Graceffo, Modern Diplomacy: Analysis of U.S. Ability to Counter the Russian Threat in the Arctic \nFrom the end of World War II until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States and Russia stood on opposing sides of a potential conflict. Through the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war, mutual destruction was avoided, and the spread of communism was held back. Eventually, economic pressure, partially caused by the arms race and partially deriving from the fallacy of communist economics, destroyed the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, it was replaced with the new Russia, which has similar expansionist goals. \nIn Europe, the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war are once again being played out, in Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies, the EU and NATO, are supporting the defense of a sovereign nation which has been invaded by Russia. Meanwhile, Russia has other ambitions which could pose a threat to U.S. ambitions. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: According to the above analysis. Even though Russia borders much of the Arctic, and that they have put the time, resources,  and investment in developing their part of the Arctic for as long as anyone can remember, this should be considered by the US and its allies a threat. \nThe conclusions of the above analysis also do not make sense. Its prediction that the Russian economy will collapse if their banks are kicked out of SWIFT have not happened. In fact the opposite has happened, and the Russian ruble is now more stronger than it was before the war.",
