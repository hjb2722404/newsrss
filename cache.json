Only a fifth of women in the EU go to the police when an intimate partner assaults them. Meanwhile, EU member states have failed to agree on how to address the worst crimes against women. Several countries continue to resist calls by Brussels to define non-consensual sex as rape, punishable by a stiff jail sentence. Today, in 2023, there is no common set of rules in the EU to punish rape, to the growing dismay of many. As Europe prepares to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25, we discuss the issue with two MEPs.",

In October 2011, Franco-Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was freed by Hamas after being held in captivity for more than five years. He'd been captured during a cross-border raid. In Perspective, we spoke to the man who played a key role in negotiating his release. Veteran hostage negotiator Dr Gershon Baskin is now Middle East director at the advocacy group International Communities. He told us that, assuming the truce holds and that Israel frees Palestinian prisoners as planned, \"there is a chance\" that all civilian hostages being held by Hamas will be released.",

Photographs published by North Korean state media showed what appeared to be leader Kim Jong Un watching the fiery launch of a rocket from a base.

The anti-Islam populist has vowed to form a government. \nWith 98% of the votes counted on Thursday, Geert Wilders' far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) won 37 of the 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. \nThe populist party was well ahead of a joint Labor-Green bloc with 25 seats and the conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte with 24 seats.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The affordability crisis is what propelled Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) to their showing in these elections.

          "description": "U.S. military aid to Ukraine in October under the Presidential Drawdown Authority was the lowest in nearly a year and a half. November may be worse. \n PBS/AP: Almost half of Americans think U.S. spending too much on Ukraine aid, AP-NORC poll says \nAs lawmakers in Washington weigh sending billions more in federal support to Kyiv to help fight off Russian aggression, close to half of the U.S. public thinks the country is spending too much on aid to Ukraine, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. \nThose sentiments, driven primarily by Republicans, help explain the hardening opposition among conservative GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill who are rebuffing efforts from President Joe Biden to approve a new tranche of Ukraine aid, arguing that the money would be better spent for domestic priorities. \nYet opposition to aid is down slightly from where it was a month ago in another AP-NORC poll. Now, 45% say the U.S. government is spending too much on aid to Ukraine in the war against Russia, compared with 52% in October. That shift appears to come mostly from Republicans: 59% now say too much is spent on Ukraine aid, but that’s down from 69% in October. \nNonetheless, the Republican resistance to continued Ukraine aid remains strong.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Almost half in new poll say too much money is going to Ukraine (The Hill)\n \nUpdate #2: Americans tiring of Ukraine war spending – poll (RT)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Polls or not I am still predicting a major Ukraine aid package being passed by the U.S. Congress in the coming weeks/months.",

Only 12 Turkish vessels will join the flotilla, he told Haber7.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU editor: This looks like a repeat of 2010 ....
