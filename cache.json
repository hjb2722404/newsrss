Russia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom blamed a technical fault in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. But the high-level manoeuvres in energy politics underlined the pervasive impact of the conflict, far beyond Ukraine's borders. The announcements came as Moscow and Kyiv traded blame over their actions on...",

The lack of the country’s favorite condiment has sent many of the French into a state of almost wild panic, with some going as far as to hoard and to cheat to secure their stock of their beloved “moutarde”.\nAt the end of May, Pierre Grandgirard, the owner and head-chef of the La Régate restaurant in Brittany headed out on his regular morning supply run when he ran into an unusual problem: he couldn’t get his hands on mustard.\n“I went everywhere, but they were all out,” he explained. To make matters worse, some shopkeepers told him astonishing tales of hoarding. “That a papy [French slang for granddad, eds. note] had come in and filled his shopping carrier with 10 or more pots in one go.”\nFo…",

She died aged 36 in a high-speed car crash while being chased by paparazzi photographers in Paris the following year. Charles married Camilla in 2005.\n© 2022 AFP",

          "description": "A 2-year-old girl has been killed by a large hailstone in north-eastern Spain, according to local media reports.\nThe ice lumps, which had a diameter of 10 centimetres and a weighted about half a kilogram, hit the ground at a speed of more than 100 kilometres per hour.\nOne of these projectiles hit the little girl on the head in the town of Bisbal d'Empordà in Catalonia. After spending the night in hospital in Girona, she succumbed to the severe injury on Wednesday.\n\"This is the first case I am aware of in which a human being has been killed by hail in Spain,\" La Vanguardia newspaper cited weather expert José Luis Sánchez as saying.\nTelevision footage showed rows of cars with smashed front and rear windows and dented sheet metal. Some people crawled under their cars in an attempt to find shelter.\nIt remained unclear at first whether such extreme hailstorms are a consequence of climate change.\nThe head of weather forecasting at Catalonia's meteorological service, Santi Segalà, pointed to the extreme temperatures.\n\"After a summer of prolonged heat and very high sea temperatures, the atmosphere is so charged that any small disturbance can trigger such a storm,\" La Vanguardia quoted him as saying.\nThe roof of a car dealership in La Bisbal D'empordà is seen damaged after a severe hailstorm. A 2-year-old girl has been killed by a large hailstone in north-eastern Spain, according to local media reports. Glòria Sánchez/EUROPA PRESS/dpa",
