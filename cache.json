          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r When it comes to shaping behaviors and fostering positive learning, the space in which students do their learning can have a profound impact on their learning outcomes. This philosophy was brought to life at a recent “Girls Go Tech” workshop co-hosted by The Women’s Foundation, an NGO dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls in Hong Kong, and Steelcase; an industry leader in creating great experiences in the Learning and Work Spaces through architecture, technology, furniture and design services.\r \r Launched in 2015, the “Girls Go Tech” (GGT) programme was put together by The Women’s Foundation to encourage female secondary school students from underprivileged backgrounds to pursue traditionally male-dominated STEM-related subjects. By connecting the students to various opportunities and stakeholders in the community, students are exposed to STEM subject matters and are given a hands-on opportunity to develop their self-confidence, problem solving skills, creativity and collaboration in order to help maximise their career options while achieving their academic and career goals. \r \r The most recent of these events was a visit hosted by Steelcase at their WorkLife space in Central, where students were invited to put their thinking caps on to conceptualize how to use technology and space to create a design learning space that offered better learning experiences. \r \r \r \r “Many of these girls lack confidence because they don’t have a chance at these experiences, so for some of our participants, this could be the first time they have even been to Central to go to a corporate partner’s office,” explained Connie Cheung, Programme Director for The Women’s Foundation. “This is a real eye-opening opportunity for them to visualize how technology is used in different industries.” \r \r Of course, when it comes to nurturing a design thinking approach amongst students, there is no better place to experience this than at Steelcase’s very own…",

Kwok Cheuk-kin, a well-known serial litigant, successfully applied for a temporary court order stopping authorities from putting their decision into effect, before securing legal aid to continue his cause.  Hectar Pun Hei, a senior counsel representing Kwok, submitted on Thursday that the health secretary had no power to overturn the opinion of a registered medical practitioner in relation to a person’s suitability for receiving Covid-19 shots, even if it turned out to be unreliable.

If re-elected, however, the far-right president could well find the numbers to make changes to the court.\nThe outcome of the bitter contest between Bolsonaro and social democratic ex-president Lula Inacio de Silva is hard to predict, ahead of the second round of Brazil’s presidential election on October 30.\nAfter getting 48 percent of the vote in the first round on October 2, Lula started trying to reach out to evangelical Christian…",

Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.\nThe move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday's session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.\nThey were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.\nAnother deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the \"special military operation\". He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.\n\"Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies,\" Svintsov said.\n(Reported by Filipp Lebedev; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)",

Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. \n“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”\nThe official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”\nThe FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. \n\"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”\n“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.” \nALSO IN THE NEWS: Marjorie Taylor Greene serves notice to Kevin McCarthy that he needs to hand her 'a lot of power' \nSee the full report at the Washington Post.",

Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role.

In several of Trump’s other investigations into potential crimes, officials are also unlikely to bring only obstruction charges, the people said.\nSome FBI agents opposed accusing Trump because the case would be “political.” Other FBI agents supported the charges against Trump, but as Bloomberg noted, the FBI deemed it irrelevant because they didn’t make a decision on the charges.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland and his team will ultimately decide whether Donald Trump is charged.

I am writing to recommend that you vote yes to question 2, which requires insurance companies to spend our dollars on actual dental care, instead of executive salaries, corporate profits, and administration.  I think patient money should be spent on patient care.  A yes vote to question 2 would require dental insurance companies to spend at least 83% of our premiums on members’ dental expenses.  And it would protect against increases in dental premiums above the CPI, unless approved by the state.\nMy own dental plan has high premiums and many deductibles.

Democrats here had hoped to tilt the playing field in their favor, but after a Republican lawsuit and a court ruling, the state ended up with a more neutral map for the next decade.  The new lines have already caused heartburn-inducing primaries for Democrats this summer, and could bring more twists in the critical midterm elections in November. \n\n\tSee how the boroughs of these NYC boroughs have changed or search for your neighborhood below: \n\n\n\n\n\nold Astoria \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMorning Heights \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBensonhurst \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCooperative City \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBedford-Stuyvesant \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsunset park \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOld Astoria-Hallets Point, Queens\n\t\tThis is a ne…",

          "description": "President Biden says the conservative Supreme Court majority and extremist Republicans are about to discover women’s political power.\nVideo of President Biden:\n\nThe president said: “With Dobbs’ decision, the court actually dared women to move on, lead, be heard. In my opinion, one of the most unusual parts of the decision was when most wrote, “Women are not without Suffrage or political rights”. Let me tell you one thing. The courts and extreme Republicans have spent decades trying to overthrow Luo. They’ll know in a minute.”\nBiden later added: “The only way to stop these extremist laws that endanger women’s health and rights is for Congress to pass a law, I said in court nearly 50 years ago that Roy was right and I believe Congress should codify Roy once and for all.”\nBiden said that if more Democrats are elected to the House and Senate, “If we do that, here’s the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. When Congress passes it, and I will sign it in January, 50 years after Roy first decided the land law, “Together we will restore the right of choice for every woman on this land.  “\nSpeaker Pelosi dismisses Andre Mitchell’s GOP talking points on midterms When Mitchell tried to claim that voters were more interested in the economy and crime than choice.\nBiden is right. Republicans are about to discover the political power of women who make up the majority of the country, and when they flex their political muscle, the repercussions will be felt across the country.\nPolls have consistently underestimated women’s turnout in special elections. If the trend continues on Election Day, the president will be vindicated and Democrats can retain their one or two majorities in Congress.\n\nSource: Politicususa.com",

Its attack drones can swarm to paralyze communications networks. China’s naval ships outnumber America’s, and it launched its third aircraft carrier this summer, the first to be designed and built in the country. Its defense budget is second only to the U.S.’s. China’s military has more serving members, at around 2 million, compared with just under 1.4 million in the U.S. \nThe question for Mr. Xi, which he has raised in public, is whether those forces are ready for battle. \nChina hasn’t fought a war since a brief border clash with Vietnam in 1979. Unlike American forces, who have fought for most of the past two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan, China’s service members have virtually no combat experience—which some Chinese leaders have referred to as a “peace disease.” Finding a solution short of actual war has been a priority for Mr. Xi, especially as he seeks to prepare the country for a potential showdown with the U.S.   \nRead more .... \n WNU Editor: I know my Chinese friends firmly believe that China's military capabilities now far exceed what the U.S. has in Asia. As to becoming a global military power equal to the U.S.. Quoting the above article .... \n.... Mr. Xi’s ambition, according to China’s most recent defense white paper, is to complete a modernization of the military by 2035 and turn it into a “world-class force” by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party’s founding.",
