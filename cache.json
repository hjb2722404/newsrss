A lasting drought and high winds meant the fire spread quickly, according to the mayor of the village, Vicente Rodríguez, who spoke to state television broadcaster RTVE. \nFirefighters were unable to extinguish the flames as the wind kept changing direction. At least 11 houses burned down and an area of about 140 hectares was destroyed.",

Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.\n\"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy,\" said Austin. \"I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.\"\n\"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"That's our policy,\" said Austin.\nWatch below or click here.\n\n\nLloyd Austin calls on Tommy Tuberville to drop military block\n\nwww.youtube.com",

An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.\nHis attorney said that he had been \"eaten alive.\"\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates \"do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.\" \n“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,\" she said. \nClarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a \"racial justice issue,\" citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail. \nRead the full report at The Washington Post.",

          "description": "New York Times: After Suffering Heavy Losses, Ukrainians Paused to Rethink Strategy \nIn the first two weeks of Ukraine’s grueling counteroffensive, as much as 20 percent of the weaponry it sent to the battlefield was damaged or destroyed, according to American and European officials. The toll includes some of the formidable Western fighting machines — tanks and armored personnel carriers — the Ukrainians were counting on to beat back the Russians. \nThe startling rate of losses dropped to about 10 percent in the ensuing weeks, the officials said, preserving more of the troops and machines needed for the major offensive push that the Ukrainians say is still to come.            \n  \nSome of the improvement came because Ukraine changed tactics, focusing more on wearing down the Russian forces w…",

          "description": "Today is the last day for Ukrainians to be able to apply for a special visa to immigrate to Canada. \nIt has been a very hectic few weeks .... correction .... it has been hectic since the start of the war, and in a certain way it comes to an end for me in a few hours.\n\nNeedless to say. Today is a very busy day for me.\nBlogging will return this evening. Or I will just go to Old Montreal and enjoy a good meal reflecting on the past 18 months.\nOne more note, A heads up on where the Ukraine war is going. I have been told by a few sources that I trust in Ukraine that President Zelensky was told by NATO leaders in Vilnius this past week that he has until November to show major results on the battle field. If not, Western support will decease and pressure will be put on him to make a deal with Putin. Some Russian bloggers that I follow have also been reporting the same thing. If true, I expect a major escalation in the conflict in the coming weeks and months. I hate to say this. But we are probably entering a stage where we are going to be witness to the most bloodiest fighting since the start of the war.",
