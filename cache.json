It may be a nod to far-right conspiracy theorists trying to interpret current events through end-times prophecy.\n\"QAnon & many fundamentalists will read this — & I don’t think it’s a stretch to imagine Trump’s people are aware of that — as both the indictment & 7th seal of Revelation, the opening of which heralds the second coming of Christ,\" wrote Sharlet.\nThe Seven Seals, described in the Book of Revelation, secure a book that appeared to John of Patmos in an apocalyptic vision. In the story, each seal breaking progressively takes the world closer to apocalypse, with the final seal portending the second coming and the final judgment against the world. \nThis could also bolster beliefs among some of the religious far right that Biden is the Antichrist — as some also believed of former President Barack Obama, Sharlet said.\nAll of this comes as Trump prepares to face arraignment in Miami on Tuesday, and as authorities brace for the possibility of violence from Trump supporters in the vicinity, supported by escalating violent rhetoric on pro-Trump corners of the internet.",

          "description": "-Lawyers for Ukraine at the top U.N. court on Monday rejected Russia's account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a \"rambling conspiracy theory\", in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.\nKyiv says that Moscow violated a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in July 2014.\nLast November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had \"overall control\" over the separatist forces.\nRussia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, Russia said Ukraine's MH17 case was based on \"nonsense\" and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened.\nOn Monday, Ukraine's lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been \"subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory\" about the shooting down of MH17 which would be \"better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet\".\nKyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and order it to pay reparations.\nRussia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. It also says it has met its obligations under the U.N. treaty against financing terrorism. Russia will get a last chance to reply to Ukraine's allegations on Thursday.\nThe World Court case stems from 2017 and was filed well before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year.\n(Editing by William Maclean and Mark Heinrich)",

          "description": "The Hill: Nearly half in new poll say Trump indictment is politically motivated  \nAlmost half of Americans in a new poll said that they believe the federal indictment of former President Trump is politically motivated after he was charged with 37 counts in relation to the alleged mishandling of records at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \nForty-seven percent of respondents in the ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday say the charges against Trump are politically motivated, while 37 percent say they are not. Sixteen percent say they are not sure. \nMost Republicans — 80 percent — say the charges announced last week are politically motivated, with only 16 percent of Democrats aligning with that view. \nBy comparison, 71 percent of Democrats say the charges are not rooted in politics. Only nine percent of Republicans say the same. \n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: Only half?!?!?!? \nThe details of the ABC/IPSOS poll are here .... Most Americans view latest Trump charges as serious (IPSOS). \nUpdate: Lawyer Robert Barnes is right (see tweet below). But that is not the media or political narrative right now.\n\nAny executive branch document created before or during a Presidency is the President's to do with as he pleases. That's the point of The Presidential Records Act. It has to be that way to keep Constitutional power in the hands of the only elected official of the executive branch.…\n— Robert Barnes (@barnes_law) June 9, 2023",

With the other main opposition party, the Social Democrats, plagued by infighting, Kickl’s party has the best chance in years to seize power.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Its not only Austria and Slovakia that the political winds are changing.

          "description": "Politico: The Pentagon Is Freaking Out About a Potential War With China  \nThe war began in the early morning hours with a massive bombardment — China’s version of “shock and awe.” Chinese planes and rockets swiftly destroyed most of Taiwan’s navy and air force as the People’s Liberation army and navy mounted a massive amphibious assault across the 100-mile Taiwan Strait. Having taken seriously President Joe Biden’s pledge to defend the island, Beijing also struck pre-emptively at U.S. and allied air bases and ships in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. managed to even the odds for a time by deploying more sophisticated submarines as well as B-21 and B-2 stealth bombers to get inside China’s air defense zones, but Washington ran out of key munitions in a matter of days and saw its network access severed. The United States and its main ally, Japan, lost thousands of servicemembers, dozens of ships, and hundreds of aircraft. Taiwan’s economy was devastated. And as a protracted siege ensued, the U.S. was much slower to rebuild, taking years to replace ships as it reckoned with how shriveled its industrial base had become compared to China’s.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Taking a quote from the above Politico article, it is always about the money .... “We could throw a trillion dollars a year at the defense budget now, and we’re not going to get a meaningful increase in traditional military capabilities in the next five years.” (Christian Brose, chief strategy officer, Anduril Industries).",
