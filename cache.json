The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "In Iran, the death of 22-year-old student Mahsa Amini triggered an unprecedented uprising that is still having repercussions. Arrested on September 13, 2022 by Iran's morality police for wearing an \"ill-fitting\" headscarf that did not fully cover her hair, Amini died three days later in hospital, provoking a wave of anger and protests across the country. A new generation of women is now daring to defy the mandatory Islamic veil law imposed by the mullahs. Who are these young women ready to break the law, and how do they differ from their elders? Our reporters Catalina Gomez Angel and Pouya Parsa Magham went to meet the Iranian women determined to fight for their freedom despite threats and intimidation.",

Jerry Nadler (D-NY) last month also called for the DOJ to review its history of working with Smirnov, and he suggested that investigators had left themselves vulnerable for falling for foreign intelligence operations as \"part of a deliberate attempt to launder foreign disinformation through the Department of Justice.\"",

          "description": "The U.S. ambassador to China said Friday that Beijing's position on a potential TikTok ban in the United States was \"supremely ironic\" given the ruling Communist Party's censorship of online platforms within its borders.\nThe US House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill on Wednesday that would force the wildly popular short-video app to break with its Chinese parent company or face a nationwide ban.\nChina has sharply criticized the approval, slamming what it called Washington's \"bandit\" mentality and accusing lawmakers of \"unjustly suppressing foreign companies\".\nUS ambassador Nicholas Burns offered a rebuke on Friday, saying Beijing's stance was unjustified given it blocks many Western web platforms from operating in the country.\n\"I find it supremely ironic that government officials here in China... have been criticizing the United States for the debate we're currently having on TikTok,\" Burns said during an online seminar held by the East-West Center, a US-based research organisation.\n\"They won't even let TikTok be available to 1.4 billion Chinese,\" he said in response to a question about the avenues for American public diplomacy in China.\nChina's government tightly controls the spread of information online and scrubs out social media content it deems politically sensitive.\nMany Western platforms, including Google, Facebook and Instagram, are blocked from operating in the country.\nTikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance also runs a separate version of the app inside China called Douyin.\nSome Western governments have voiced concern about TikTok's soaring popularity, alleging that the app's ownership makes it subservient to Beijing -- a claim TikTok denies.\nThe bill, which has also been criticized by TikTok creators and users, is expected to face a tougher challenge in the US Senate.\nThe White House has indicated that President Joe Biden would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.",

Rand Paul (R-KY) during a segment on Fox & Friends this Thursday as the two discussed the potential ban of the social media platform TikTok in the United States and whether or not the app is controlled by the Chinese government. \nAccording to Kilmeade, the app's alleged link to China is “national security issue\" since its algorithm is controlled by the Chinese. But Paul countered that the app's alleged ties to China are not as straightforward as lawmakers and some in the media are suggesting. The conversation then turned tense as the two argued who the actual owners of TikTok are. \n“Who owns that company? ByteDance. ByteDance is owned by China,” Kilmeade said.\n“No. It’s not. See, that’s a lie,” Paul replied, accusing Kilmeade of defaming the company and its owners. \nAlso read: 'This is insane': Legal experts take wrecking ball to latest Trump classified docs defense\n“Who controls the algorithm? It’s not nonprofits. Who owns the algorithm!?” Kilmeade asked.\n“TikTok owns the own algorithm and it’s not in China,” Paul replied, adding, “You just told a lie. You can’t say something on TV something that’s a lie by a company. That is an out and out lie and it is provably false.\" \n“What is a lie?” Kilmeade responded.\n“They are not owned by the Chinese government! TikTok is owned privately,” Paul countered.\n“ByteDance controls the algorithm. That’s all that matters!” Kilmeade said.\nKilmeade went on to accuse Paul of being “comfortable with TikTok influencing America.\" \n“I’m comfortable with the Constitution. You cannot take people’s property without due process,” Paul said. “If you believe there’s a national exemption to the Constitution then you believe that Fox News could be shut down, that Twitter could be shut down. That’s a terrible thing to believe.”\nWatch the video below or at this link. \n\n\n —  (@)",
