The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Having taken seriously President Joe Biden’s pledge to defend the island, Beijing also struck pre-emptively at U.S. and allied air bases and ships in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. managed to even the odds for a time by deploying more sophisticated submarines as well as B-21 and B-2 stealth bombers to get inside China’s air defense zones, but Washington ran out of key munitions in a matter of days and saw its network access severed. The United States and its main ally, Japan, lost thousands of servicemembers, dozens of ships, and hundreds of aircraft. Taiwan’s economy was devastated. And as a protracted siege ensued, the U.S. was much slower to rebuild, taking years to replace ships as it reckoned with how shriveled its industrial base had become compared to China’s.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Taking a quote from the above Politico article, it is always about the money .... “We could throw a trillion dollars a year at the defense budget now, and we’re not going to get a meaningful increase in traditional military capabilities in the next five years.” (Christian Brose, chief strategy officer, Anduril Industries).",

A timeline graphic compiled by GAO now states the missile’s initial operational capability (IOC) date is estimated for between April and June 2030, a delay of approximately one year.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: US Air Force's $96 Billion Northrop ICBM Faces 1+ Year Delay (NOC) (Bloomberg)\n \nUpdate #2: New ICBM Delayed at Least a Year, GAO Says (Defense One)\n\n \nWNU Editor: A year delay will also mean cost over-runs.",

          "description": "Millions of Ethiopians are dependent on food aid (Reuters)\nWashington Post: USAID cuts food aid supporting millions of Ethiopians amid charges of massive government theft \nThe U.S. government is suspending food aid to Ethiopia after an investigation uncovered a widespread scheme to steal donated food, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said Thursday, a move that will affect millions of the world’s poorest people. Leaked documents given to donors and shared with The Washington Post indicate that the scheme was coordinated by elements within both the country’s federal and regional governments. \nOfficials have been diverting aid from those who need it to feed the military and ex-combatants, and selling it on the open market to millers who re-exported the flour, according to an investigation by USAID that was summarized to The Post by officials familiar with the investigation. \n\n \nRead more .... \nUS Suspends Food Aid To Ethiopia Amid Charges Of Massive Government Theft\n\n \nEthiopia: US agency suspends food as drought grips country -- BBC\n \nReport: US Suspends Food Aid to Ethiopia Amid Theft Accusations -- VOA\n \nUS halts food aid to Ethiopia over diverted supplies -- AFP\n \nUSAID suspends all food assistance to Ethiopia after uncovering scheme diverting aid -- CNN\n \nUSAID says it is halting all food aid to Ethiopia amid diversions -- Al Jazeera",
