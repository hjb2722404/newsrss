Their exclusion from public life is having dire consequences for the entire country. We discuss the situation with Melissa Cornet, a human rights researcher who works with the NGO CARE. She notes that the lack of new female graduates means that there will soon be no more women teachers, doctors or nurses in Afghanistan. She also points out that while bans on female aid workers are having a devastating effect, many NGOs are closing not because of the bans, but due to lack of funding – with only 5 percent of Afghanistan's humanitarian needs currently being met.",

He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.\nAuthorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.\nInitial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.\nBy Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.\n\"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening,\" one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.\n\"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification.\"\nEarly on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.\n(Reporting by Liz Lee, Bernard Orr and Ethan Wang; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Clarence Fernandez)",

But as Republicans hotly debate ongoing military aid to Kiev, neither party has questioned the far more costly submarine program—allowing the Navy to conceal a startling fact about America's submarine fleet. The Navy calls its submarines \"the most lethal and capable force.\" It is also the \"silent service,\" shrouded in secrecy, the nature of its operations closely guarded. \nThe American attack submarine force—the \"fighting\" submarines—exists in order to pursue enemy submarines and ships, eavesdrop on adversaries and support operations by special forces. Hollywood productions like The Hunt for Red October have created the impression of submarines tracking the enemy while moving noiselessly under the sea, operating stealthily for months on end. The reality is markedly different. The U.S. Navy can deploy barely a quarter of its attack submarine force at any one time, and last year, despite a war raging in Ukraine and China's rise as a global superpower, only 10 percent of its submarines operated stealthily by spending more than 30 days fully submerged. \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: I am surprised to learn that only a fraction of the US submarine fleet is deployed at any one time.",

The reactor, known as a fast breeder, excels at making plutonium, a top fuel of atom bombs. \nThe nuclear material for the reactor is being supplied by Russia, whose Rosatom nuclear giant has in the past few months completed the delivery of 25 tons of highly enriched uranium to get production started. That deal means that Russia and China are now cooperating on a project that will aid their own nuclear modernizations and, by the Pentagon’s estimates, produce arsenals whose combined size could dwarf that of the United States.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: China's nuclear weapons growth is having an impact on U.S. policy.
