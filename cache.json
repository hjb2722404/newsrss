But other of the significant names on the CIA's list were ignored.  \nTrump \"was more interested in a young and less influential figure much farther down the list, according to two people familiar with the briefings, because he recognized the name,\" the report said at the time. \n\n\"He would say, 'I've never heard of any of these people. What about Hamza bin Laden?'\" the former official told NBC.\nA Pentagon official agreed, noting, \"That was the only name he knew.\" \nBy contrast, Biden explained that after \"relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year. He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family.\"\n\"This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians, and one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success,\" Biden also said.",

Mark Hertling broke down the significance of the successful U.S. strike that took out Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda who took over from Osama bin Laden.\nZawahiri, noted Hertling, has been sought by the U.S. for decades — and was a critical piece of the terrorist operation.\n\"How significant is this strike killing the al-Qaeda leader?\" asked anchor Wolf Blitzer.\n\"This is a target the U.S. has been going after for three decades, even before the 9/11 strike,\" said Hertling. \"He leads al-Qaeda with various networks around the globe. Central places in control. These areas, we're talking about an individual who is the CEO of this organization. You can debate how powerful he is, compared to bin Laden, but it's a big deal.\"\nAnother important aspect, said Hertling, is how the U.S. was able to take him out despite no longer having on-the-ground intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan, having withdrawn U.S. forces last year.\n\"This is more than likely a drone strike. I would give that a 70 percent possibility,\" said Hertling. \"I would not rule out a hand strike on this individual, either. What you are talking about, the kinds of things we were talking about when we withdrew from Afghanistan, this will be an over-the-horizon strike with very little capability for collecting intelligence within Afghanistan.

          "description": "UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced \"a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War\" and was just \"one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\"\n\"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,\" Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" he said, calling on nations to \"put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.\"\nGuterres's comments came at the opening 10th review conference of the NPT, an international treaty that came into force in 1970 to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\nThe meeting, held at the UN's headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will run until August 26.\nGuterres said the conference was \"a chance to strengthen\" the treaty and \"make it fit for the worrying world around us,\" citing Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East.\n\"Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used,\" the secretary-general implored, adding that he would visit Hiroshima for the anniversary of the August 6, 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city by the United States.\n\"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,\" Guterres added.\nIn January, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- had pledged to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons.\nAt the last review conference in 2015, the parties were unable to reach agreement on substantive issues.\n© 2022 AFP",

What they find instead is a Falstaff who might have come out of a formal painted portrait: a balding, elderly knight with tufts of silver hair and mustaches. sparse, a huge belly, rosy cheeks and squinting frog eyes peering through boozy mists.The sight is so eerie that you cling to your seat.\n“You realize,” Mr. Rich continued, “that it is the character of Shakespeare, and not a parody of camp, that is being served.”\nPatricia Ann Carroll was born May 5, 1927 in Shreveport, Louisiana and grew up in Los Angeles.  Her father, Maurice, worked for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Electricity;  his mother, Kathryn (Meagher) Carroll, worked in real estate and office management.\nMs Carroll attended the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles on an English scholarship, but left before she graduated.  “I realized what I was learning wasn’t going to advance what I wanted to do,” she said in 2011. “I always thought experience was the best preparation.”\nIn 1947, Ms. Carroll left Los Angeles for Plymouth, Mass., where she worked at the Priscilla Beach Theater and, she said, ate, drank and breathed the theater.  She made her professional stage debut there that year in “A Goose for the Gander”, with Gloria Swanson.  Soon after, she traveled to New York, where, among other odd jobs, she shined shoes.\n\nSource Link",
