          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r  \r \r Thanks to the rise of smartphones and mobile technology, consumers are increasing their use of digital payment acceptance methods such as credit cards, mobile payment apps, and other forms of contactless payment methods to pay for everything, from big-ticket items to groceries and bus fares. It is more important than ever for small businesses to ensure they are not falling behind on the cashless trend.\r \r Over the past two years, the pandemic has accelerated this transformation, with Hong Kong seeing its largest drop in cash usage.

Many of these SMBs are eager to adopt digital payment methods, and many now understand the benefits to their business when providing this option for customers. \r \r \"Setting up a point-of-sale terminal seemed daunting at first when we considered accepting digital payments,\" says Koyi Chan, owner of flower shop Botanic Union. \"But it turned out to be less of a hassle than expected.\" \r \r \"Allowing our customers to pay digitally has had a huge impact on our business, especially during the Christmas season when people shop for Christmas trees and flowers at our shop and on our website.

          "description": "During the 2016 election season, Russian hackers went after the national Republican and Democratic Party servers. Now according to the FBI, China is setting its sights on state parties, which likely have lower resources available for tech security. \nThe Washington Post revealed that government hackers are scanning domains looking for possible vulnerabilities. Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. \n“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”\nThe official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”\nThe FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. \n\"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”\n“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.” \nALSO IN THE NEWS: Marjorie Taylor Greene serves notice to Kevin McCarthy that he needs to hand her 'a lot of power' \nSee the full report at the Washington Post.",

          "description": "In a bold restaurant move to the Upper East Side, Campagnola – an “Italian country restaurant” at 1382 First Ave.  for nearly 40 years – has moved from its apartment building to the modern Impala condo tower two blocks north at 1456 First Ave., where its new owner will be Aby Rosen’s RFR Realty.\nIt’s a great change of venue for Campagnola, which has long attracted celebrities, politicians and senior law enforcement officials entering through a rustic front room with a vaulted ceiling.  The menu’s hearty southern and northern Italian dishes are suited to the “country” theme and “meant to be shared,” its website says.  \nBut the president of Meridian Retail Leasing, James Famularo, who negotiated the lease for Campagnola owner Curt Huegel said Huegel “relyed on a talented designer, Delphine Mauroit, owner of DMDesign & Architecture, to capture the soul and vibe of the original” – possibly including the original bar, furniture and artwork.\nThe new space in a former yoga studio at the base of the tower will have 3,400 “perfect L-shaped” square feet on the ground, Famularo said, plus 2,000 square feet in the basement.  The configuration allows the dining room to occupy the entire ground floor.\nHe couldn’t discuss the terms due to a nondisclosure agreement.  The move is expected to take place in about nine months.\nThe owner was replaced by Brandon Singer of MONA leasing, a brokerage firm backed by RFR.\nHuegel’s company, Host Restaurants, owns several major locations in and out of town.  Among them is the Sefton Bar/Lounge opposite the original Campagnola – a lease which Famularo also managed.\nHuegel was always known for restaurantsnot for the bars – but Famularo said he got the idea from Sefton when he noticed many Campagnola customers were looking for drinks nearby while waiting for their tables.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "For high school teacher and mother Jennifer Shaffer, time and sleep are two precious assets.  So with the end of DST    approaching, the busy mother says she fears changing the clock. \n“It’s definitely going to mess us up and mess us up over the next few days, even a week,” Shaffer told CBS News. \nShe is not alone.  according to one vote conducted by Monmouth University, six out of 10 Americans said they would rather make daylight saving time permanent — abandoning the practice of changing the clock twice a year created during World War I to save energy.\n\nTurning our clocks back and forth may soon be a thing of the past – if a few lawmakers get their way.\nThis year, Congress brought the issue into the spotlight when the House energy committee heard testimony at a formal hearing about how changing the clock is linked to increased risk of depression, stroke and sleep disorders.  According to National Children’s Hospital sleep specialist Dr.  Tyish Hall Brown, changing watches can have an impact on the body.\n“We have a kind of internal rhythm to our bodies and our health,” Brown said.  “And every time we move forward or backward, that too has to adjust.”\nIn March, the US Senate unanimously legislation passed    without warning to make DST permanent starting in 2023, if the US House and President agree.\nMichigan Congressman Fred Upton said the effort will likely fall short in the House, in part because some people in the western section of the time zones say they are concerned that permanent daylight saving time could make mornings too dark and late. \n“Not only would [school buses] running in the dark, the kids would probably be in the second or third hour while it was still dark,” he said. \nNearly 15 years ago, Upton championed an energy-saving law that extended DST    even later in November. \n“Particularly with global warming, climate change is real,” he said.  “Why not take advantage of this extra hour of sunlight?”\n    \n      \nSource Link",

My father was the first thing he said to our family, you know? I love fighting for this country. We use a surprising number of arrows, but we love red, white and blue. Well, I sure hope my dad does it again. \nI think he is the best president this country has ever had. He is willing to fight. No other Republican is willing to fight and I think he fundamentally changed the party. Republicans are no longer Republicans. This is the Trump Party.\nRepublicans are in a tight House race across the country. Swing district candidates are trying to pretend Donald Trump doesn’t exist, and here’s Eric Trump reminding America that voting for any Republican on the 2022 ballot is as good as voting for Donald Trump.\nRepublicans likely won’t win control of the Senate, as Trump’s Senate roster is a massive failure.\nThe GOP needs Donald Trump to leave on Election Day. His presence in the midterms hurt Republican voters. Instead, Eric Trump is touching his father’s ego and reminding every voter in America that the Republican Party that was once the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan now belongs to Donald Trump.\n\n\nSource: Politicususa.com",
