In particular, this applies to international sports events.\"\nAt this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes were only allowed to compete under the country's Russian Olympic Committee flag due to previous doping violations.\nHowever many athletes from Russia competed in uniforms in the colors of the Russian flag.\n© 2022 AFP",

Specifically, the Special Operations Research Office (SORO) at American University established in 1957 should be considered. This may be an appropriate model because SORO was focused on gaining a deep understanding of revolutions, resistance, and insurgency, phenomena which persist around the world today that we describe as irregular warfare. SORO provided direct intellectual support to strategy development and campaign execution.  The U.S. Army Special Operations Command has protected the previous work of SORO and in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory National Security Analysis Department has updated this work for the 21st Century in the Assessing Revolutionary and Insurgent Strategies (ARIS) Studies.  The newly established IWC could follow in the footsteps of SORO and partner with a premier academic institution.\n Developing a mastery of irregular warfare\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3774711-developing-a-mastery-of-irregular-warfare/\nBY CHARLES T.

          "description": "U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication 2nd Class Micheal H. Lee/Released   \nAntonio Graceffo, Modern Diplomacy: Analysis of U.S. Ability to Counter the Russian Threat in the Arctic \nFrom the end of World War II until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States and Russia stood on opposing sides of a potential conflict. Through the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war, mutual destruction was avoided, and the spread of communism was held back. Eventually, economic pressure, partially caused by the arms race and partially deriving from the fallacy of communist economics, destroyed the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, it was replaced with the new Russia, which has similar expansionist goals. \nIn Europe, the U.S. strategies of containment and limited war are once again being played out, in Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies, the EU and NATO, are supporting the defense of a sovereign nation which has been invaded by Russia. Meanwhile, Russia has other ambitions which could pose a threat to U.S. ambitions. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: According to the above analysis. Even though Russia borders much of the Arctic, and that they have put the time, resources,  and investment in developing their part of the Arctic for as long as anyone can remember, this should be considered by the US and its allies a threat. \nThe conclusions of the above analysis also do not make sense. Its prediction that the Russian economy will collapse if their banks are kicked out of SWIFT have not happened. In fact the opposite has happened, and the Russian ruble is now more stronger than it was before the war.",

(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Joshua Magbanua)   \nDefense News: Congress supersizes munitions production with emergency authorities \nWASHINGTON — Congress is set to allocate more than $8 billion to bolster high-priority munitions production while granting the Pentagon wartime procurement powers to help Ukraine fight Russia and refill U.S. stockpiles. \nThe $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2023, which the House passed 350-80 on Thursday and is expected to face a Senate vote this week, authorizes more than $2.7 billion in across-the-board munitions funding. That’s on top of $5.9 billion for the Navy to procure additional munitions and expand U.S. industrial base production capacity. Congress is still negotiating a final appropriations package to fund the munitions authorizations alongside other domestic priorities. \nFurthermore, a series of emergency munitions provisions in the NDAA are intended to speed up the process by waiving multiple restrictions on Pentagon procurement authorities while allowing it to use multi-year contracts typically reserved for large programs, like Navy vessels and major aircraft.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This procurement is being approved under wartime procurement powers.

Until 2020, he displayed in his home a portrait of a Jewish gunman who in 1994 shot dead 29 Palestinians inside a mosque. \nThe Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, quickly released a rare public letter warning soldiers against getting involved in politics, while the soldier was sent to military jail for several days. \n“Soldiers are prohibited from expressing political views,” General Kochavi wrote. “They are certainly prohibited from behaving and acting out of political inclination,” he added.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Israeli politics is always in turmoil.",
