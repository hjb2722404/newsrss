The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

I think there are two entirely contradictory forces right now acting on Putin. On one hand, there is some sort of deal, whether that means he has to give Prigozhin some of what he wants, which is probably more autonomy, more backup, less dependence on the Ministry of Defense, which is who has been struggling with for the last couple of weeks,\" they said.\nOn the other hand, according to the author, Putin still has to make sure \"to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\"So he needs to crack down on the people who supported Prigozhin, on Prigozhin himself and people who have encountered Prigozhin's forces in places that they have made it to in the last 24 hours. For, example, a large city in southern Russia, the seat of the southern military command in Russia, where, as they're packing up to leave, according to .. reporting from there, people are applauding and saying thank you.\"\nGessen asks how Putin is \"going to balance these two completely contradictory\" positions.\n\nWatch below or click the link.",

          "description": "President Putin delivers an address to the nation © Sputnik / Gavriil Grigorov \nZero Hedge: Putin Reassures Allies In Phone Calls, Erdogan Expresses 'Full Support' Against Coup \nRussian President Vladimir Putin is seeking to reassure regional allies that he will crush the Wagner uprising now threatening the military and government, and will maintain a stable Russia. \nIn what's being described as his first international phone call since the Wagner mutiny began, which is grabbing the attention of Western governments, Putin spoke to his Belarus ally, President Alexander Lukashenko. \"The president of Russia called the president of Belarus this morning, there was a phone conversation,\" Belarusian state media confirmed. \"Vladimir Putin informed his Belarusian colleague about the situation in Russia.\"\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: It must have been a tough day for Putin to call his foreign allies and tell them that he is control when tens of thousands of Russian troops had to be deployed onto the streets of Moscow to counter a convoy of Wagner forces. \nFortunately for Putin, some of his allies like the Turkish and Egyptian Presidents, know what it is like to experience a coup.\n But the country that really counts is China, and so far they have said nothing. But Chinese state media have reported extensively  on this crisis, and they have expressed complete confidence that Putin will not only survive this insurrection, but come out stronger .... Putin vows to take ‘decisive actions’ against rebellious Wagner (Global Times). \nAs to what is my take. \nThis is a huge win for the West, because it gives substance to the Western media narrative that Putin is weak and Russia is not stable. Bottom line. The job of the US State Department and EU Foreign ministries to convince governments on the fence to edge away from Russia just got a little bit easier.\n\nUpdate: The Duran predicted this months ago. Their analysis on this crisis (video below) was made before Prigozhin agreed to disengage his forces, but it is still a must see.",

But he had no choice. I know that outside of Moscow there is a huge military base with tens of thousands of soldiers present with heavy armor, and this morning they were all ordered out of their base and deployed to destroy Prigozhin's approaching convoy at all costs. And in Rostov where Prigozhin was holed up, a massive Chechen force with Russian special forces were approaching the city to attack and evict him out of the military base that he was in. \nBottom line. Receiving little if any public support and no support from any Russian military unit Prigozhin had to cut a deal. \nSo what is next? \nPrigozhin will be exiled to Belarus, but he will be closely watched and his movements and communications will be severely restricted. \nThe Wagner fighters who initially refused to participate in Prigozhin's \"march\" will sign contracts with the Defense Ministry. \nThere will be no changes in the Russian Ministry of Defense as demanded by Prigozhin. \nBelarus President Lukashenko is the big winner in this crisis. \nThis is a big wake-up call for Putin. \nThe vast majority of Russians understand why this war is being fought, and they support it. But they are not supporting the strategy on how to fight it. My fear is that Putin, in order to placate the growing impatience with the pace of the war, is going to significantly escalate the war that will include the use of strategic bombers as well as expanding what targets the Russian military will be permitted to destroy.",
