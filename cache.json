          "description": "Zero Hedge: Visualizing The Coming Shift In Global Economic Power (2006-2036)` \nAs the post-pandemic recovery chugs along, the global economy is set to see major changes in the coming decades. Most significantly, China is forecast to pass the United States to become the largest economy globally. \nThe world’s economic center has long been drifting from Europe and North America over to Asia. This global shift was kickstarted by lowered trade barriers and greater economic freedom, which attracted foreign direct investment (FDI). Another major driving factor was the improvements in infrastructure and communications, and a general increase in economic complexity in the region.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I agree on who will be on top (i.e. China).

Today, however, the prospect of nuclear weapons use is perhaps greater than any time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. \nJust weeks after co-signing the joint statement on preventing nuclear war, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a war of aggression against a neighbor that had given up its nuclear weapons in return for Russia’s explicit assurance “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine [and] refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine.”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I grew up during the Cold War.
