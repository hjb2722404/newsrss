He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.\nAuthorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.\nInitial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.\nBy Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.\n\"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening,\" one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.\n\"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification.\"\nEarly on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.\n(Reporting by Liz Lee, Bernard Orr and Ethan Wang; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Clarence Fernandez)",

And It’s OK with That.\n\n \nSpace Force leaders say carefully written contracts can prevent things like SpaceX’s about-face on Ukrainian satcomms. \nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado—The U.S. Space Force is not concerned about relying on mercurial billionaires to provide space capabilities, according to top service leaders. \nThe service’s ability to put large satellites in space rests primarily on the shoulders of Elon Musk, whose SpaceX test-flew a new heavy-lift rocket for the first time on Thursday, and Jeff Bezos, whose Blue Origin is slated to deliver engines to United Launch Alliance. \nA potential problem is illustrated by Musk’s behavior toward Ukraine. In the months that followed Russia’s invasion, SpaceX donated some 20,000 of its satellite internet terminals and millions of dollars’ worth of service to the Ukrainian military. But in October, SpaceX wrote the Pentagon that it would cease its subsidy. Three months after that, Starlink officials said they had taken steps to hinder Ukraine’s use of the terminals on the battlefield; Musk declared, in apparent contradiction of Starlink’s work for the Pentagon, that the service was “never intended to be weaponized.” Ukrainian and Pentagon officials have said they would seek alternatives to Starlink.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: It all comes down to cost. SpaceX has brought down the price of launching rockets by a factor of 10x. That saves the Pentagon hundreds of millions, if not billions, over the next few years.",
