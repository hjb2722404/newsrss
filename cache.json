But amid a cold snap and gas shortages, the population has been paralysed by sub-zero temperatures in many regions around the country. These gas shortages have not only led to widespread power cuts, but also severe air pollution from burning low-grade heavy fuel oil, known as mazut, to make up the difference. Despite denials from authorities, the FRANCE 24 Observers team found evidence that this fuel oil is partially responsible for the “unbreathable” air in some Iranian cities.",

          "description": "Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.\nOffensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.\nThierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.\n\"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination,\" Murangira said.\n\"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB.\"\n\"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime.\"\nRwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.\nUnder Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.\nAnyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.\nMukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\nIt was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.\nThe 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.\n© 2023 AFP",

The government said it will soon deploy police and soldiers to clear the roadblocks.\nLawmakers already agreed last month to bring forward elections from 2026 to April 2024.\nIn the face of relentless protests, Bolu…",

However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,\" added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a \"quagmire.\"\nBut protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.\nIn seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.\nSome of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.\nThose southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.\nAs well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.\nThat resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.\n(AFP)",

          "description": "Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.\nThe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has moved its Doomsday Clock forward to 90 seconds before midnight.\nThe clock has been maintained since 1947 and is used as a metaphor for the likelihood that we'll blow ourselves up. Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, \"It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age.\"\nIn 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs. Today it's…",

The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.\"\nThe asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Colin Kaepernick targets Kevin McCarthy's crime-ridden California district\nThe rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.\nBy comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.",

Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” \nI question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages.

President Joe Biden announced the transfer of 31 Abrams to thwart an anticipated Russian spring offensive and galvanize European allies. \nFighting this winter has been described by a senior U.S. military official as \"savage,\" likening it to World War I trench warfare. \nAnalysts expect Russia to mount what could be a fierce offensive in a campaign to end Ukraine’s string of battlefield successes in recent months and reverse the heavy troop and territorial losses Russia suffered in the first year of fighting. \nSince the war began, the White House and Pentagon have sought to supply Ukraine with the weapons it needs to resist President Vladimir Putin's aggression without sparking a wider war in Europe. Yet Biden's announcement Wednesday also signals that the war, launched with a militarily unprovoked invasion and soon to enter its second year, shows no sign of ending.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: For someone who says he wants to avoid a wider war, this will only escalate it further.",
