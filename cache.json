I know places in Canada would love to have you,\" Trudeau said in a message on Twitter Wednesday evening that quickly went viral. \"So, don't make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.\"\nThe artist had just announced the addition of new dates to her consistently sold-out Eras Tour, which began in March in Arizona.\nShe plans more than 100 concerts through the summer of 2024 -- in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia, but none in Canada.\nThe bad blood risks turning Swift into something of an anti-hero in famously nice Canada. Last month, a conservative lawmaker lamented what he called the singer's lack of respect for his country and similarly implored her to save some dates for Canada.\nSwift last came to Canada in 2018.",
