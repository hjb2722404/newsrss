By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

While not directly critical of Russia, their interventions on the second day of a summit were more concerted and forceful than those that African countries have voiced until now. They served as reminders of the depth of African concern at the consequences of the war, especially rising food prices. \"This war must end. And it ...",

          "description": "General Abdourahamane Tchiani is the new leader of Niger following a military takeover, state television reported Friday, two days after the country’s president was detained by members of his own guard.\nTchiani, the head of the Presidential Guard, has been named \"president of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland,\" a statement said.\nAppearing on state television, the general said soldiers had seized power to the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel country.\nThe country’s elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, has been detained by the putschists since Wednesday morning.\nEarlier on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron described the coup as \"dangerous\" for the region as Western powers scramble to preserve a key ally in the insurgent-stricken Sahel.\n\"This coup is completely illegitimate and profoundly dangerous, for Nigeriens, for Niger and for the whole region,\" Macron said.\nMacron said he had spoken to Bazoum, who is being held in his palace, and called for him to be reinstated.\nNiger's government had been seen by many in the international community as a bulwark against Islamist militancy in a vast, arid region that is beset by security challenges.\nFrench and UN troops were in recent years forced to withdraw from neighboring Mali, but Paris still has 1,500 soldiers in Niger. Bazoum's overthrow could put the future of their deployment in doubt.\nMacron, speaking during a visit to Papua New Guinea, said it was imperative that the constitutional order be restored and vowed to support regional groupings like ECOWAS in mediation or sanctions against putschists.\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, Reuters)",

But this is nature, and it is a natural phenomenon that we do understand very little about.\"\nScientists do not fully understand why mass strandings occur, but pilot whales -- which can grow to more than six meters (20 feet) long -- are highly sociable, so they may follow pod-mates who stray into danger.",

Another incident occurred Wednesday over northwest Syria and resulted in damage to one of the drone’s wings. \nThat makes for a reported total of six incidents involving Russian and American aircraft in July. The confrontations were a reminder of the potential dangers of U.S. and Russian forces operating in close proximity to each other in Syria, and they raise the question of why U.S. forces are still operating in a country where they have no legal mandate. \nRead more .... \nRussia And U.S. Tensions Escalating In The Skies Over Syria\n\n \nRussia, U.S. Inch Toward Direct Conflict in Middle East -- Newsweek\n \nRussian fighter jets stirring up trouble, US combat drones pay price -- Business Insider\n \nRussia says US-led coalition violated Syrian airspace 8 times in 1 day -- Anadolu Agency\n \nRussia Blames US MQ-9 Reaper Drone For Locking Missiles, Almost Crashing Into Su-34, Su-35 Fighters Over Syria -- EurAsian Times\n \nRussian Fighter Damages a Second MQ-9 Over Syria.

The claim, it added, is based on “credible intelligence.” \n\"In his attempt to eliminate Klitschko politically, Zelensky is showing authoritarian traits,” write the report’s authors. \"It is very likely that Western states will exert pressure on the president and his entourage in this regard.\"\n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: President Zelensky has banned all major opposition parties and some of its leaders are in jail.

Russian drones circled overhead while Moscow’s ground forces fired heavy machine guns to flush out Ukrainians from foxholes hidden in the dappled light of the pine forest. \nAs exploding artillery shells shook the ground around him on Saturday morning, Vlad, a 27-year-old Ukrainian drone operator, spotted a Russian armored personnel carrier bringing more troops to the battle. It was a possible prelude, he said, to another assault. \n“They are constantly attacking us,” said Lt. Col. Matviychuk Oleh, a 49-year-old battalion commander with Ukraine’s 100th Territorial Defense Brigade. “They are looking for a weak place and then they storm.”\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: This report makes the New York Times the first major Western news outlet yo admit that there is a major Russian counteroffensive in northeast Ukraine. WNU has been reporting on this offensive for the past few days. \nAnd while the New York Times is saying that Russian advances are minor and being accomplished at great costs, I am reading reports frm sources that I trust that the Ukraine front-lines along this part of the front have collapsed, the Ukraine army is withdrawing, and that in some cases Russian forces have advanced over 10km along a major section of the front. \nThis is the first major Russian offensive since the start of the war. It involves over 100,000 soldiers, heavily backed by armor and air superiority. \nHere is an easy prediction. I expect more Western coverage in the coming days.",
