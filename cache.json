          "description": "When the pandemic closings hit the real estate sector, showings were halted, homes were taken off the market and municipal offices that process closing documents were closed.  As a result, in March 2020, almost 18% of purchase contracts in the United States were canceled – although it took only a few months to return to normal levels.\nBut in 2022, the frequency of canceled transactions started to rise again, reaching almost 15% in June – the highest rate since the peak of the pandemic, according to a recent report by red finwhich represents approximately 60,000 failed home sales across the country.\nThe likely culprit: rising mortgage interest rates.  The journey between the accepted offer and the closing day can take up to two months or more, and interest rates sometimes change in the meantime.  Buyers can lock in rates for certain periods, but not all do, and even a small increase can stretch monthly payments out of reach and kill a deal.  And the rate increases this year have been substantial.  Consider, for example, that the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose from 3.79% in January to 5.3% in July.  This change would increase a monthly payment approximately $90 for every $100,000 borrowed.\n\n\nThe places with the highest percentage of deals failed in June – including many in the south and southwest – are among the most popular with buyers.  In Las Vegas, just over 27% of trades failed in June, the highest rate of any market, according to Redfin.  Preferred Florida destinations followed, including Lakeland, Florida at just under 27% and Cape Coral, Florida at just under 26%.\n\n\nThis week’s chart shows the US metropolitan markets where the highest share of trades failed in June.\n\nSource Link",

But his other conditions caused immense financial pressure.\nBy June, she had reached Medicare’s threshold for catastrophic coverage after paying more than $7,000 for Enbrel, a drug she takes for arthritis;  Synthroid, which she takes for Graves’ disease;  Eliquis, for atrial fibrillation, insulin and its insulin pump.\n“It’s about thinking ahead, looking for alternatives and strategizing for the home budget so that you can take the necessary medications,” she said.  Learning to cope with costs, she added, has been like “a baptism by fire, learning everything I can possibly learn about managing drug costs and staying healthy without complications.”\nThe drug carousel taken by Mr Spring, the dementia patient who died in April, included sky-high prices for drugs including Eliquis, for heart disease, and Namenda, an Alzheimer’s drug.
