          "description": "Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan will be tried in jail in the cipher case, as authorities cited security concerns and did not present him for a hearing at a normal court. The trial was previously held in the high-security Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, but the Islamabad High Court ruled against it. The special court in Islamabad approved Khan's jail trial in an open-court format at the next hearing. Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi have pleaded not guilty to the charges in the cipher case.",

The book is set in a dystopian Dublin in the grips of totalitarianism. Some of the themes of \"Prophet Song\" are eerily similar to the riots that broke out in Dublin last week. \"Prophet Song\" also echoes the violence in Palestine, Ukraine and Syria, and the experience of all those who flee from war-torn countries. The author speaks to FRANCE 24's culture editor Eve Jackson about winning the most prestigious literature prize in the English-speaking world, writing the Irish offspring of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" – and what he's spending his prize money on.",

          "description": "A rare nugget of information about the famously enigmatic street art superstar Banksy emerged Tuesday when he gave his first name as \"Robbie\" in an unearthed 2003 BBC interview.\nIn the interview, one of the few known to exist with the global art phenomenon, he is asked if his name \"Robert Banks\", to which he replies: \"It's Robbie.\"\nHis identity has long been the source of speculation, with some claiming his name was Robin or Robert Banks.\nBanksy talks about his distinctive stencilling style in the interview, a podcast bonus part of a series called \"The Banksy Story\".\n\"It's quick... I want to get it done and dusted,\" he is heard to say of his work.\nThe artist was in his 20s at the time, and was promoting the opening of his \"Turf War\" show in east London.\nThe series also contains a 2005 interview the artist purportedly gave with US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR).\nIn it, the host asks: \"We assume that you are who you say you are, but how can we be sure?\" The interviewee responds: \"Oh, you have no guarantee of that at all.\"\nBanksy, known to hail from Bristol in southwest England, boasts an A-list client list and has sold his works for tens of millions of pounds at auction since achieving notoriety in the early 2000s.",

Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Bartiromo openly asked, \"Is there a chance that China released this virus on America intentionally?\"\nIn fact, there is no evidence of a Chinese plot to deliberately release a virus that spread all across the globe, not just in the United States, and that wound up killing millions of people, including an unquantified number of Chinese citizens.\nALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.\nRegardless, Bartiromo went on to say that the goal of the Chinese government may have been to \"disrupt\" America to \"get Donald Trump out, get your man in there, Joe Biden.\"\nWenstrup didn't explicitly endorse Bartiromo's theory, although he did leave open the possibility that the virus was released \"accidentally.\"\nWatch the video below or at this link.\n\n\n\n\n —  (@)",

By 1942, Japanese naval aviation was in decline because “the navy had simply produced too few fliers.” The U.S. military bested superb Japanese pilots by flooding the skies quickly with good enough ones. The Japanese navy never recovered from the loss of over 100 trained naval aviators during the Battle of Midway, followed by the decimation of its remaining aviation competency at the Battle of the Philippine Sea.  Today, the U.S.\nThe post Air Samurai: Is Naval Aviation Overtraining Pilots in the Age of Automation? appeared first on War on the Rocks.",

That strategy, however, has now been called into question.

William Walldorf, Jr., Real Clear Wire: Time to Drawdown From Syria \nAs part of the fallout from the war in Gaza, U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq have come under attack more than fifty times from Iranian-backed militias since early October.  At least fifty-six military personnel have been injured. In response, the U.S. launched retaliatory air strikes and has sent about 900 more troops to the region. \nThis bolstering of forces is the wrong move. In fact, the U.S. is overdue to drawdown its forces from Syria. \nWhy drawdown completely?  The answer is simple.  The small contingent of U.S. forces in Syria, especially, are sitting ducks for further attacks in support of missions where the costs of continuing those missions now far outstrip their strategic benefits.  Recent attacks bring this mismatch between costs and benefits into sharp relief.  These incidents should also serve as a warning for potential dangers if U.S. policy fails to change course.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The U.S. is not going to withdraw any of its forces from Syria.
