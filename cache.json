I mean, you know, you just wonder what's wrong with these people, if they have to do everything in secret,\" she said.\n\"It's just utterly inappropriate.

The Lockup, a chain of haunted prison eateries, ended a 23-year run when its final location closed last month, joining the fate of the famous Robot Restaurant, a gaudy music and dance spectacle in the red-light district of Kabukicho that closed in March 2020.\n(Reporting by Irene Wang and Rocky Swift; Editing by William Mallard)",

However, activists complain that golf courses are allowed to continue watering greens.\nThe protest action took place at the Vieille-Toulouse club and also at the Garonne des Sept Deniers course.\nDefending their exemption from the water restrictions, Gerard Rougier of the French Golf Federation told the France Info news website: \"A golf course without a green is like an ice-rink without ice.\"\nExtinction Rebellion Toulouse posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing a golf hole filled with cement and a sign saying \"This hole is drinking 277,000 litres. Do you drink that much? #Stop Golf\".\nA petition aimed at scrapping the exemption enjoyed by French golf courses during drought said: \"Economic madness takes precedence over ecological reason.\"\nWater bans are enforced at the discretion of regional officials and so far only Ille-et-Villaine in western France had banned the watering of golf courses.\nFrance had been one of the hardest hit by the hot and dry conditions across Europe with firefighters battling a \"monster\" blaze in forests in the southwest France.\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)",

Yet too many institutions continue to discriminate in the name of redressing discrimination.

          "description": "Bad Bunny reclaims No. 1 on the Billboard album chart by the slimmest of margins this week, as the Puerto Rican superstar’s three-month-old album “Un Verano Sin Ti” recorded its eighth time at the top, beating the last release of the prolific Louisiana rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again by only 400 copies.\n‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, a consistent streaming hit since its release 14 weeks ago, is credited with the equivalent of 108,800 sales in the US, while YoungBoy’s ‘The Last Slimeto’ had 108,400. according to Luminate tracking service.\nLooking Under the Hood shows slight differences in the performance of the two albums over the past week.  “Un Verano” had 143 million streams, which Luminate and Billboard attribute to the equivalent of just over 102,000 sales.  “The Last Slimeto,” on the other hand, took significantly more streams — 163 million — to earn just 1,000 more equivalent sales.\n\n\nBillboard gives more weight to streams from paying subscribers than non-paying ones.  The tea leaves data suggests that YoungBoy may have performed particularly well on services with free tiers like Spotify and YouTube, where YoungBoy has been a huge attraction for years.\n\n\nEven so, the deciding factor in winning No. 1 was the number of copies sold in a complete package.  Last week, the CD version of “Un Verano” became widely available, so the album sold 6,000 copies, while “The Last Slimeto” only sold 4,600.\n“Rebirth” by Beyoncé best seller last week, falling two places to No. 3 in its second week, with the equivalent of 89,000 sales, a drop of 73%.  Beyoncé’s single “Break My Soul” topped the Hot 100 chart, thanks to a “Queens Remix” which incorporates Madonna’s 1990 hit “Vogue” and features Beyoncé tweaking her predecessor’s song screams to include black musicians such as Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Aaliyah and Lizzo.\nMorgan Wallen’s ‘Dangerous: The Double Album’ is No. 4 and Harry Styles’ ‘Harry’s House’ is No. 5.\n\nSource Link",

I caught myself choking almost for a moment when you asked that.

I think it may have affected me in that I’m a bit more patient.  Maybe it comes with age anyway.\nWas there ever a time when you had a script and thought, “Mike wouldn’t do that”?\nThere were times when I was like, “Oh, I don’t think Mike would do that.”  But I found, quite honestly, often that what the writers told me, if I relied on them, made sense.\nThe first thing that comes to mind is in “Breaking Bad” when Mike left his granddaughter in the park and had to escape.  And I was like, ‘No, Mikey would never leave his granddaughter.  And of course the reasoning is that the police department – ​​they’re right there in the park.  They will take care of her, they will return her to her mother.  I still have trouble with Mike leaving his granddaughter in the park.\nThere’s a scene in “Better Call Saul” last season where Mike reads “The Little Prince” to his granddaughter, Kaylee.  It is a passage where the little prince says: “My flower is ephemeral, and it has only four thorns to defend itself against the world.  What do you think this scene means for Mike?\n\nSource Link",
