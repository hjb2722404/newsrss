But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France's envoy to Niger is living like a hostage in the French embassy and accused military rulers of blocking food deliveries to the mission.\nThe ambassador is living off \"military rations\", Macron told reporters in the eastern town of Semur-en-Auxois.\n\"As we speak, we have an ambassador and diplomatic staff who are literally being held hostage in the French embassy,\" he said.\n\"They are preventing food deliveries,\" he said, in an apparent reference to Niger's new military rulers. \"He is eating military rations.\"\nNiger's military leaders told French ambassador Sylvain Itte he had to leave the country after they overthrew President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26.\nBut a 48-hour ultimatum for him to leave, issued in August, passed with him still in place as the French government refused to comply, or to recognise the military regime as legitimate.\nThe coup has been condemned by France and most of Niger's neighbors.\nMacron said the envoy \"cannot go out, he is persona non grata and he is being refused food\".\nAsked whether France would consider bringing him home, Macron said: \"I will do whatever we agree with President Bazoum because he is the legitimate authority and I speak with him every day.\"\nFrance keeps about 1,500 soldiers in Niger, and said earlier this month that any redeployment could only be negotiated with Bazoum.\nThe country's new leaders have torn up military cooperation agreements with France and asked the troops to leave quickly.\nMacron has for weeks rejected the call to remove the French ambassador, a stance backed by the EU which has described the demand as \"a provocation\".\nLike France, said EU foreign affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali last month, the EU \"does not recognize\" the authorities that seized power in Niger.\nThe impoverished Sahel region south of the Sahara, has suffered what Macron has called an \"epidemic\" of coups in recent years, with military regimes replacing elected governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea as well as Niger.\n(AFP)",
