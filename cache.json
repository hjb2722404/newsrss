Iraq has been without a president and prime minister for a record period because of the deadlock.\nSadr maintains large state power himself because his movement remains involved in running the country - his loyalists sit in powerful positions throughout Iraqi ministries and state bodies.\nIraqis linked neither to Sadr nor to his opponents say they are caught in the middle of the political gridlock.\nWhile Baghdad earns record income from its vast oil wealth, the country has no budget, regular power and water cuts, poor education and healthcare, and insufficient job opportunities for the young.\n(Reporting by Reuters TV in Baghdad and Amina Ismail in Erbil; Writing by John Davison; Editing by Helen Popper)",

          "description": "LONDON — It started as an Instagram-linked feud between the spouses of two British soccer stars and turned into a libel suit that provided a welcome distraction for a nation in turmoil.\nThe High Court on Friday ended the long-running legal wrangle by ruling against plaintiff Rebekah Vardy, saying she had not been defamed by her former friend Coleen Rooney.\nIn the verdict, Judge Karen Steyn ruled that the reputational damage suffered by Ms Vardy lacked what she described as “the sting of defamation”.  For that reason, she said in a written decision released Friday, “the matter is closed.”\n\n\nThe judge also reprimanded Ms Vardy, who sued Ms Rooney in June 2020, writing that she had regularly leaked information about her former friend to the press, adding that “significant parts of her evidenc…",

          "description": "Since “Lemonade” (2016), her last solo studio album and accompanying film, Beyoncé has overwhelmed fans with a number of ambitious in-between projects.\nIn 2018, she performed as one of the headliners of the Coachella festival, where her show honored the tradition of historically black college and university marching bands, and was widely hailed as a triumph — one that “redirected its music, discarding its ties to pop and framing it squarely in a line of Southern black musical traditions,” as New York Times critic Jon Caramanica wrote.  The performance was later made into a Netflix special and an album, both titled “Homecoming.”\nAlso in 2018, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, her husband, released a joint album, “All is love” credited to the Carters.  And in June 2020, at the height of nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd, she released a song, “Black Parade”, with lines like “Put your fist up, show black love.”\n“Black Parade” won the Grammy Award the following year for Best R&B Performance, one of four prizes that night it took Beyoncé’s career to 28 – more than any other woman.  This year, Beyoncé was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song for “Be Alive,” from the movie “King Richard,” a biopic about Venus and Serena Williams’ father.\nHow the early leak will affect the commercial prospects of “Renaissance” remains unclear.  Years ago, the unauthorized release of music in advance could have devastating consequences for an album.  But that danger has been mitigated by the move to streaming.\nAnd Beyoncé, like most other artists today, has taken advance orders for physical copies of her album, which will count on the charts as soon as they ship — usually the week of release.  On Beyoncé’s site, all four boxes of “Renaissance” and its limited-edition vinyl version are sold out.\n\nSource Link",

They had just come from three weeks off and were back in company class, preparing for a tour of upstate New York.  Some carried energy drinks and bottles of hand sanitizer;  others brought their dogs, who sat under the barre as the dancers began a series of exercises – bends, stretches, jumps and pirouettes.\nTall and majestic, Chun Wai Chan stood near the center of the studio.  In May, he became the first Chinese-born principal dancer in City Ballet’s 74-year history, only the fourth Asian to hold the rank.  In the studio that morning, some dancers were still loosening up their routines.  But he was brimming with energy, vowin…",

Globally, more than 20,600 cases have been confirmed in 77 countries.  Of that, more than 20,300 have been confirmed in countries that have never reported monkeypox infections.\n\nIn response to the increase in numbers, our government has issued a familiar appeal to the public.\n\n“The international community must work together to protect those who have been affected by monkeypox, and those most at risk of contracting the virus,” said Whi…",
