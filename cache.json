The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.\n\"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy,\" said Austin. \"I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.\"\n\"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"That's our policy,\" said Austin.\nWatch below or click here.\n\n\nLloyd Austin calls on Tommy Tuberville to drop military block\n\nwww.youtube.com",

An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.\nHis attorney said that he had been \"eaten alive.\"\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates \"do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.\" \n“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,\" she said. \nClarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a \"racial justice issue,\" citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail. \nRead the full report at The Washington Post.",

It was also simply baffling. A rebellion had been launched by Russians themselves against the chief institutions of their state. Yet, as the rebels were closing in on Moscow, their leader suddenly withdrew his forces and called off the mutiny. The Prigozhin affair was indeed a momentous, puzzling event.

The ability to engage targets at operational and strategic depth critically enables the conduct of offensive and defensive maneuvers and can shape the conditions for victory on the battlefield.  Yet, as a result of structural underfunding and different procurement priorities, European states have long ignored the shift towards stand-off range and precision strike in modern war. This has resulted in European missile arsenals not fit for purpose for high-intensity warfare.

The shock of invasion has expanded NATO’s ranks and galvanized unprecedented transatlantic security cooperation.

On a modern battlefield, where long-range weapons can reach far behind the frontlines and drones constantly roam overhead, protecting aircraft from the enemy is hard. \nSo Western air forces are increasingly focused on dispersing their operations.
