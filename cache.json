Avdiivka has been a focal point of fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces since 2014. Ukrainian President Zelensky confirmed that his forces are mounting defensive actions in Avdiivka. While there are concerns that Russian forces may be regrouping for another wave of attacks, Ukraine claims to be largely in control. Both sides have struggled to make significant progress on the battlefield in recent months.",

As joblessness among young Chinese reaches record highs, hostels provide a place for individuals to stay between interviews and strategize for their next networking meeting. The hypercompetitive nature of China's white-collar job market, combined with a slowing economy, has made it increasingly difficult for young people to secure well-paying jobs. Even those who have found employment often struggle to afford housing. The situation has worsened in recent years, with fewer job offers available.",

          "description": "The US Federal Reserve has decided to maintain interest rates at a 22-year high for the second consecutive meeting in an effort to control inflation without harming the strong economy. The Fed aims to cool down demand and encourage companies to slow down price increases. Despite the economy's resilience, inflation has gradually decreased from its peak in 2022. The Fed is focused on bringing inflation back in line with its 2% target and is considering whether to implement one final rate increase in the coming months.",

          "description": "During his fraud trial, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was questioned about his relationship with Bahamian officials. The prosecutor sought to link favors done for the officials with Bankman-Fried's decision to allow FTX customers in the Bahamas to withdraw funds after withdrawals for others had been halted. Bankman-Fried, who is facing charges of fraud and conspiracy, denied offering to pay off the Bahamas' national debt but admitted to offering a job to the son of the Bahamian prime minister. He also stated that he could not recall whether he gave the prime minister and his wife seats at a Miami Heat game.",

          "description": "A new poll shows that President Joe Biden's support among Arab Americans has dropped significantly, from 59% in 2020 to just 17% now. This decline in support is attributed to growing anger over Biden's support for Israel's attacks on Gaza. The poll also reveals that a majority of Arab Americans no longer identify as Democrats, with 32% identifying as Republicans and 31% as independents. The poll highlights the challenge Biden may face in winning over key Arab American voters.",

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",
