I mean, you know, you just wonder what's wrong with these people, if they have to do everything in secret,\" she said.\n\"It's just utterly inappropriate.

The Lockup, a chain of haunted prison eateries, ended a 23-year run when its final location closed last month, joining the fate of the famous Robot Restaurant, a gaudy music and dance spectacle in the red-light district of Kabukicho that closed in March 2020.\n(Reporting by Irene Wang and Rocky Swift; Editing by William Mallard)",

          "description": "Bad Bunny reclaims No. 1 on the Billboard album chart by the slimmest of margins this week, as the Puerto Rican superstar’s three-month-old album “Un Verano Sin Ti” recorded its eighth time at the top, beating the last release of the prolific Louisiana rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again by only 400 copies.\n‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, a consistent streaming hit since its release 14 weeks ago, is credited with the equivalent of 108,800 sales in the US, while YoungBoy’s ‘The Last Slimeto’ had 108,400. according to Luminate tracking service.\nLooking Under the Hood shows slight differences in the performance of the two albums over the past week.  “Un Verano” had 143 million streams, which Luminate and Billboard attribute to the equivalent of just over 102,000 sales.  “The Last Slimeto,” on the other hand, took significantly more streams — 163 million — to earn just 1,000 more equivalent sales.\n\n\nBillboard gives more weight to streams from paying subscribers than non-paying ones.  The tea leaves data suggests that YoungBoy may have performed particularly well on services with free tiers like Spotify and YouTube, where YoungBoy has been a huge attraction for years.\n\n\nEven so, the deciding factor in winning No. 1 was the number of copies sold in a complete package.  Last week, the CD version of “Un Verano” became widely available, so the album sold 6,000 copies, while “The Last Slimeto” only sold 4,600.\n“Rebirth” by Beyoncé best seller last week, falling two places to No. 3 in its second week, with the equivalent of 89,000 sales, a drop of 73%.  Beyoncé’s single “Break My Soul” topped the Hot 100 chart, thanks to a “Queens Remix” which incorporates Madonna’s 1990 hit “Vogue” and features Beyoncé tweaking her predecessor’s song screams to include black musicians such as Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Aaliyah and Lizzo.\nMorgan Wallen’s ‘Dangerous: The Double Album’ is No. 4 and Harry Styles’ ‘Harry’s House’ is No. 5.\n\nSource Link",

Maybe it comes with age anyway.\nWas there ever a time when you had a script and thought, “Mike wouldn’t do that”?\nThere were times when I was like, “Oh, I don’t think Mike would do that.”  But I found, quite honestly, often that what the writers told me, if I relied on them, made sense.\nThe first thing that comes to mind is in “Breaking Bad” when Mike left his granddaughter in the park and had to escape.  And I was like, ‘No, Mikey would never leave his granddaughter.  And of course the reasoning is that the police department – ​​they’re right there in the park.  They will take care of her, they will return her to her mother.  I still have trouble with Mike leaving his granddaughter in the park.\nThere’s a scene in “Better Call Saul” last season where Mike reads “The Little Prince” to his granddaughter, Kaylee.  It is a passage where the little prince says: “My flower is ephemeral, and it has only four thorns to defend itself against the world.  What do you think this scene means for Mike?\n\nSource Link",

Pseudonyms are common;  parody and comedy videos are easily misinterpreted as fact;  popularity affects the visibility of comments;  and the data about posting time and other details are not clearly displayed on the mobile app.\n(Shorenstein Center researchers noted, however, that TikTok is less vulnerable to so-called brigadier, in which groups coordinate to spread a message widely, than platforms like Twitter or Facebook.)\nIn the first quarter of 2022, more than 60% of videos containing harmful misinformation were viewed by users before being deleted, TikTok said.  Last year, a group of behavioral scientists who had worked with TikTok said an effort to attach warnings to posts with unsubstantiated content reduced sharing by 24% but limited views by just 5%.\nThe researchers said misinformation will continue to thrive on TikTok as long as the platform refuses to disclose data about the origins of its videos or share information about its algorithms.  Last month, TikTok said it would offer access to a version of its application programming interface, or API, this year, but it didn’t say whether it would do so until the midterms.\nFilippo Menczer, professor of computer science and computer science and director of the Indiana University Social Media Observatory, said he had offered research collaborations to TikTok and had been told ” Absolutely not”.\n“At least with Facebook and Twitter, there is some level of transparency, but, in the case of TikTok, we have no idea,” he said.  “Without resources, without being able to access the data, we don’t know who is suspended, what content is removed, if it acts on reports or what the criteria are.  It’s completely opaque and we can’t independently assess anything.\n\nSource Link",

In Australia in 2015, for example, the country’s then-endangered species commissioner told the national channel that “Australia has lost 29 mammals since European settlement, and wild predators are implicated in 28 of those extinctions”.\nFlorida faces similar invasion problems as it is home to an ideal combination of a subtropical climate, a thriving pet trade, and multiple ports of entry.  The result, said Ian Bartoszek, a wildlife biologist with the Southwest Florida Conservatory, is that the state has “more established non-native animal species than any country in the world”.

          "description": "The evening, punctuated by the local cover band, the Fly Bettys, ended with a final fireworks display accompanied by “God Bless the USA”.\nThe hope of SK, Ford, many energy policymakers and pragmatic environmentalists is that most Georgians stalking for holiday fireworks in years to come will instead be hanging from F-150 sets. Lightnings.\nEven with logistics and production volume straightened out, the lingering question for Jackson County residents and Americans alike is whether batteries made on the road in SK will power vehicles ultimately as accessible as Ford’s Model T.  Henry Ford called it a vehicle “for the great multitude,” and it fueled America’s original automobile revolution.\nAs usual, silver bullets are rare.  And like most major challenges, it helps if a solution is to create something cool.\nMaddison Dean, a Jackson County native, was hired earlier this year by SK for a community relations role.  In April, she gave a presentation on the company to over a hundred juniors and seniors at Commerce High School, her alma mater.  In the auditorium, she provided insight into electric vehicles, the rapidly changing future of automakers, and how SK operations work.\n“I told them, feel free to interrupt me anytime, just raise your hand,” she said.  At first, she didn’t have many takers.  “You know, especially talking to high school kids, they’re just sort of transparent, they’re like, ‘Yeah, whatever, that’s an excuse for us to be out of class, but we don’t lend it don’t pay attention.  “”\n\nSource Link",

And I found, to my surprise, that learning about baby equipment forced me to learn more about babies themselves – what they like, what they don’t like, to how old they grow and come out of certain behaviors.  As my due date approached, I felt more prepared and less unhappy than many other future dads I met in our birthing classes, many of whom had outsourced equipment decisions to their wives.\nAnd when my wife finally gave birth three weeks early, I was ready.  I drove her to the hospital with confidence, full bags in tow, not once worrying about whether the car seat was properly installed.\nSince the birth of our son, I have found that my interest in his equipment has made me a be…",

They have overcome boardroom clashes, investor power struggles and regulatory landmines.\nBut this summer, some of them encountered their most threatening adversary yet: multi-family townhouses.\nTheir battle took place in one of the most exclusive and affluent cities in Silicon Valley: Atherton, California., a 4.9 square mile enclave just north of Stanford University with a population of 7,500.  There, tech CEOs and venture capitalists coalesced on the spectrum that more than one home might exist on a single acre of land in general proximity to their estates.\n\n\nTheir weapon?
