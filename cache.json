They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.\nAbdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking.

This meeting, which precedes a May 21 summit between Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden, reflects Yoon’s view that North Korea is the South’s “main enemy.”\nYoon’s presidency comes at a tumultuous time in U.S. foreign policy. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine continues, and it enjoys Chinese support. Strategic competition is expanding with Beijing in the Indo-Pacific. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has conducted 16 missile tests in 2022 so far. Raising the possibility of internal instability in North Korea is the COVID-19 outbreak that Kim has finally admitted to, after more than two years of claiming zero cases in the country.\nIn this context, the South Korea-U.S. alliance remains as important as ever. The upcoming summit provides an opportunity not only to reaffirm the alliance at the start of the Yoon administration, but also to build on the ROK-U.S. vision laid out in the May 2021 summit.\nDave Maxwell\nMon, 05/16/2022 - 11:58am\n\nRead more about Recommendations for Yoon-Biden Summit – Must Build on the Strong Alliance Foundation\nLog in or register to post comments",

Most free throws, almost 80% of them, are successful.  So why bother boxing?\nAnd then there’s Miami’s PJ Tucker, a 6-foot-5, 245-pound wrecking ball who spent his career disguised as a power forward.  Consider Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night, as Heat teammate Gabe Vincent lined up for the second of two free throws.  Tucker took advantage of that window to throw most of his body weight into the midsection of Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics.\nIt was a bit much.  One of the referees advised Tucker to cool him down, which he didn’t like.  But that wasn’t going to stop Tucker from playing the only way he knew how to play – hard – …",

          "description": "He is also one of the best players in the NHL in any position.  He was named one of three finalists for the Hart Trophy for most valuable player of the regular season and is almost guaranteed to receive the Vézina Trophy for top goaltender.  All voters needed was his .935 save percentage and 2.07 goals-against average, both league-best.\nShesterkin, 26, was drafted out of Russia by Rangers in the fourth round of the 2014 draft and fit right into a line of Rangers goalkeepers dating back to the early 1990s with Mike Richter, who was followed , two years after his own retirement.  , by Henrik Lundqvist in 2005.\n“What a series of goaltenders we’ve seen here with the Rangers,” said Eddie Olczyk, a TNT analyst and Richter’s teammate on the last Rangers team to win a Stanley Cup, in 1994. It hasn’t been a problem for Rangers, and when you have it, you have a chance to win every night.\nOlczyk said he spoke to Gallant months ago about Shesterkin, and the coach praised him for the goalkeeper’s incredible ability to read, react and get in the right position before the shot or the pass.\n“I don’t think you hear that very often,” Olczyk said.  “He seems to know what’s going to happen first.  When this happens, you are playing five card stud with six cards.  It’s a very good hand to play with.\nLundqvist was like that too.  He was still a Ranger when Shesterkin made his debut on January 7, 2020. Shesterkin spoke very little English then, and it was difficult for Lundqvist to communicate with him in a casual and thorough manner to get a sense of who Shesterkin was.  .  But he noticed his new team-mate was rather relaxed and chatty with other Russian-speaking Rangers players, like Pavel Buchnevich and Vladislav Namestnikov, both of whom are no longer with the team.\nNow a Rangers analyst on the MSG Network, Lundqvist says Shesterkin’s laid-back demeanor was key to the Russian goalkeeper’s ability to withstand pressure and failure – what little he had of it.\n\nSource Link",

Today, in addition to demographic trends that have long eroded the size of rural Iowa school populations, diminishing funding, the district is grappling with inflation as the price of fuel for school buses has soared in arrow, Mr. Lutt said.\nIn some states where schools have avoided distance learning — Florida, for example — enrollment has not only rebounded, but remains robust. Analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank, concluded last month that distance education was a major driver nationwide, with enrollment declining the most in districts most likely to have delayed their return to classrooms in person.\nPrivate schools also recorded enrollment gains.  Federal enrollment counts have yet to be released, but the National Association of Independent Schools and the National Catholic Educational Association have reported increases totaling about 73,000 K-12 students over the past two years.\nAt the same time, some families are leaving their local public schools not because they are dropping out of the system altogether, but because they have moved to other parts of the country that are more affordable.\nEnrollment also increased in rural resort areasdriven by the relocation of tech workers and others able to work remotely, especially after the pandemic took hold.\n\nSource Link",

The first pickaxe should take place soon.\nGoodSpace brokers Chris DeCrosta and Hank O’Donnell said the image isn’t quite final.  “Because this is a customizable building, we’ll market to see if a tenant wants a say in the final design,” DeCrosta said.\nThey target sports brands such as Nike or Adidas, “which could make sales of $40 million to $50 million a year,” DeCrosta said.  O’Donnell added: “It’s a place to do crazy business.”  Brokers refused to quote an asking rent.\nThe area is seeing a meteoric rise in commercial and residential development, including City Point, a new Ace Hotel and giant apartment towers from Extell, JDS and others.\n\nSource Link",

It's set to expire on May 25. \n\"The expectation was for it to be time limited. It’s reasonably likely to expect that the license will be left to expire,\" Yellen said, speaking to reporters in Bonn, Germany, ahead of a G7 finance ministerial meeting. \"A final decision hasn’t been taken yet, but I think it’s unlikely that it would continue.\"   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: US ‘likely’ to scrap Russia debt payment exemption: Yellen (AFP) \nWNU Editor: Russia's next debt payment is on May 27, two days after Moscow will be blocked from making a payment.

It’s managed to make all its payments to creditors so far, weaving through the tangle of sanctions that closed off some avenues. \nThat includes an 11th-hour escape earlier this month, when blocked payments were eventually allowed through after Moscow tapped its domestic dollar reserves.
