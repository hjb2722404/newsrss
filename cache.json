And it will inform her decisions as she guides the school, which was founded in 2019, into a post-pandemic era which promises new opportunities for sports, drama, volunteering, group projects, team competitions and international exchanges.\r \r “We aim to lay a very strong foundation, and that starts in the kindergarten and primary years,” says Woo, noting that Invictus offers a “through-train” system taking children all the way up to Year 13 in secondary. “We follow a spiral curriculum which progressively adds breadth and depth and is also in line with the school’s objective of providing a quality, affordable education which sets high standards and lets students explore their potential.”\r \r \r \r There are two main campuses, with kindergarten and primary classes in Tseung Kwan O and secondary in Chai Wan, where pupils do IGCSEs and A-Levels, using the Cambridge programme.

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

They also say the boat may have been a decoy, put to sea to distract from the true perpetrators, who remain at large, according to officials with knowledge of an investigation led by Germany’s attorney general.
