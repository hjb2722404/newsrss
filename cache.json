Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?\" Blitzer asked.\n \"Oh yeah. he's taking on water,\" Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.\n\"And he's shrinking,\" he continued. \"You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting.\"\n\"And I feel that he's melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, 'You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.' The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman's testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath,\" he said. \"If they don't agree with her story, with what she's been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath.\"\n\"The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It's hard for me to believe in our country we would've had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much.

          "description": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Friday filed an appeal against his extradition to the United States, as supporters denounced the British government.\nAssange, who turns 51 on Sunday, has been held in a high-security prison since 2019.\nOn Friday his wife Stella was among dozens of people who demonstrated outside Britain's interior ministry to demand his release.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition last month, but court officials confirmed to AFP an application to appeal had been received on Friday.\n\"We're not at the end of the road here,\" Stella Assange, who married the Australian publisher earlier this year, told reporters when Patel announced her decision.\n\"We're going to fight this. We're going to use every appeal avenue.\" \nAssange is wanted to face trial for allegedly violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010, related to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.\nHe could face decades in jail if found guilty, but supporters portray him as a martyr to press freedom after he was taken into UK custody following a years-long stay in Ecuador's embassy.\n\"He's been in prison for telling the truth,\" supporter Gloria Wildman, 79, told AFP at Friday's protest.\n\"If Julian Assange is not free, neither are we, none of us is free,\" she said.",

Suddenly a big chunk came out.  With him was the body of a baby woolly mammoth, frozen and preserved with its hair and skin.\n‚ÄúI thought it was a baby buffalo at first,‚Äù said Mudry, 31, from Alberta.  ‚ÄúAnd then I came out, and I was inspecting it, and there was a trunk, so I had no words.‚Äù\n\n\nThe mammoth was dark and shiny, Mr. Mudry said, with short legs and deep, pronounced eye sockets.
