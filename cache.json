As the BBC points out, Antov's death is the latest in a series of unexplained deaths involving Russian tycoons since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last summer Antov denied criticizing the war after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account. Antov's friend, Vladimir Budanov was reported to have had a stroke before he died, but tourist guide Jitendra Singh told reporters that Budanov may have \"consumed a lot of alcohol as he had liquor bottles.\"\nAntov was the founder of the Vladimir Standard meat processing plant. In 2019, Forbes estimated his fortune at some $140 million. \nFrom the BBC: \"Late last June he appeared to react to a Russian missile attack on a residential block in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv that left a man dead and his seven-year-old daughter and her mother wounded. A WhatsApp message on Antov's account described how the family were pulled out of the rubble: 'It's extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror.' The message was deleted and Antov then posted on social media that he was a supporter of the president, a 'patriot of my country' and backed the war.\"\nRead the full report over at the BBC.",

          "description": "Veteran Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will present his new government to parliament this week, the Knesset speaker said on Monday.\nFollowing his November 1 election win, Netanyahu secured a mandate to form a government backed by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and an extreme-right bloc, with the 73-year-old set to resume his old post as prime minister.\n\"The vote for the formation of the government will take place at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) Thursday in a special session of the Knesset,\" parliament speaker Yariv Levin said in a statement.\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said he had formed a new government, returning to power as the head of what analysts call the most right-wing coalition in Israel's history.\nWhile the exact makeup of his cabinet has not yet been released, Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party will govern in partnership with the main ultra-Orthodox parties and members of the extreme bloc that ran under the Religious Zionism alliance.\nLeading voices within the new coalition will include Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, tipped to be national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich of Religious Zionism, set to be handed the portfolio responsible for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.\nBoth live in Israeli settlements, and Ben Gvir has a long history of using incendiary rhetoric against Arabs.\nNetanyahu has also offered a key post to Aryeh Deri, from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, although he currently cannot serve in the cabinet due to past convictions for tax offenses.\nHowever, parliament is expected to pass legislation to remove that obstacle, with the second and third readings of a bill due on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nNetanyahu, who is fighting corruption allegations in court, has already served as premier longer than anyone in Israel, including a 1996 to 1999 stint and a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021.\nHis incoming government has sparked fears of a military escalation in the West Bank amid the worst violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory for nearly 20 years.\n¬© 2022 AFP",
