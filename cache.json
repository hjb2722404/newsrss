          "description": "Hong Kong recently unveiled a list of its best – and worst – public toilets, with the Peak Tower, a shopping complex popular with tourists, winning the gold medal. But the city has another gold standard loo-related achievement, Hong Kong holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive toilet bowl, a golden creation worth HK$27 million (US$3.5 million). The solid-gold “throne” formed part of a gaudy jewellery showroom built using two tonnes of the precious metal which carried an overall price tag US$38 million. Swisshorn Gold Palace, which was also known as The Golden House and the Hall of Gold, was in the city’s Kowloon area and it boasted a floor-to-ceiling gold design, including a gold horse-drawn chariot, gold chandeliers and life-size gold statues. Even the cutlery and crockery was gold.  But behind a door with engraved pharaohs, Greek gods and harp-playing angels, stood the palace’s crown jewel: a fully functional solid gold toilet. After opening to the public in September 2006, it attracted thousands of visitors a day, mostly tourists from mainland China. The venue was also hired out for weddings and corporate events. The man with the Midas touch behind the project was entrepreneur Lam Sai-wing who moved to Hong Kong from Guangdong province in southern China when he was 21 and went on to become chairman of the jewellery-making company Hang Fung Gold Technology.  Lam wanted to build a shrine to his boyhood hero, Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, who had said that after the victory of socialism, gold should be used to make toilets. “It has been my dream to build this since I was 16 years old. Now it has come true,” said Lam in a story published in the Post in 2002. “I’m a capitalist with socialist principles,” he said at the time, adding: “This toilet is for the public, I wouldn’t have one at home.” But in 2008, the economy - and Lam’s company - was hit by the fallout from the global financial crisis. What wasn’t suffering, however, was the price of gold: in 2008 it had reached an all-time record…",

It’s perhaps a natural path for any traitor... He betrayed his entire Soviet past,” he said. “Our weapon-makers are more talented anyway. Our men are more ingenious because we’re Russians—of many different nationalities. God is with us! Either we will win, or humanity will cease to exist, because the Lord won’t stand for the triumph of warriors of the Antichrist. We are the Lord’s weapon, we are his avenging right hand.”\nIN OTHER NEWS: ‘Based on pure speculation’: Defense expert destroys Kari Lake’s case in less than 60 seconds\nWatch the video below:\n\n\\u201cPropagandist Vladimir #Solovyov was triggered by the Ukrainian flag in the U.S. Congress: \"Editorial staff, turn the video off!

They ran the risk of collaborators exposing them to the Russians and being arrested or shot,\" Sky News' report stated. \nREAD MORE: 'The less you remember the better': New transcripts reveal Cassidy Hutchinson interactions with Trump lawyer\nThe Russians never found the orphans, but sent another fifteen children from elsewhere in Ukraine for the orphanage to look after.

It’s also poised to be one of the few nations to increase coal imports next year.\nOn Thursday, utility Uniper SE said it would extend commercial operations of two of its coal-fired plants in Germany until March 2024 at the latest, in an effort to conserve natural gas in the coming winters. \nAcross the globe, highly polluting — and relatively cheap — coal is making a comeback as countries seek to prevent soaring energy costs from triggering an economic meltdown. In Europe, the crisis is acute, after Russia curbed gas supplies in the fallout of its war in Ukraine. Germany is now trying to balance the short-term priority of bolstering energy security with the longer-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2045.\nRead more .... \nUpdate: Energy crisis fuels coal comeback in Germany (Euronews/Reuters) \nWNU Editor: On the one hand we hear German officials praising German efforts to cut gas production .... Germany Has Dramatically Slashed Its Dependence On Russian Gas (OilPrice.com), on the other hand we hear the opposite from other officials .... German regulator: gas consumption up, savings target missed (Reuters). But in this discussion is the uncomfortable truth that coal is making a comeback, and it is making a mockery of Germany's vaunted green energy efforts. \nOne more note. According to German media reports Germany is consuming almost 1% of its natural gas stockpile per-day. That means by the end of March Germany will be out of natural gas, and when it comes to future supplies the country be completely dependent for LNG and what they can get from Norway.",
