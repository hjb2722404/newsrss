The clandestine actions of these ordinary citizens played a key role in the liberation of Kherson. Driven only by their conscience, these Ukrainian men and women managed to thwart the Kremlin's plans to annex their region to Russia. Behind Russian lines, Gwendoline Debono was also able to gain access to a Ukrainian military unit responsible for conducting military operations in enemy territory.",

Both sides have since accused each other of espionage.\nTaiwan, a self-governed democracy claimed by China, said last week that it had found the remains of a suspected Chinese meteorological balloon and would increase patrols at military facilities.\nTaiwan's defence ministry revealed on February 14 that Chinese balloons have previously flown over the island, without providing details on the number or frequency.\nAt that time, the ministry said it would shoot down any targets that pose a \"high level of threat\", but added that it had not encountered any such threats.\nBeijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure in recent years on Taiwan, which China has vowed to seize one day, by force if necessary.",

          "description": "Brazilian Amazon deforestation reached its worst-ever February level in the second month of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential term, provisional data showed Friday.\nSurveillance satellites had detected 209 square kilometers (80.6 square miles) of forest destroyed,, according to the INPE space research institute's DETER monitoring system.\nThis is an area equivalent to about 30,000 football fields.\nThe INPE report included data only up to February 17, but was already an increase from the previous worst February, in 2022, when far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro was still in office.\nLast month, Amazon deforestation was down 61 percent from a year earlier, according to the same source.\nBut experts warned at the time it was premature to talk of a \"reversal\" of the deforestation trend, partly because some forest loss may have been unobserved due to heavy cloud cover.\nThe February increase may partly reflect forest losses that were unobserved in January, WWF Brazil expert Daniel Silva told AFP.\nOver Bolsonaro's presidency, average annual deforestation increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade.\nBolsonaro instigated policies that favored the agriculture and logging industries mostly responsible for deforestation.\nHaving previously governed Brazil from 2003-10, Lula took office on January 1 this year with a promise to rebuild the government agencies tasked with protecting the environment after severe budget and personnel cuts inflicted on them by Bolsonaro.\nHe has also announced an ambitious goal of zero deforestation by 2030.\nIn order to do so he is counting on international aid, notably through the Amazon Fund, to which Germany and Norway are the main contributors.\n© 2023 AFP",

Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 2001 hijacked plane attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people.\nIt came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. \"war on terror\" because of harsh interrogation methods that critics have said amounted to torture.\nThere were 40 detainees when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021. Biden has said he hopes to close the facility. The federal government is barred by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. mainland prisons.\nOn Thursday, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Abdul Rabbani and Mohammed Rabbani to Pakistan.\nBoth were arrested in 2002. Abdul Rabbani was an al Qaeda facilitator while Mohammed Rabbani was a financial and travel facilitator for prominent al Qaeda leaders, according to the Pentagon's website.\n\"The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.\nA total of 32 detainees remain, of whom 18 are eligible for transfer, the Pentagon said in its statement.\n(Reporting by Costas Pitas in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler))",

Ricardo Rubio/EUROPA PRESS/dpa\nThe legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is the focus of this year's ARCO 2023, the contemporary art fair held in Madrid, a half-century after his death.\nThe 42nd ARCO was opened on Thursday by the King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.\nA hyper-realistic replica of Picasso's \"corpse,\" wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt typical of the artist and laid out on a kind of tombstone, is the star exhibit.\nSpanish artist Eugenio Merino's sensational sculpture, entitled \"Aquí murió Picasso\" (Here Picasso died), is a denunciation of the exploitation of the figure of the artist for commercial and tourist purposes, especially in Picasso's native city of Málaga.\nLong queues of onlookers quickly formed in front of the work, which is on the market for €45,000 ($47,600), according to the newspaper El País.\nMany visitors took photos and selfies. So far they are all invited guests - including politicians, art dealers, collectors and journalists - as the fair does not open to the general public until Friday. By Sunday, the organizers expect around 100,000 visitors.\nAlongside this sculpture, numerous works by Picasso himself, who together with the Frenchman Georges Braque is considered the founder of Cubism, are on display at the IFEMA exhibition centre in the Spanish capital.\nThere is no guest country at ARCO this year. The theme is \"The Mediterranean: A Round Sea.\"\nA total of 211 galleries from three dozen countries are taking part in ARCO 2023. After the host country Spain, Germany is the most strongly represented, with 29 galleries showing works.",

          "description": "A six-decade archive charting pop icon David Bowie's career will open in London in 2025, providing a \"new source book for the Bowies of tomorrow\", a museum director said Wednesday.\nDirector of the Victoria and Albert Museum Tristram Hunt said the \"incredible\" collection had more than 80,000 items of Bowie memorabilia.\nThey range from hand-written lyrics and letters to sheet music, original costumes, photography and album artwork.\nA number of instruments owned by Bowie as well as music videos, set designs and awards are also due to go on display.\nBowie, originally from south London, died in 2016 at the age of 69.\nThe collection will be housed at the Bowie Centre for the Study of Performing Arts, a new outpost of London's Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThe museum was delighted to be become \"custodians of his incredible archive, and to be able to open it up for the public\", said Hunt.\n\"Bowie's radical innovations across music, theatre, film, fashion, and style -– from Berlin to Tokyo to London – continue to influence design and visual culture and inspire creatives from Janelle Monae to Lady Gaga to Tilda Swinton and Raf Simons,\" he added.\nBowie enjoyed an extraordinary career generating around 140 million record sales and taking in styles from glam rock to jazz, as well as stage personas such as Ziggy Stardust.\nThe new centre will be located at the V&A East Storehouse venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London.\nThe museum said this had been made possible through a £10 million (around $12 million) joint donation by the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group.\nBowie's estate sold the publishing rights to his \"entire body of work\" to Warner last year.\nThe centre meant his life's work was now taking its \"rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses\", said a spokesperson from the David Bowie Estate.\nThe behind-the-scenes access the new venue offers \"will mean David's work can be shared with the public in ways that haven't been possible before\".\n© 2023 AFP",

It has left open the possibility that it could still be building Super Hornets two years after that for an unspecified \"international customer,\" which is very likely a reference to a potential Indian Navy contract.

Thanks, Joe. \nAt the time of the announcement, Biden claimed that it was Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who recommended the move. However, just a week prior, both Austin and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley expressed opposition to sending tanks to Ukraine because it would take too long to train the Ukraine military how to use them, and they had plenty of tanks already at their disposal, including captured Russian tanks. So, naturally, I have my doubts.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This is a debate that Americans should gave. But they are not .... Shhh!
