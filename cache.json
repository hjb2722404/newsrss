          "description": "Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.\nJust days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.\nHe ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was \"convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors.\"\nIn a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil's presidents live.\nLeftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.\nAs he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.\n>> Read more: Brazil riots raise questions of efficiency and loyalty of security forces\nThe president said last week that any \"radical bolsonarista\" found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.\n\"How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?\" asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.\nBolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula's inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.\nHe has denied any link to the riots.\nIn a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed \"regret\" over the events, which he described as \"unbelievable\".\n(AFP)",

An insane number of Ukrainian brigades, though many partially depleted, were concentrated on that 50 kilometer long front. This left other sectors nearly empty of Ukrainian troops.       \nI count the equivalent of some 27 brigade size formations in that area. The usual size of a brigade is some 3,000 to 4,000 men with hundreds of all kinds of vehicles. If all brigades had their full strength that force would count as 97,500 men. In a recent interview the Ukrainian military commander Zaluzhny said that his army has 200,000 men trained to fight with 500,000 more having other functions or currently being trained. The forces which are currently getting mauled in the Bakhmut area constitute 50% of Ukraine's battle ready forces. \nOn the southern and northern sectors of the battle-line the Ukrainian forces have been thinned out and are only able to defend against minor forces.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: Fighting on Ukraine southern front 'sharply' increases (AFP).   \nWNU Editor: I expect Ukraine will be launching a counter offensive in the next day or two.

All Western eyes, that is.  And understandably so. The consequences of the Russian invasion have been huge, not least when it comes to energy prices. \nIf the West is preoccupied, however, that doesn’t mean the rest of the world has ground to a halt. \nLife hasn’t stopped just because NATO and Moscow are locked in conflict.  Other countries have their own problems to face – pressing ones. And it should be no surprise that a range of middle-ranking powers, including India, Turkey and South Africa have refused to take sides. \nThe vicious civil war in the Yemen, the fighting in the Horn of Africa, the perpetual conflicts in the Middle East – all these are continuing, even if the Western media has turned its gaze elsewhere. \nThese battles will not remain frozen just because America is preoccupied. And it is a mistake to ignore them because the various outcomes will help shape the future for all of us.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: A list of ongoing armed conflicts that are taking place around the world is here (link here).",

Putin’s failure to split the NATO allies after nearly a year of war. But small yet significant fractures are getting too big to hide. \nThe differences are over strategy for the coming year and the more immediate question of what Ukraine needs in the next few months, as both sides in the war prepare for major offensives in the spring.
