Greater stability. Greater connection,” Biden said upon arriving in Israel on Wednesday. “A two-state solution. That remains, in my view, the best way to ensure the future of equal measure of freedom, prosperity, and democracy for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”\nBut the reality in 2022 d…",

Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.\nRiver catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.\n\"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,\" Sullivan said.\nMore than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.\nA La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",

Another of his discoveries, Bobby Castillo, a converted third baseman known as Babo, taught Valenzuela how to throw a screwball.\n“I’m not lying to you,” Brito told the Los Angeles Times in 2011. “Within a week, Fernando was throwing the ball as well as Babo.”\n“For many, many Mexican prospects, he was a God,” Jaime Jarrina Spanish-language Dodgers broadcaster since 1959, told Baseball America last year.  “They loved him because he protected them.”\nMike Brito was born on August 21, 1934 in Cuba.  As a catcher, beginning in 1955, he played three seasons in the lower tiers of the Washington Senators minor league system and then several seasons in the Mexican League.\nAfter retiring, he moved to Los Angeles, where he found work as a truck driver and started an adult amateur league in which he also played.\nScouting became his way of staying in baseball.  “Thank God I became a scout in the Mexican League,” he said in a short video profile, “The White Hat and the Wild Horse: The Scout Who Found Puig.” When Dodgers general manager Al Campanis asked him to work for the team, he recalled thinking, “It’s like finding a guy in the desert and asking him if he wants a drink. of water.\n\nSource Link",

First Class James Pulliam, dressed head to toe in camouflage, scanned a strip-mall parking lot for targets. \nHe spotted a young woman getting out of a car, and put on his best salesman smile. \n“Hey, how’d you know I was going to be here today!” the sergeant said with an affable Carolina drawl, as if greeting an old friend. “I’m going to help put you in the Army!” \nThese are tough times for military recruiting. Almost across the board, the armed forces are experiencing large shortfalls in enlistments this year — a deficit of thousands of entry-level troops that is on pace to be worse than any since just after the Vietnam War.

          "description": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz   \nThe UnHeard: The German economy is on the brink  \nPutin can't be blamed for the country's economic malaise \nThe economist Herbert Stein once wrote that if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. It seems like the German — and with it probably the European — economy is reaching that point. Most of Europe’s 100 largest companies were founded in the 1980s or before, which means that the old continent has entirely slept through the digital revolution of the 1990s and 2000s. There is no European counterpart to American corporations like Facebook, Amazon, E-Bay or China’s Alibaba or WeChat. \nThis became painfully clear during the Covid pandemic, when the once vaunted German bureaucracy was revealed to rely on paper, pens and fax machines in its health care system due to a complete lack of digitalisation in key areas. Not surprisingly, the German economy shows cracks elsewhere as well. Measured by market capitalisation, only one German company makes it into the top 100 worldwide, and German market capitalisation as a share of global market capitalisation has shrunk to 1.97%, an all-time low. These are devastating numbers for a country that just a few years back was seen as a model for the world with its transition to Green energy and the planned exodus from nuclear power.   \nRead more ....\nUpdate: Germany: Unprepared for a perfect storm (ING) \n Update #2: \"Social Peace Is In Great Danger\": Germany Is Quietly Shutting Down As Energy Crunch Paralyzes Economy (Zero Hedge)   \nWNU Editor: Germany's economic malaise/problems were present long before the Russia - Ukraine war. It is just that with the energy crisis not engulfing Europe because of Russian sanctions and other disastrous EU decisions, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the German and EU economies are now being exposed. The end result of this crisis is predictable. We will not only see the de-industrializing of Germany, but a lower standard of living for most if not all of Europe.",
