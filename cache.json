But ideally, they will also do more by providing insights and practical tips on everything from study techniques and essay writing to exam strategies, time management and independent learning skills in order for students to achieve the best possible results.¬†\r \r \r \r ‚ÄúOur courses give students a stronger academic foundation and help them develop the skills they need to succeed in higher education and beyond,‚Äù says Mr T. K. Eric Ng, Founder of NTK Academic Group, which has been operating in Hong Kong for almost 28 years. ‚ÄúWe can create individualised learning plans based on each student‚Äôs academic needs and targets. These plans outline specific goals to work towards and progress is regularly assessed.‚Äù¬†\r \r NTK‚Äôs teachers, many of whom have advanced degrees from renowned universities like Oxford, Cambridge and the Ivy League, are among the best in their fields. This ensures that students receive high-quality instruction and support from a knowledgeable and experienced team.\r \r A wide range of subjects is on offer, not just for the IBDP curriculum, but also for the IGCSE, GCE A-Levels and the standardised university admissions tests often required of candidates applying from international schools and boarding schools.¬†\r \r As a result, NTK has helped more than 80 students achieve full scores (a total of 45 marks) in the IBDP over the past three years, with a further 200 getting a 7 in various subjects.¬†\r \r \r \r ‚ÄúWhether for group courses using proprietary materials developed by IBDP‚Ä¶",
