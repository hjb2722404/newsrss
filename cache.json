          "description": "The British government on Friday approved the construction of a controversial road tunnel near the historic Stonehenge site in southwestern England.\nThe decision comes two years after campaigners won a legal battle to throw out permission for the project that would include digging a new two-mile (3.3 kilometer) tunnel running past the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) project is intended to ease congestion on an existing main road to southwest England that gets especially busy during the peak holiday periods.\nIt was initially authorized in 2020 by Grant Shapps, the transport minister at the time, despite a panel of planning experts warning of \"permanent, irreversible harm\" to the area.\nThe following year the decision was successfully challenged in the High Court.\nBut the court stressed that its ruling was not on the merits of the scheme, but on the legality of the minister's granting of approval.\nIn a 64-page letter granting fresh approval, Shapps' successor Mark Harper said he was \"satisfied\" that the project's \"harm on spatial, visual relations and settings is less than substantial and should be weighed against the public benefits\".\nOpponents of the plan have warned against the massive engineering project in an area full of archaeological treasures around the standing stones, while UNESCO said the site could lose its World Heritage Site status if construction goes ahead.\nSteve Gooding, head of the RAC motoring group, indicated that opponents of the project will likely mount another legal challenge.\n\"This saga is starting to feel almost as old as the stones themselves and it's not over yet,\" Gooding said.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "The Fulton County Jail in Atlanta is now the target of a federal civil rights investigation after it was reported that unsanitary conditions on the jail contributed to the death of a inmate who was suffering from insect infestation, The Washington Post reported. \nLashawn Thompson, 35, was pronounced dead in his jail cell last September. An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.\nHis attorney said that he had been \"eaten alive.\"\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates \"do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.\" \n“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,\" she said. \nClarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a \"racial justice issue,\" citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail. \nRead the full report at The Washington Post.",

The injury is known as a bilateral atlanto occipital joint dislocation. \nWhen the child arrived in the trauma unit, doctors said his head was \"almost completely detached from the base of his neck.\" The following procedure took several hours and required the doctors to use \"new plates and fixations in the damaged area.\" \n\"Our ability to save the child was thanks to our knowledge and the most innovative technology in the operating room,\" Dr. Ohad Einav, said. \nHassan has been released from the hospital in Israel with a cervical splint. Doctors will continue to monitor him. \n\"The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process is no small thing,\" Einav said.",

And unless he changes his mind in the coming months (which I doubt), or that he experiences a health emergency that will force him to leave the primary race (which is possible), he will be the Democrat Presidential candidate in 2024.",
