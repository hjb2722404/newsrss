The trial was previously held in the high-security Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, but the Islamabad High Court ruled against it. The special court in Islamabad approved Khan's jail trial in an open-court format at the next hearing. Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi have pleaded not guilty to the charges in the cipher case.",

The bookÂ is set in a dystopian Dublin in the grips of totalitarianism. Some of the themes of \"Prophet Song\" are eerily similar to the riots that broke out in Dublin last week. \"Prophet Song\" also echoes the violence in Palestine, Ukraine and Syria, and the experience of all those who flee from war-torn countries. The author speaks to FRANCE 24's culture editor Eve Jackson about winning the most prestigious literature prize in the English-speaking world, writing the Irish offspring of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"Â â and what he's spending his prize money on.",

The agreement marks the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since Hamasâs bloody cross-border October 7 attack on southern Israel that prompted Israel to launch a bombing campaign and ground offensive in Hamas-ruled Gaza.\nIsraelâs government and Hamas agreed to a four-day pause in fighting to allow the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave.\nThe deal, which was brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US, came after five weeks of negotiations, according to a US official.\nUS President Joe Biden said late Tuesday he was deeply relieved that some hostages taken when Hamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7 will soon go free.\nQatar on Wednesday provided more details on the deal.",

William Walldorf, Jr., Real Clear Wire: Time to Drawdown From SyriaÂ \nAs part of the fallout from the war in Gaza, U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq have come under attack more than fifty times from Iranian-backed militias since early October.  At least fifty-six military personnel have been injured. In response, the U.S. launched retaliatory air strikes and has sent about 900 more troops to the region.Â \nThis bolstering of forces is the wrong move. In fact, the U.S. is overdue to drawdown its forces from Syria.Â \nWhy drawdown completely?  The answer is simple.  The small contingent of U.S. forces in Syria, especially, are sitting ducks for further attacks in support of missions where the costs of continuing those missions now far outstrip their strategic benefits.  Recent attacks bring this mismatch between costs and benefits into sharp relief.  These incidents should also serve as a warning for potential dangers if U.S. policy fails to change course.\n\nÂ \nRead more ....\n\nÂ \nWNU Editor: The U.S. is not going to withdraw any of its forces from Syria.
