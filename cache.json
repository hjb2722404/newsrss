The revised terms of the contract were previously reported by Bloomberg.\n\t\n\n\t\tPfizer said it had already delivered 400 million vaccine doses in 79 countries under the U.S. government contract.\n\t\n\n\t\tThe vaccine doses were donated through the COVAX program, run by the World Health Organization and GAVI global vaccine alliance, which was intended to deliver COVID-19 shots to the world's poorer countries.\n\t\n\n\t\tThe program initially struggled to acquire enough vaccine to fulfill its mission, but improved output from manufacturers has led to a glut of doses in 2022.\n\t\n\n\t\tCOVAX has been negotiating since June with vaccine manufacturers to cut or slow deliveries of 400 million to 600 million vaccine doses from its own contracts.\n\t\n\n\t\t(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

He predicted the voting regions \"will integrate into Russia\".\n\t\n\n\t\tFor most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.\n\t\n\n\t\tThe referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.\n\t\n\n\t\tElection officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.",

Only about half of the planned 550 seats will open this fall, with the rest to follow early next year. \nThe New England-style seafood spot will seek a new home on the Upper West Side, the owners said.James Keivom\n“We haven’t built it yet,” Abrams explained.\nThis will be their fifth and biggest mermaid.
