          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r Imagine applying to 25 of the world’s top universities and getting accepted into all of them. Jamie Beaton did exactly that and that isn’t even the most impressive thing about him. \r \r Beaton graduated from Harvard University in 2016 with a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree two years ahead of schedule. At just 20 years old, he became one of the youngest admits to Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB), arguably the world’s top MBA school. In 2022, he completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford on the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.\r \r But his success story is not just about impressive credentials — he uses his own experience to support other students to reach for the stars as he did. At just 17, Jamie co-founded Crimson Education, now the world's largest and most effective college admissions consulting firm which has supported over 20,000 students to gain offers to the most competitive universities. In Hong Kong alone, Crimson has helped more than 200 students to secure coveted offers from Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Princeton and so on.\r \r Beaton’s success didn’t happen overnight. His journey began in his teenage years, when he fearlessly charged ahead in his interests and academic pursuits.\r \r  \r \r The Making of a Prodigy: Jamie’s Teenage Years\r \r Beaton was no different from the average New Zealand teenager who loved playing video games and going to amusement parks. He had his secondary education at King's College, New Zealand, and planned to study medicine at his home university, the University of Auckland. Everything changed at 15 when he had a chat with a senior, who suggested that Beaton explore options outside Auckland. That’s when he started to shift his focus and set his sights on the Ivy League, Oxbridge, and other top international universities.\r \r Beaton took 10 A-Levels instead of the usual three. With a stellar academic and extracurricular profile, he received offers from all 25 top universities he applied to,…",

Joni Ernst (R-IA), outlined her rationale for backing Ukraine in its war by saying failing to do so could potentially lead to a \"bigger war\" in the future.\nThe man angrily shouted that he was \"done\" with Republicans and said he could not support a pro-war party.\nAccording to CBS News reporter Musadiq Bidar, the man also claimed that Ukraine was not an ally of the United States.\nREAD MORE: The View's audience bursts out laughing as Trump's words come back to haunt him\nThe issue of whether to continue supplying military aid to Ukraine has become a contentious one within the 2024 Republican Party primary.\nTraditional Republican hawks such as Haley have said that helping the Ukrainians repel the Russian invasion is the right strategic course, while \"America First\" Republicans such as former President Donald Trump have suggested forcing Ukraine to cut a deal with Russia to ensure peace, even if that deal means Ukraine gives up some of its own territory.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to straddle both sides of the debate, on one hand saying that appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown to be ineffective while at the same time accusing President Joe Biden of funding Ukraine to the detriment of other national security threats.",

The 15-year-old will instead become the new Earl of Wessex.\nEdward's wife Sophie who was particularly close to Elizabeth, who died last September, will now be known as the Duchess of Edinburgh.\nThe new duke and duchess will be in Edinburgh later on Friday at a reception to mark the first year of the conflict in Ukraine.\nThe dukedom was created for Prince Philip in 1947 after his marriage to the then Princess Elizabeth.\nPhilip, who died in April 2021, had favored Edward inheriting his title, but the decision ultimately had to be made by Charles as King.\nEarlier this week Buckingham Palace also updated its website's list of succession in relation to the two children of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan.\nThe children are now listed as Prince Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Princess Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor.\nAlthough they automatically became a prince and princess when Harry's father King Charles acceded to the throne last year, they had remained listed as plain \"master\" and \"miss\" on the website.\nThe titles had emerged as a contentious issue after Harry and Meghan quit royal life and moved to California in 2020.\n© 2023 AFP",

Araki and Weng had an unwritten agreement where Weng payed Araki $600 on a month-to-month basis. \nOn September 21, 2021, Araki allowed Weng’s friend, identified in the Hive's report as \"SJC,\" to stay in her rented bedroom. Weng then increased her rent payments from $600 to $700. Weng then took a trip to Taiwan, and SJC then signed a document post-dated May 24, allowing SJS to stay in Weng’s room to “safeguard her possessions.”\nIN OTHER NEWS: Backfire alert: GOP's anti-'wokeness' crusade could end up undermining their own candidates\nWhen Weng's return date was pushed back to 4 months later, Araki gave Weng until May 31 to move out -- even though Araki didn't initially signal any objections to the extended return date. \nAraki said Weng had “breached their contract by subleasing her room to SJC without his consent.” The court said that this contradicted Araki’s statement allowing SJC to move in.\n\"In the end, Araki was ordered to pay $40 to Weng for a partial rent refund and $130 in damages for $170,\" the Hive's report stated.",

I could have negotiated. At worst, I could've made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could've worked a deal.\"\nBut as Baragona pointed out, that is not what Hannity played.\n\"Instead, shortly after Trump says, 'I could have negotiated,' the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that 'China no longer respects the United States,'\" Baragona observed.\nBaragona also noted that \"besides asserting that he would have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine by making a deal to let them 'take over something,' Trump also said in the portion not aired by Fox that 'so many more people are dying than is being reported' while reiterating this 'would have never happened' under his watch.\"",

The website offers you access to original articles, fascinating podcasts with insightful guests, virtual and in-person events, and other resources to help illuminate this complex form of conflict. All IWI content is generated by members from the IW community — like you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDemand for IWI content has only increased over the past three years since our first podcast released. The new website is one part of a plan to grow IWI as a platform to meet this increased demand and to continue providing valuable resources to the IW professional community. We hope you enjoy the new website, and encourage you to continue helping us build this community. There are many ways to support: submitting an article, joining the team as a volunteer, planning an event in partnership with IWI, donating (even small contributions help!) or making a purchase from the IWI store, or simply continuing to follow IWI content and sharing it with other irregular warfare professionals in your network. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn behalf of the more than 50 volunteers who have worked incredibly hard to make this new website and the content it supports possible, we thank you for your continued support and engagement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Doug Livermore & Charles Faint\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n      Dave Maxwell\nSat, 03/11/2023 - 9:21am\n\nRead more about Irregular Warfare Initiative Launches New Website\nLog in or register to post comments",

          "description": "Washington Post: Mexico’s president rebukes GOP push to use U.S. military against cartels \nMexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pushed back Thursday against Republican lawmakers who have urged the Biden administration to take military action against the country’s drug cartels across the border after the abduction of four Americans in the border city of Matamoros. He said such demands threatened Mexican sovereignty. \n“We are not going to allow any foreign government to intervene and much less foreign armed forces to intervene in our territory,” López Obrador said at a news conference, adding that he would ask Americans of Mexican and Hispanic origin not to vote for Republicans if their “aggression” continued. \nLópez Obrador also sought to deflect attention from Mexico’s role in the fentanyl epidemic. He claimed his country does not produce the substance, which is responsible for the majority of U.S. drug overdose deaths, and cast its abuse as an American problem. U.S. law enforcement officials have said fentanyl is mass-produced by Mexican drug cartels and then distributed by American criminal networks.    \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: Rep.

The idea is to use an air-to-air missile with a nose that bends to get at the target before it can get away. The service views this as one path to giving current and future combat aircraft, including a sixth-generation stealth jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance program, a new way to engage increasingly maneuverable threats. \nThe Air Force Research Laboratory highlighted what is formally known as the Missile Utility Transformation via Articulated Nose Technology (MUTANT) project at this week's 2023 Air and Space Forces Association's Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado.
