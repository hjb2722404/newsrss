          "description": "A group of Iranian students, incensed at rules imposed on June 12 requiring female students to wear a maqna’a – a conservative Islamic headscarf in black that covers the head, neck and shoulders – began a sit-in in protest. They also wrote an open letter to the university administration, which said: “We have nothing to say to you except ‘no'.” A number of students were beaten and arrested for taking part in the protest, while also being threatened with suspension and even death. Thousands of people have posted “no” on their social media accounts in solidarity and students at dozens of other universities have published open letters in support of the Tehran art students.",

          "description": "The Kremlin said Thursday that footage, which could not be verified, apparently showing President Vladimir Putin greeting adoring supporters proved that he has \"astounding\" support after quelling an armed insurrection.\nMoscow has insisted that Putin's long rule has not been weakened after Wagner mercenaries marched hundreds of kilometers -- almost reaching Moscow -- and captured military facilities in southern Russia, appearing to gain some support.\nPutin is rarely seen meeting ordinary Russians, especially since the Covid pandemic, which saw him observe strict isolation rules, with some of those restrictions still in place.\nMoscow late on Wednesday released footage of Putin walking up to a cheering group of mostly women in Derbent, an ancient city in the Dagestan region of southern Russia.\n\"In Derbent, there was an astounding demonstration of support and happiness of the local population,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.\nHe said Putin \"could not refuse\" greeting the crowd.\nSurrounded by men in suits and a cameraman, the 70-year-old leader reached out over a barrier to shake people's hands.\nThen, with his jacket off, he waved goodbye and blew a kiss to the crowd, before getting in a car.\nThe Kremlin, which has not mentioned Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin by name since his mutiny, has insisted that Putin has not been weakened by the rebellion.\n\"The data we have show the prevailing and dominating support of the president and the special military operation,\" Peskov said Thursday using Moscow's official term for the conflict in Ukraine.\nPutin has insisted that the mutineers did not galvanize support during their rebellion.\nHe initially condemned the rebelling Wagner fighters as traitors and vowed tough punishment but after the mutiny was halted, Putin allowed the fighters to go back to their homes, join the regular army or go into exile in Belarus.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Cats are considered lucky in Japan, and owners of the popular pets spend big on their care. But how do you know when they're feline down?\nA tech firm and university in Tokyo have teamed up to produce an app trained on thousands of cat photos that they say can tell you when puss is in pain.\nSince its release last month, \"Cat Pain Detector\" has racked up 43,000 users, mostly in Japan but also in Europe and South America, said Go Sakioka, head of developer Carelogy.\nThe app is part of a growing array of tech for pet owners concerned for their furry friends' wellbeing, including similar mood and pain trackers made in Canada and Israel.\nCarelogy teamed up with Nihon University's College of Bioresource Sciences to gather 6,000 cat photos, in which they carefully studied the positions of the animals' ears, noses, whiskers and eyelids.\nThey then used a scoring system designed by the University of Montreal to measure minute differences between healthy cats and those suffering pain due to hard-to-spot illnesses.\nNext, the app developers fed the information into an AI detection system, which has further refined its skills thanks to around 600,000 photos uploaded by users, Sakioka said.\nNow the app \"has an accuracy level of more than 90 percent\", he told AFP.\nAccording to the Japan Pet Food Association, 60 percent of owners take their cat to a veterinarian at most once a year.\n\"We want to help cat owners judge more easily at home whether to see a vet or not,\" Sakioka said.\n\"Cat Pain Detector\" is already being used by some vets in Japan, the land of Hello Kitty, where tourists flock to cat cafes and some small islands are overrun by stray felines.\nBut \"the AI system still needs to be more precise before it's used as a standardIzed tool\", he cautioned.",

Baisotti has published a research paper on Chinese influence operations in Latin America. The paper, \"China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\" was published by the Florida International University's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy,\nAbstract: This paper analyzes the expansion of Chinese media and public diplomacy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Through its “discourse of power” and an attempt to extend its soft power across the continent, Chinese and some LAC media (print, audiovisual, and digital) sustained, amplified, and exalted the “achievements” of the Communist regime and the possibility of sharing them as a “community of common destiny” for all the world’s peoples. China strives to promote a positive image through communication and propaganda campaigns, incorporating LAC journalists, academics, politicians, and others who can improve its image as a reliable and supportive partner of the “Global South.”\nSource:  Pablo Baisotti, \"China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\" (2023). Research Publications. 55, https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/jgi_research/55.\nZFTWARNING\nTue, 06/27/2023 - 9:05pm\n\nRead more about China's Charm Offensive in Latin America and the Caribbean: A comprehensive Analysis of China's Strategic Communication Strategy Across the Region [Part I: Propaganda and Politics]\nLog in or register to post comments",

Charles Q. Brown Jr. of embracing race-based hiring and promotions in the military for the sake of \"diversity.\" \nThe American Accountability Foundation (AAF), an opposition research group that has claimed credit for dismantling several Biden nominations, is now targeting Brown, who is the president's nominee to serve as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At issue for the group are various public statements Brown has made in which he offered full-throated support for the military's diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. \nBrown, the first Black man to lead any branch of the U.S. military, has been outspoken in his belief that the military should be proactive in elevating diverse candidates to key positions. His previous public statements that articulated his views provide ample ammunition for critics like AAF and Republican opponents of DEI policies to attack his nomination.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: I  expect this will all come out during the confirmation hearings.
