          "description": "For several months, tensions have been rising in the West Bank. Following a wave of anti-Israeli attacks that killed 19 people in the spring, the Israeli government launched a vast military operation in the area. More than 2,000 people have been arrested and 130 Palestinians killed in raids and clashes, the heaviest toll since the Second Intifada. Operations have been concentrated in the northern West Bank, where more and more young people are joining new armed groups. These groups are popular, have a strong social media following and refuse to accept any political affiliation. The city of Nablus finds itself at their epicentre. FRANCE 24's Gwendoline Debono went to meet some of the young Palestinians who are returning to armed struggle.",

Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing.

Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.\n© 2022 AFP",
