This is the road that is used to feed the war with ammunition. And it militarizes the Crimean Peninsula. This is an enemy facility built outside international law, so understandably, it is a [military] objective,\" President Zelensky stated. \"And any target that is bringing war must be neutralized.\"¬†\nThe President also emphasized that the counteroffensive is progressing more slowly than expected because the operation started later than originally planned.
