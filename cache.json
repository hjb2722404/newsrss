My comment on the fact that 70% of those in police custody are on remand was raised because of concern about their specific lack of legal guarantee to education and treatment services and noting that I will guarantee that access when I’m sheriff. \nMy comment about seeking to hire more women in corrections echoed comments also made by the other two candidates, but was attributed to me only.  Still, I stand by the comment: Hiring more women in corrections will improve the culture and climate for everyone, and the research backs that up.  Women think differently about the use of force, doing it rarely but very effectively. \nWe need to change the field of corrections and start changing the makeup of those who work in it is a step in the right direction.  Not only do we need more women in corrections, but we need more bilingual staff and people who reflect non-dominant cultures, who are disproportionately represented in custody. \nI am committed to these goals and would welcome Ms Miller-Mack’s participation on my Citizens’ Advisory Council to bring transparency and accountability to the Hampshire Sheriff’s Office when elected.\n    Yvonne Gittelson\ncandidate for \nHampshire County Sheriff\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {   var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];   if (d.getElementById(id)) return;   js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;   js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=833431040023870\";   fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nSource link",

The judge who issued the warrant for Mar-a-Lago has signaled that he is likely to release a redacted version of the supporting affidavit.  But the warrant itself suggests the answer is probably no – the FBI had no legal cause for the raid.\nThe warrant authorized the FBI to seize “all physical documents and records constituting evidence, contraband, proceeds of crime, or other illegally possessed in violation of 18 USC §§793, 2071, or 1519” (emphasis added).  These three criminal statutes all deal with the possession and handling of documents containing national security information, public records, or documents relevant to an investigation or other matters before a federal agency or the courts. \n\nSource link",

          "description": "According to local media 36kr.com, Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent recently received a new patent for a blockchain-based missing persons poster.  The patent took nearly three years to issue from the date of its first submission in December 2019.\nThe paten consists of a request to generate data when the user submits that a person has disappeared.  The proposal is then unveiled publicly on the blockchain for verification.  Once a consensus has been reached regarding the request, it is then stored in the public ledger and transmitted to the nodes for dissemination to a wider audience.  Tencent said in the patent application that the design aims to improve the efficiency of finding missing persons.\nTencent was an early adopter of blockchain technology among big tech companies, particularly when it came to exploring possibilities for integration with payment technology;  though his efforts have been hampered somewhat by China’s strict crypto regulations.  Yet his “FISCO BCOS” coinless blockchain jointly developed with Chinese telecom giant Huawei from 2018 for building decentralized applications remains active to this day. \nEarly July, Tencent close one of its non-fungible token platforms after the Chinese government clarified that it does not allow users to conduct private transactions after purchase, as well as a drop in sales.\nChina is currently embarking on a centralized approach to blockchain technology, with a policy significantly favoring its central bank digital currency in digital yuan (e-CNY) instead of digital tokens developed by private companies.  Last week, the country rolled out its first-ever e-CNY-enabled social security card, which allows social assistance to be directly deposited into the recipient’s digital yuan account and used for expenses. \n\n\nSource Link",

The ruble’s initial nosedive in value quickly reversed after the state limited currency transactions and after Russia’s imports plummeted — an economic picture that can hardly be described as healthy, but one that calmed public fears about a currency crisis.

That last point is crucial, since we have not, so far, seen any official renderings of the H-20 beyond depictions that are highly obscured, and which may not actually bear much of a relationship to the final design.
