The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

But he fell just short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff, in a race with profound consequences for Turkey itself and global geopolitics.\nHis unexpectedly strong showing amid a deep cost of living crisis, and a win in parliamentary elections for a coalition of his conservative Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP), the nationalist MHP and others, buoyed the vetera…",

In a lengthy Twitter missive shared on Friday evening, the 79-year-old rock star passionately defended his controversial wardrobe choices for his May 17 and May 18 performances in Berlin. His costume — complete with a long black jacket, gloves, and a red armband adorned with hammers, rather than the Nazi swastika — shocked fans and sparked outrage across the internet. “The elements ...",

          "description": "(Reuters) - Russia on Saturday blamed Kosovo, the United States and European Union for escalating tensions in the Balkans and said it was watching with concern after violent clashes between Kosovan police and protesters opposed to ethnic Albanian mayors.\nThe United States and allies on Friday rebuked Kosovo, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas undermined efforts to improve troubled relations with neighbouring Serbia. NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.\nThe clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.\n\"We decisively condemn Pristina's provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,\" Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.\n\"The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,\" she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by \"Western mediators\" had come too late.\nSerbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo's independence, and Moscow has blocked the country's bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.\n(Reporting by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Conor Humphries)",

In February, Google cut about one-third of a unit that aims to protect society from misinformation, radicalization, toxicity and censorship,\" says CNBC. \"Meta reportedly ended the contracts of about 200 content moderators in early January.

When we arrived at the range, a Ukrainian unit was already on the range throwing hand grenades in an open field less than 200 meters from us, then just dropping to the ground and watching them explode without any cover. These soldiers then proceeded to conduct machine gun training, shooting from positions from the left range berm across the range (not against the backstop).  Our instructors were conducting round-robin training about 150 meters behind the range, and the rounds were whistling over our heads. When we approached the person in charge, he said not to worry; he was a Ukrainian marine who had survived Mariupol, and the range was to NATO standards.

Image: Revierfoto/dpa/picture alliance\n\n \nDW: Germany's far-right AfD sees poll numbers surging \nPolls see Germany's center-left coalition government in free fall while the far-right populist AfD is reaping the benefits. It currently polls on par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats. \nNever before have voters in Germany been this unhappy with the current coalition government: Only one in five says they are doing a good job. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens, and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) are plummeting in the polls, after only one and a half years in office. \nThis is according to pollster infratest-dimap who surveyed 1300 eligible voters on May 30 and 31, 2023, and published the results in its monthly \"Deutschlandtrend.\" \nThe far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the main beneficiary. Its approval ratings have gone up by another 2% since May and, if elections were held now, would win 18% nationwide putting them on a par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD. In several eastern states, the AfD has long been the strongest party.  \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Centrists alarmed as poll shows growing support for German far-right party (AP)\n \nUpdate #2: German far right surges in polls, alarming mainstream parties (Euronews)\n\n \nWNU Editor: In my lifetime I have never seen a German government this incompetent AND dangerous. \nAfter only one and a half years in office, Germany has lost its source of stable and cheap energy. Its economy, once the envy of the world, is now in a recession. There is no leadership or direction from the Chancellor's office. And to top it all off, the country is now involved in a war against Russia.\nThe AfD may be a far-right populist party. But they, and other opposition parties, in the eys of many Germans are looking very good right now.",

Montreal’s commander, Capt. Paul Mountford, called the move unprofessional. The Chinese warship came within a 150 yards of the U.S. ship. \nMountford told Global News the incident was ”clearly instigated by the Chinese.”\n\n \nRead more .... \n Chinese Warship Comes Within 150 Yards Of The U.S. Destroyer In Taiwan Strait Transit\n\n \nChinese warship nearly hits U.S. destroyer in Taiwan Strait during joint Canada-U.S. mission -- Global News\n \nChinese warship almost hits US Navy ship in the Taiwan Strait -- Task & Purpose\n \nChinese warship comes within yards of US destroyer in latest act of aggression in Taiwan Strait: report -- FOX News",
