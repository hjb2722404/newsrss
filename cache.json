If that happens, it will take the benchmark rate to 4.4% by the end of the year, which is significantly higher than the June estimate of 3.8%.  The Fed has also hinted that it only expects rate cuts to be considered in 2024.\nThe expectation of higher rates pushed the 2-year Treasury note to 4.1%, its highest level since 2007. This could attract several investors seeking safety in this uncertain macro environment.

But after Putin's announcement early today that he had ordered a partial mobilization, all that I have been hearing from the leaders of NATO and countries that border Russia is nothing but rhetoric denouncing this move (see above video). \nNo calls to match Russia's partial mobilization. No calls to even declare a partial wartime industrial mobilization. Even Ukraine is silent on matching this Russian mobilization.\n\nYou can take this to the bank. \nIf the West does nothing in the coming days to say that they will match Russia's mobilization efforts, this is going to cause panic in Ukraine that the West is now abandoning them. And in the eyes of the Kremlin, another example on how weak and ineffective the West has become. \nMy prediction. \nThe West (primarily the U.S.) will announce more troop deployments to eastern Europe, and more aid to Ukraine in the coming days. But it will fall short from what Ukraine needs, and it will certainly not match what Russia is going to do.",

In terms of volume, China’s overall LNG imports from Russia increased by 28.5% year-on-year; for imports from Qatar, they increased by 66.7%, or two-thirds.  \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It is always about the money. \nChina's Traders Are Making A Killing Selling Russian Energy Products To Countries That Have Sanctioned Russian Energy Products   \nChina is benefitting from LNG sales to Europe as some traders resell non-Russian cargoes at high prices while restocking with cheap Russian fuel -- Insider  \nChina’s Energy Giants Sell Gas to World Scrambling for Supply -- Bloomberg  \nChina Is Quietly Reselling Its Excess Russian LNG To Europe -- OilPrice.com",
