It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.\nMelnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.\nRecently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.\nMelnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.\nThe Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of \"distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.\"\nMelnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. \"Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,\" Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations \"absurd.\"\nMelnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post.

Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.\nRiver catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.\n\"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,\" Sullivan said.\nMore than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.\nA La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",

          "description": "Jewelry and gems worth millions – a conservative figure puts the value at $10 million – were stolen from a Brink’s armored truck near Los Angeles last week, the security firm said, leaving some victims ask how such theft could have happened.\nThe merchandise was loaded onto a Brink’s truck at an event hosted by the International Gem and Jewelry Show on July 10 in San Mateo, near San Francisco, said Brandy Swanson, the group’s events director.  She said the truck was on its way to another exhibit 370 miles away at the Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena.\nBut in circumstances that have not been made public, the merchandise was taken from the truck near Los Angeles early Monday, said Brink’s spokeswoman Dana Callahan.\n\n\nThe value of the stolen merchandise, which included several gold and diamond necklaces, was not immediately clear.  It was also unclear how many pieces had been taken.\n\n\nOne of the jewelers, who requested anonymity for security reasons given the expensive jewelry he handles, estimated the total value of what was stolen at between $20 million and $50 million.  Ms. Callahan said it was less than $10 million.\n“Based on information customers provided to us prior to shipping their items, the total value of missing items is less than $10 million,” Brink’s said in a statement.  “We are working with law enforcement and will fully reimburse our customers for the value of their assets that were stolen, in accordance with the terms of our contract.”\nThe jeweler said Brink’s was not transparent with jewelry owners and many fundamental questions about the loss remained unanswered.\nNeither authorities nor Brink’s released details of what happened, including the location of the theft and whether anyone was injured.\n\n\nA spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency was working with local authorities but could not provide more information.  In its statement, Brink’s called the episode “a loss incident.”\n\nSource Link",

It was more listening to friends and family on what they are going through right now in Ukraine. \nSighhh ... it has been a draining day. But I should not complain. I am in Canada where I am safe. \nAs for the above video report. Kudos to Dima at the Military Summary YouTube channel spending his day trying to understand the military situation on the ground by compiling both Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministry briefings into something that is meaningful. No one has come close to doing what he is doing, including all those high-paid retired Generals giving their 5 minute analysis on TV that is proven wrong 2 weeks later. \nSome other interesting news that I picked up today. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has been making some remarks that is raising a few eyebrows. One .... he says he was misquoted when he said Ukraine will soon have a million soldiers. Reason being that his English is not good. He instead expects something like 700,000 soldiers. \nAnd two .... he has been quoted as saying that the Ukraine military has already suffered 100,000 casualties since the start of the war?!?!?!? I have been trying to find other Ukrainian media and government outlets to verify this casualty number, but no luck so far.\n\nRussian media is saying that they have already destroyed a number of US supplied HIMARS systems, and that the Russian military advance continues. I am always skeptical of these reports, but I have noticed a reduction in reports of long range artillery strikes by Ukraine in the past few days.",

          "description": "Space Review: Kalina: a Russian ground-based laser to dazzle imaging satellites \nThere is strong evidence that a space surveillance complex in Russia’s northern Caucasus is being outfitted with a new laser system called Kalina that will target optical systems of foreign imaging satellites flying over Russian territory. Initiated in 2011, the project has suffered numerous delays, but recent Google Earth imagery shows that construction is now well underway. Kalina will complement a mobile laser dazzler known as Peresvet that has been operational since late 2019. \n The Krona space surveillance complex Kalina is part of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Krona space surveillance complex, situated several kilometers west of Zelenchukskaya, a place well known in the astronomical community. Also located in its immediate vicinity are the Russian Academy of Science’s Special Astrophysical Observatory (housing the six-meter BTA telescope) and the RATAN-600 radio telescope.    \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Kalina: Russia's advanced laser system that can blind enemy satellites (WION)  \nUpdate #2: Russia Building Laser Weapon To 'Soft Kill' US Spy Satellites (Zero Hedge)   \nWNU Editor: Russia is not the only country building these space weapons ....
