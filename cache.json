The Anti-Defamation League recorded a 55% rise in antisemitic incidents in the US compared to the same period last year. There have also been spikes in anti-Israel rallies and antisemitic harassment on messaging apps. Similarly, the Council on American-Islamic Relations reported an increase in anti-Muslim incidents in the past week. In the UK, anti-Muslim attacks have increased sixfold, while France and Germany have also seen a rise in antisemitic incidents.",

When Hamas released two captives, the Raanan family, US officials thanked Qatar for their involvement. Families of the remaining hostages hope this is just the beginning. The hostages have likely been split into small groups, and it is unclear why the Raanans were released first, although their American nationality may have played a role.",

The study attributes the dramatic increase in temperatures to heightened volcanism and the sun emitting more energy and heat as it ages. The research provides insights into how Earth's climate might change in the distant future due to natural processes. Despite concerns about contemporary climate change, the Earth is expected to remain habitable until the emergence of Pangea Ultima.",

Erdoğan signed the accession protocol and forwarded it to the Grand National Assembly for ratification, Turkey's presidential office said on Monday. Approval is considered likely as Erdoğan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its partners hold a majority in parliament.
