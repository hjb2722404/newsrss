According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2020) and the International Labour Organisation (2020), 47.66% of women aged above 15 worldwide are competing in the job market. Facing competition for social resources, people should resort to competence, a highly valued trait in this context.¬†\r \r Unfortunately, women continuously experience marginalisation, while the benefits brought by physical attractiveness seem obvious especially for them. Competition may lead women to value their physical features over their inner qualities (including personalities, thoughts and feelings), a phenomenon known as self-objectification. Those who engage in self-objectification, perceive and treat themselves merely as objects to be evaluated based on looks.¬†\r \r In addition, this effect could be more robust among women who believe they can achieve a sense of control over others, especially men, through their sexuality‚Äîthe belief that sex is power.

Can they reflect political and social situations? If you believe that recipe books can only teach you how to cook, you may be underestimating some important sources that reflect our history.\r \r Numerous scholars have argued that recipe books can be regarded as a reflection of the history, culture, society and identity of a country or place. Research on recipe books for communal canteens is especially rare in the field of China‚Äôs history. Dr FAN Ka-wai, Associate Professor of CityU‚Äôs Department of Chinese and History, has conducted research to discuss three recipe books created for communal canteens published in 1959. He used recipe books as the historical material, supplemented with government documents, booklets published by local authorities, newspapers and memoirs, among others, to reveal the diet of the Chinese people during the Great Famine, thus broadening our understanding of the Chinese Communist Party leaders‚Äô thoughts and how they exercised control in the countryside.\r \r In early 1958, China initiated the ‚ÄúGreat Leap Forward‚Äù campaign. Although previous studies broadened our understanding of this campaign, there is still plenty of room for us to discover more valuable historical sources to provide a more comprehensive picture of this campaign and the ensuing famine. In 1958, the people‚Äôs communes were established as an administrative entity in rural China. One of the most important elements of the commune were the communal canteens, which were established to ensure that all the members within the commune obtained a fair share of economic growth while forbidding the preparation of food at home.\r \r By the end of October 1958, over 2.65 million communal canteens were established across the country, and 70-90% of villagers ate in communal dining halls. Since free meals were provided every day, it was difficult for the canteens to design and cook many different dishes‚Ä¶",

This is known as the uncertainty reduction process in interpersonal communication. In the contemporary media environment, what people publish about themselves on social network sites (SNSs) provides information seekers with plenty of knowledge about the person. Previous research, however, showed that the SNSs information did not help an information seeker reduce uncertainties or feel closer to a person as much as directly interacting with the person.\r \r To explain this, previous research proposed a distinction between interpersonal and personal knowledge. Personal knowledge refers to how a target person feels, thinks, and behaves in certain situations. Interpersonal knowledge, on the other hand, refers to how a target reacts to an information seeker in a unique fashion different from how the target responds to others. It is argued that interpersonal knowledge can only be gained from direct interactions and it is the kind of knowledge that ultimately makes up the essence of affinity and intimacy.\r \r To answer further inquiries about how the information¬†one can find about a target online contributes to an information seeker‚Äôs personal and interpersonal certainties about the target, Dr Nancy DAI Yue, Assistant Professor of CityU‚Äôs Department of Media and Communication, led a research project¬† to investigate how the information seeker‚Äôs interpersonal and personal certainties about a target person were influenced by (1) positive and negative information on SNSs about a target person, (2) the source of the information, and (3) an information seeker‚Äôs positivism bias in interpersonal interactions.

Online video-mediated communication has been further popularised by the COVID-19 pandemic which sees more recreational and educational content posted online to reach a global audience. Online video-sharing platforms provide a space for influencers or educators to interact with audiences from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, thus creating opportunities for intercultural communication through online videos. In particular, how cultural identities are conveyed through the multimodal affordances of online videos warrants further investigation.\r \r Multimodal resources play an important role in the creation of video-based materials. The multimodality of videos offers content creators an enlarged set of resources, in addition to the use of language, to make meaning, and to perform their cultural identities. The notion of interculturality emphasises the interconnectedness of different cultures and considers how participants use different resources available to them to perform their cultural identities.\r \r Dr Jenifer HO, Assistant Professor of CityU‚Äôs Department of English, investigated how a multilingual YouTube influencer and his co-presenter who have a transnational trajectory orchestrate their multilingual and multimodal repertoires to make aspects of their identities relevant or irrelevant in a strategic way, to perform their multiple cultural identities.¬†\r \r The study found that interculturality is made visible in online videos through influencers‚Äô performance of dynamic and flexible multilingual practices.

          "description": "France is to face severe public transport disruptions on Thursday, operators have warned, as workers join a nationwide strike against a widely unpopular pension reform plan.\nThe suggested changes, still to be debated in parliament, would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and increase contributions required for a full pension.\nThe industrial action across different sectors on Thursday will be the first time in 12 years -- since that age was increased from 60 to 62 -- that all of France's unions are united.\n\"It'll be a hellish Thursday,\" Transport Minister Clement Beaune told broadcaster France 2 on Tuesday, urging all those who could to work from home.\nParis public transport operator RATP warned services would be diminished, with three metro lines out of service, and ten others only operating partially.\nServices would continue as normal on just two automated lines, though they risked being overcrowded, it said.\nElsewhere in the country, national train operator SNCF said many high-speed trains would be out of action, with just one in five maintaining their journeys in some areas.\nMost slow trains between cities would be halted.\nUp to 70 percent of nursery and primary school teachers are also expected to refuse to work, the education ministry has said.\nOpinion polls show that around two-thirds of French people oppose raising the retirement age, a move that comes amid high inflation and with the country still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron's last attempt at pension reform in 2019, aborted a year later when Covid-19 hit Europe, prompted the longest strike on the Paris transport network in three decades.\nThe 45-year-old centrist put the issue at the heart of his successful re-election campaign last year, pointing to forecasts that the system would fall into heavy deficit at the end of the decade.\n¬© 2023 AFP",

At least 40 people were killed, including at least three children, Ukrainian authorities said as of noon on Monday.\nDozens more people remain missing in the rubble in sub-freezing weather.\nDespite Moscow's claims that it has only attacking military targets, Russian shells have repeatedly killed many civilians throughout the Russian invasion which was first launched in February of last year.\nPeskov, the Kremlin spokesman, placed blame for the \"tragedy\" over the weekend on Ukraine's air defences and contended that comments from Ukrainian officials themselves supported that claim.\nPeskov was apparently alluding to remarks by Oleksii Arestovych, an advisor in the Ukrainian presidential office, who said in a live online broadcast shortly after the attacks on Saturday that the missile \"was shot down and fell on the entrance to the building.\"\nArestovych, however, later said he was only speculating about a potential version of events that had not yet been investigated.\nThe Ukrainian Air Force has stated that it was in no position to intercept missiles of the type that struck the apartment block.\nPeskov on Monday also criticized Britain's announcement that it would provide Ukraine with 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks for its war effort.\n\"We take it very negatively,\" Peskov said of the British decision.",
