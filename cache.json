          "description": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in New Delhi arrested two people suspected of flouting fire safety regulations on Saturday after at least 27 people died in a blaze at a building housing a manufacturing unit for surveillance cameras.\nRescue teams worked overnight to clear the burnt out four-storey building near a railway station in the western suburbs.\nMore than 75 people were in the building when the fire broke out on Friday evening. Some jumped from windows to save themselves, according to eyewitnesses, and firefighters broke the glass and rescued people with ropes.\nAuthorities said fire started in an office on the first floor and spread rapidly. Two owners of the company were arrested as part of probe to identify suspected safety violations.\nOffering condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised 200,000 rupees ($2,580) in compensation for the victims' next-of-kin.\n(Reporting by Anushree Fadnavis; Writing by Nupur Anand; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",

Marcus Brandt/dpa\nUkrainian hopes of being able to repurpose frozen Russian assets to pay for war damage were dashed on Saturday as Germany's foreign minister highlighted the hurdles to such an approach.\nUkrainian officials have pushed for weeks for frozen Russian assets to be transferred to Kiev, to cover the costs of repairing destruction caused by Russia's invasion or even to pay for Ukraine's defence efforts.\nBut German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking at the end of a G7 foreign ministers' conference she hosted, said there were multiple problems with such an approach.\n\"Gaining access to frozen money is legally ... anything but easy,\" she said. She noted that there could be sound reasons to attempt such an act, but noted that they had to be aligned with the law.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had again proposed the idea at the session held on the Baltic coast.\n\"We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in Europe,\" he said, arguing that Russia should be forced to pay for the war, not only in political or economic terms, but also financially.\nBeyond legal issues, many European leaders fear attempts to liquidate and transfer Russian funds will lead to countries like Russia and China seeking to set up an alternative international financial system, which would make sanctions a weaker tool in the future.\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaks at the closing press conference of the G7 Foreign Ministers summit.

          "description": "Kouchner adds, “My grandmother killed herself soon after that.”\nIt’s the second funeral in the book — “a militant, heartbroken crowd who’d come to pay tribute to my grandmother’s freedom to kill herself.”  The suicide leaves Camille’s mother an alcoholic shell.  She drinks herself blind every night: “This is absolutely not up for discussion.  It’s my freedom.”\nThe book is a sharply focused portrait of a certain kind of privileged French family of its era, first revolutionary and then bourgeois: their sexual mores, their thirst for power and fame, the collateral damage to children.  The violation of her brother is explained, midbook, in one sentence: “He started stroking me, and then, you know …”\nFrom this point, the narrator’s voice ages as she comes to understand what this means, and the book takes on aspects of a psychological thriller.  The twins keep the secret for years.  At last, fearful for the safety of their own children, strangled by a “hydra” of guilt and shame, they confide in other members of their family, to decidedly mixed reaction.\nThe book finishes, effectively, in the most adult voice of all, that of the law.  Camille Kouchner addresses her stepfather directly, reciting the text of the French penal code on incest.  “Let’s be clear about this,” she writes:\n\nArticle 222—31—1 of the criminal code\nRape and sexual assaults are classified as incestuous when committed by:\n1) ascending year;\n2) a brother, a sister, an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, or a niece;\n3) or any other person, including a partner or family member, having legal or de facto control over the victim.\n\nClaire Berlinski is the editor in chief of The Cosmopolitan Globalist.  She lives in Paris.\n\nTHE FAMILY GRANDE, by Camille Kouchner |  Translated by Adriana Hunter |  214 p.  Other Press.  |  $24.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Cryptocurrency prices also fell precipitously.  The price of bitcoin fell to $26,000 on Thursday, down 60% from its peak in November, before rising somewhat.  Since the start of the year, Bitcoin’s price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq, a benchmark heavily weighted towards tech stocks, suggesting that investors are treating it like any other risky asset.\nEther’s price has also fallen, losing over 30% of its value over the past week.  Other cryptocurrencies, like Solana and Cardano, are also down.\nAny panic could be overdone, some analysts said.  A study by Mizuho showed that the average owner of Bitcoin on Coinbase would not lose money until the price of the digital currency fell below $21,000.  This, according to Mr. Dolev, is where a real death spiral could occur.\n“Bitcoin worked as long as nobody lost money,” he said.  “Once it gets back to those levels, it’s kind of an ‘Oh, my God’ moment.”\nProfessional investors who weathered the volatility in crypto also remained calm.  Hunter Horsley, managing director of Bitwise Asset Management, which provides crypto investment services to 1,000 financial advisers, met with more than 70 of them this week to discuss the market.  Many weren’t selling, he said, because all other assets were down as well.  Some were even trying to capitalize on the decline.\n“Their point of view is, ‘It’s not fun, but there’s nowhere to hide,'” he said.\nStill, the price crash has rattled crypto traders.  Just a few months ago, blockchain proponents predicted that Bitcoin’s price could hit $100,000 this year.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "“With privacy, it’s like once it’s out, it’s out,” Professor Meiklejohn said.\nDr. Rebecca Gomperts, a physician and director of Women on Waves, a nonprofit that provides resources for abortion seekers, found this to be the case when she tried to create her own crypto wallet.  “It had the exact same due diligence demands as a normal bank account, where you have to provide ID and other information,” she said.\nShe could see how anonymous transactions could attract abortion providers, whose work could soon turn them into legal targets.  But, she says, “I haven’t found any cryptocurrency where you can do that.”\nLawyers are not convinced that cryptocurrencies would protect patients in most cases.  Abortion bans “will cover everything whether you pay in cash or crypto,” said Rachel Rebouché, acting dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law and author of a forthcoming paper titled “The New Abortion Battleground.”\n“If abortion is illegal in your state — it doesn’t matter if you have a surgical abortion, a medical abortion, whether you self-manage your abortion — if it’s illegal, it’s illegal,” said Kimberly Mutcherson, dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School which focused on reproductive rights.  (In the first three months of this year, 22 states introduced more than 100 restrictions on abortion pills approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights.)\nStill, organizations like Planned Parenthood are keeping an open mind about how they might raise and distribute funds.\nAlexis McGill Johnson, the organization’s president and CEO, said Planned Parenthood was “looking into a number of things” in the cryptocurrency space, but would not divulge specifics.\n“At the end of the day, all options are on the table,” she said.\n\nSource Link",

But the death of mother octopuses after they reproduce has long been a scientific spectacle.\nWhy exactly mother octopuses engage in a form of self-harm that leads to death right after breeding remains a mystery.  But a study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology uses the California two-spotted octopus as a model to help explain the physiology of this strange behavior.\nZ. Yan Wang, assistant professor of psychology and biology at the University of Washington and author of the study, explained that the female of the species goes through three stages of reproduction.\nAfter mating, the mother produces her eggs and handles them with care.  She takes each egg, one at a time, carefully threading them into long strands.  Then she cements them to…",

But Zibanejad scored two one-time slapshots in 76 seconds to tie the game.\n“There is no giving up,” Zibanejad said of the comeback.  “That’s what I love about this team.”\nA few minutes later, there was another crazy breakaway.  The game started when Rangers keeper Igor Shesterkin took advantage of a poor Penguins line change and delivered a perfect 100-foot pass on Zibanejad’s stick.  Zibanejad was alone again.\n“His passing is better than all of us sometimes,” Zibanejad said of Shesterkin’s stickwork.\npenguin keeper Louis Domingue made the initial save on Zibanejad, but Kreider was there with his teammate, and he slammed the rebound to put Rangers ahead, 3-2.  If that sounds like the Game 5 scoring pattern at Madison Square Garden, it was, and would continue, until the last goal in an empty New York net at the end.\nEvgeni Malkin scored for the Penguins to even things up, 3-3, on a breakaway late in the second period.  The game remained tied until just 1:28 remained.  Kreider then fired a high slap shot which Domingue saved in front of his chest, but the puck spun over his head and landed behind him and into the net.\n“Nobody said it was going to be easy,” Penguins defenseman Kris Letang said.  “They are a very good team. They have a lot of talented players who can score goals.\n\nSource Link",

The driver stopped on a freeway off-ramp, she said, and an officer boarded, saying the bus was mistakenly driving in the left lane.\nWithin five minutes, she said, one of the student-athletes drew attention to officers pulling backpacks, team duffel bags and other belongings from under the bus. – for inspection by a drug-sniffing dog.  Then two officers boarded the bus announcing a drug search in an interaction that Ms Jenkins, who is black, described as “racially motivated”.\n“When he raised narcotic dogs, the first thing he went to was marijuana, which is stereotypically associated with African Americans,” Ms Jenkins said.  She added that the officer had an “accusatory tone: he was not asking”.\nWhen a student asked how the routine traffic stop turned into a drug search, she said, an officer replied that charter buses on this section of the highway were known to drug and human trafficking.  Although nervous and scared, Ms Jenkins said she tried to stay calm, as students gathered by the window to look outside and others sat in shock.  She said she feared a single bad word could inflame the situation.\nThe university’s student newspaper, the hornet, published an article on traffic control by Sydney Anderson, a member of the team.  Ms Anderson and the other team members did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\nMs Anderson wrote in the article that the police tried to get the players to admit they had drugs, and she accused them of carrying out an unlawful search without probable cause.  She said “the majority of the team members had never encountered the police, which made this a traumatic incident for them”.\n\nSource Link",

Thanks to a GM scholarship, she earned a master’s degree in business administration at Stanford.  Since entering the executive ranks, she has held leadership positions in global manufacturing, human resources, product development and supply chain management.\nIn January 2014, she succeeded Daniel F. Akerson as CEO and became the first woman to lead a major automotive company.  Ms Barra guided GM through a scandal stemming from a faulty ignition switch linked to crashes that claimed more than 100 lives.  She then made a series of decisions that showed that the General Motors that had just come out of bankruptcy was not the conservative, weighty giant that consumers and investors had known for a century.\nIn a move that would once have been unthinkable, it decided to withdraw from the European market, a slow-growing, low-margin region where GM had been posting losses for two decades.  GM has sold its European operations to French Peugeot SA, which is now part of Stellantis.  The sale included the Opel division, which had been owned by GM since 1929.\nRemoving loss-making businesses that had been tolerated for years “helped change the mindset,” she said.  “The whole company kind of said, ‘Well, it’s a new day.  “”\nGM, which had long prided itself on developing its own technology, also acquired an automated vehicle startup, Cruise Automation.  In another unprecedented move, GM brought in outside investors, including Honda and T. Rowe Price, to share the costs and risks of spending billions of dollars on self-driving vehicles.\nAlong the way, Ms Barra formed a close partnership with Mr Reuss, a contemporary who had been a candidate for the top job in 2014. He too spent his career at GM and had followed his own father, Lloyd Reuss, a former president of the company.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "This includes using observational data and two sets of computer simulations, one that models the world as it is, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than it is. was before widespread emissions began in the late 19th century, and a hypothetical world in which global warming never occurred.\nThe conclusion that the likelihood of such an extreme rain event has increased with global warming is consistent with many other studies of individual events and larger trends.  One of the main reasons for this increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.\nThe study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in a given year, although not common, is not a rare event.  The researchers therefore looked at other factors that could have contributed to the high death toll and damage caused by the disaster.\nAmong these, they wrote, were the legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era.  In 1958, for example, Durban City Council passed a measure that forced non-whites to settle in areas that were less desirable and, in many cases, more prone to flooding.\nThe researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements due to rapid urban growth and lack of affordable housing.  Around 22% of Durban’s population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which generally lack proper services and infrastructure.  During the April floods, the study noted that about 4,000 of the 13,500 homes that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most deaths also occurred in these areas.\n“Once again we see how climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people,” said Friederike Otto, founder of World Weather Attribution and a climatologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSource Link",

He said he wanted more details about the volume of spam and fake accounts on the platform. \nThen, about two hours later, Mr. Musk tweeted again.  He was “still committed” to the acquisition, he said, without giving further details. \nThe seemingly conflicting messages left many wondering if Mr. Musk had cold feet, was trying to drive down the acquisition price, or was looking for some attention.  Maybe it was a combination of all three.  Twitter shares yo-yoed in response to his posts.\n\n\nAs with many things involving Mr. Musk, it was difficult to know his thinking.  He did no…",

He mentally wrote down thousands of words so that the system would reliably recognize the unique patterns of neural activity specific to each letter and produce words on a screen.  “You really learn to hate M’s after a while,” he told me with characteristic good humor.

          "description": "Dr Özel said the new image’s similarity to that of 2019 demonstrated that the previous image was no coincidence.  In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the black hole M87 was 1,500 times more massive than that of the Milky Way;  typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.  “The similarity on such a huge scale is amazing,” said Dr Galison.\nAt Thursday’s press event, Michael Johnson, a member of the team and also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, said, “This is an extraordinary verification of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. “\nEinstein’s Bad Dream\nBlack holes were an undesirable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which attributed gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, in the same way that a mattress sags under a sleeper.\nEinstein’s insight led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which spacetime could quiver, bend, tear, expand, swirl, and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole, an entity with a gravity so strong that not even light could escape.  this.\nEinstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be dotted with black holes.  Many are the remnants of dead stars that have collapsed in on themselves and continued to advance.\nBut there seems to be a black hole at the center of almost every galaxy, including ours, which may be millions or billions of times more massive than our sun.  Astronomers still don’t understand how these supermassive black holes got so big.\nParadoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.  Materials – gas, dust, jagged stars – falling into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.  Some of this material falls into the black hole, but some is thrown out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.\n\nSource Link",
