          "description": "Thousands participated this week in a lavish ceremony in the Marshall Islands marking the first formal coronation of a paramount chief in around 50 years.\nThe colourful event, which also attracted thousands of viewers on social media, saw Michael Kabua crowned \"Iroojlaplap\", or paramount chief, on Thursday night as warriors and guests from the 12 atolls and islands he oversees gathered in a show of respect.\nThe coronation, held on the small island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll, is known as a \"Kailoojoj\" in Marshallese -- a ceremony reserved only for paramount chiefs.\nIt was the first coronation for the royal family since Kabua’s cousin, Iroojlaplap Joba, who died in 1982, ascended to the throne in the 1970s.\nThe blowing of a conch shell heralded each stage of the elaborate ceremony, whic…",

Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.\nPelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: \"Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese.\"",

Along the route where he rides his bike several times a week in Lenexa, another Kansas City suburb, more and more road signs have appeared on either side of the issue.\n“It brought everything to the fore,” said Markert, who was retired from the mortgage industry and who said his opposition to abortion in almost all cases was motivated by his Christian faith.  “If Roe vs. Wade wouldn’t have been upset, I think ‘Vote Yes’ would have been ‘more likely to win.  He added: “I don’t know if it’s now.”\nAs Election Day approached, the rhetoric heated up.  Campaign placards on both sides have been stolen or destroyed, according to police and organizers.  In the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, vandals target a Catholic church this month, splashing buildings and a statue of Mary with red paint, an episode that police have linked to the abortion debate.\nTwice in the past few weeks someone tore down signs supporting the amendment at Faith Baptist Church in Salina, Kansas, pastor Jesse Rowland said.  A third sign has been placed in the cemetery.\n“It’s a bit more of trench warfare – everyone is entrenched on one side or the other,” Mr Rowland said.  “No one is talking, really, from what I’ve observed.”\n\nSource Link",

In the first installment, we looked at the chances of a stalemate and a partial Russian victory.

Between the two prospects, this analysis reveals that Moscow has a chance of defeating Ukraine while Kyiv has virtually no chance of defeating Russia. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: What is note-worthy in the above post is the admission that Ukraine is losing 1,000 soldiers a day (killed and wounded), and that most of its best fighters have now been eliminated.
