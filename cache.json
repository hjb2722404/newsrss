Many still have no access to power or the internet.\nHundreds of residents in Windsor, one of the worst-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, have been heading home to face up to the wreckage after their third flood this year.\nTaking advantage of easing conditions, trucks moved into flood-hit neighbourhoods to clear debris on Friday, social media images showed. Along with the emergency crews, the military will also help residents in cleaning homes and roads, Sullivan said.\nRiver catchments and dams were already near full even before the drenching from the latest storm, which burst river banks and submerged farms, houses, roads and bridges.\n\"We should start to see those waters recede in all of the rivers, some of them slower than others,\" Sullivan said.\nMore than 700mm (28 inches) of rain have fallen since Saturday over many areas in New South Wales, more than Australia's annual average.\nA La Nina weather system, typically associated with higher rainfall, has dominated Australia's east coast weather for a second straight year.\n(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Tom Hogue)",

          "description": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz   \nThe UnHeard: The German economy is on the brink  \nPutin can't be blamed for the country's economic malaise \nThe economist Herbert Stein once wrote that if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. It seems like the German — and with it probably the European — economy is reaching that point. Most of Europe’s 100 largest companies were founded in the 1980s or before, which means that the old continent has entirely slept through the digital revolution of the 1990s and 2000s. There is no European counterpart to American corporations like Facebook, Amazon, E-Bay or China’s Alibaba or WeChat. \nThis became painfully clear during the Covid pandemic, when the once vaunted German bureaucracy was revealed to rely on paper, pens and fax machines in its health care system due to a complete lack of digitalisation in key areas. Not surprisingly, the German economy shows cracks elsewhere as well. Measured by market capitalisation, only one German company makes it into the top 100 worldwide, and German market capitalisation as a share of global market capitalisation has shrunk to 1.97%, an all-time low. These are devastating numbers for a country that just a few years back was seen as a model for the world with its transition to Green energy and the planned exodus from nuclear power.   \nRead more ....\nUpdate: Germany: Unprepared for a perfect storm (ING) \n Update #2: \"Social Peace Is In Great Danger\": Germany Is Quietly Shutting Down As Energy Crunch Paralyzes Economy (Zero Hedge)   \nWNU Editor: Germany's economic malaise/problems were present long before the Russia - Ukraine war. It is just that with the energy crisis not engulfing Europe because of Russian sanctions and other disastrous EU decisions, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the German and EU economies are now being exposed. The end result of this crisis is predictable. We will not only see the de-industrializing of Germany, but a lower standard of living for most if not all of Europe.",

The embargo of Russian fossil fuels has resulted in sky-high energy prices, while food prices have also surged as a result of the sanctions and Russia’s blockage of Ukrainian grain exports. As both Ukraine and Russia are among the world’s biggest exporters of wheat and other grains, the conflict is threatening food security across the globe, especially in poorer regions that rely on imports from both countries.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I am willing to bet that when winter arrives this European unwillingness to \"pay the price\" to defend \"democracy\" in Ukraine is only going to increase.",
