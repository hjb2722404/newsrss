The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.\nAuthorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.\nInitial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.\nBy Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.\n\"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening,\" one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.\n\"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification.\"\nEarly on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.\n(Reporting by Liz Lee, Bernard Orr and Ethan Wang; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Clarence Fernandez)",

          "description": "A few dozen Holocaust survivors on Tuesday led a march in southern Poland to commemorate victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau, on the eve of the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.\nEvery year, thousands of people from around the world -- both Jewish and not -- take part in the event held at the site of the former death camp built by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland.\nOne million European Jews died at the camp in the city of Oswiecim between 1940 and 1945 along with around 80,000 non-Jewish Poles, 25,000 Roma and 20,000 Soviet soldiers.\nThe camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945.\nThe 35th edition of the March of the Living began with the doleful sound of the shofar -- a traditional Jewish ram's horn symbolizing freedom -- at the notorious \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" (Work Will Set You Free) gate at Auschwitz.\nThe three-kilometre march was notably attended this year by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch.\nOn Wednesday, Warsaw will commemorate the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which broke out 80 years ago on April 19, 1943.\nThe presidents of Israel and Germany will be in attendance and are expected to visit the site of the former Jewish district.\nThe Germans confined up to 450,000 Jews to an area of just over three square kilometers -- most of whom died of starvation or disease inside or were taken to a death camp to the east of Warsaw.\n© 2023 AFP",
