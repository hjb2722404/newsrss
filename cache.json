The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

He gave Reuters video clips he took of smoke billowing from the upper floors of the hospital.\nAuthorities are investigating Beijing's deadliest fire since at least 2002, when a blaze at an internet cafe killed 25.\nInitial checks showed the fire, which mostly affected a wing for critically ill patients, was caused by inflammable painting material at a ward under renovation, the officials said.\nBy Wednesday, many social media posts critical about the fire on WeChat had been either censored or deleted, Reuters checks showed.\n\"Rescue work at the scene concluded in 3-1/2 hours, but the public only knew that 21 had died from the fire when it was already past eight in the evening,\" one person wrote in a WeChat post subsequently deleted.\n\"It is very puzzling that little information was known about a fire killing 21 people in a densely populated major city like Beijing before the official notification.\"\nEarly on Wednesday, 39 injured were still in hospital, three in critical condition, and 18 serious, the officials told the briefing.\n(Reporting by Liz Lee, Bernard Orr and Ethan Wang; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Clarence Fernandez)",
