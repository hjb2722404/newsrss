He had a career-high 945 rushing yards in 1962.\n\n\nDonald Anthony Perkins was born on March 4, 1938 in Waterloo, Iowa.  He played for New Mexico from 1957 to 1959 and captained the team in its final two seasons.  The Lobos’ coach at the time, future Hall of Famer Marv Levy, said Perkins was one of the greatest players he ever coached.\nPerkins returned to the Albuquerque area after his professional football career ended.  He then worked as a television and radio football analyst.\n\n\nInformation about survivors was not immediately available.\n“Don is one of the greatest Lobos, and certainly one of the greatest football players to play for UNM,” New Mexico athletic director Eddie Nuñez said.  “He came back to New Mexico and worked for the state and was a tremendous ambassador for so many people.”\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "A Russian court on Tuesday extended the pretrial detention of WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner on drug trafficking charges until July 2, pushing her stay in prison beyond four months, according to the official TASS news agency.\nThe Moscow region Khimki court granted the 18-day extension at the request of investigators, the agency said citing the court’s press service.  It is typical for Russian courts to prolong detention several times until trial.  Ms Griner’s lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe American basketball star was arrested four months ago after Russian officials said they found vape cartridges containing traces of hash oil in her luggage as she walked through Sheremetyevo airport, the Moscow’s main international airport.  The charge carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.\n\n\nMs Griner was arrested on February 17, a week before Russia invaded Ukraine, but authorities did not reveal she was detained until days after the war began, raising fears that not be used as a bargaining chip in the global crisis.  There has been speculation that once convicted, Ms Griner could be part of a prisoner swap with the United States.\n\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Ms. Griner plays for the Phoenix Mercury and US officials meet with the team on Monday to discuss efforts to secure his release.  In May, the State Department said it determined Ms Griner had been “wrongfully detained.”\nWhen taken into custody, Ms Griner was returning to Russia to perform for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team.  Many WNBA players supplement their income the league’s off-season playing internationally.\n\nSource Link",

However, the United States, along with the vast majority of the international community, does not accept China’s claims in this regard.

The move is not surprising. \nThe Navy has tried to rid itself of its cruisers for years, but Congress has consistently rejected its proposals, largely out of concern that decommissioning them would take away a much-needed weapon as China's naval force continues to grow. \nWith the retirement of the last battleships nearly 20 years ago, cruisers are the largest surface combatants — a category that generally doesn't include aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships — in service.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Concerns on where the US Navy is going are rising ....

Image credit: Creative Commons. \n19FortyFive: There Is No Military Path for Ukraine To ‘Defeat’ Russia \nThe Tide of Battle – and Mounting Casualties – Turning Against Ukraine – Since it became evident a few weeks into Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine that Moscow’s troops were stopped cold outside of Kyiv, there has been a near-universal belief in the West that Ukraine would eventually win. All that was needed, many pundits claimed, was to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s forces sufficient numbers of weapons and ammunition. As the war now grinds towards the four-month mark, it is becoming painfully evident that the odds are stacked in Russia’s favor. \nMilitarily speaking, there is no rational path through which Ukraine will ever win its war. Without a course correction – and soon – Kyiv itself may not ultimately be safe.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: You know the situation is deteriorating fast when Ukraine President Zelensky's top adviser is making an urgent request to NATO at their meeting this Wednesday for these weapons (see tweet below). \nUkraine had most of these weapons before the war, and to me this adviser is admitting that they now need to be replaced because most have been lost and destroyed. A testament to how brutal this war is becoming. \nI am also being told by one source in Ukraine that I trust that the Ukrainian military losses are not 100 - 200 soldiers a day, but two to three times that. If true, these numbers are staggering, and you cannot sustain a war with that type of losses, let alone mounting a counter-offensive to defeat the Russian military. \n\nBeing straightforward – to end the war we need heavy weapons parity:\n 1000 howitzers caliber 155 mm;\n 300 MLRS;\n 500 tanks;\n 2000 armored vehicles;\n 1000 drones.\nContact Group of Defense Ministers meeting is held in #Brussels on June 15.
