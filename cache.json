          "description": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in New Delhi arrested two people suspected of flouting fire safety regulations on Saturday after at least 27 people died in a blaze at a building housing a manufacturing unit for surveillance cameras.\nRescue teams worked overnight to clear the burnt out four-storey building near a railway station in the western suburbs.\nMore than 75 people were in the building when the fire broke out on Friday evening. Some jumped from windows to save themselves, according to eyewitnesses, and firefighters broke the glass and rescued people with ropes.\nAuthorities said fire started in an office on the first floor and spread rapidly. Two owners of the company were arrested as part of probe to identify suspected safety violations.\nOffering condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised 200,000 rupees ($2,580) in compensation for the victims' next-of-kin.\n(Reporting by Anushree Fadnavis; Writing by Nupur Anand; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",

Marcus Brandt/dpa\nUkrainian hopes of being able to repurpose frozen Russian assets to pay for war damage were dashed on Saturday as Germany's foreign minister highlighted the hurdles to such an approach.\nUkrainian officials have pushed for weeks for frozen Russian assets to be transferred to Kiev, to cover the costs of repairing destruction caused by Russia's invasion or even to pay for Ukraine's defence efforts.\nBut German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking at the end of a G7 foreign ministers' conference she hosted, said there were multiple problems with such an approach.\n\"Gaining access to frozen money is legally ... anything but easy,\" she said. She noted that there could be sound reasons to attempt such an act, but noted that they had to be aligned with the law.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had again proposed the idea at the session held on the Baltic coast.\n\"We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in Europe,\" he said, arguing that Russia should be forced to pay for the war, not only in political or economic terms, but also financially.\nBeyond legal issues, many European leaders fear attempts to liquidate and transfer Russian funds will lead to countries like Russia and China seeking to set up an alternative international financial system, which would make sanctions a weaker tool in the future.\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaks at the closing press conference of the G7 Foreign Ministers summit.

This meeting, which precedes a May 21 summit between Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden, reflects Yoon’s view that North Korea is the South’s “main enemy.”\nYoon’s presidency comes at a tumultuous time in U.S. foreign policy. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine continues, and it enjoys Chinese support. Strategic competition is expanding with Beijing in the Indo-Pacific. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has conducted 16 missile tests in 2022 so far. Raising the possibility of internal instability in North Korea is the COVID-19 outbreak that Kim has finally admitted to, after more than two years of claiming zero cases in the country.\nIn this context, the South Korea-U.S. alliance remains as important as ever. The upcoming summit provides an opportunity not only to reaffirm the alliance at the start of the Yoon administration, but also to build on the ROK-U.S. vision laid out in the May 2021 summit.\nDave Maxwell\nMon, 05/16/2022 - 11:58am\n\nRead more about Recommendations for Yoon-Biden Summit – Must Build on the Strong Alliance Foundation\nLog in or register to post comments",

The building at 555 Fulton St. by Steven Witkoff and Apollo – shown here for the first time – will occupy the wraparound corner where Fulton Street, DeKalb Avenue and Bond Street converge.\nDesigned by Beyer Blinder Belle, it will provide one lucky tenant with highly visible space with 7,902 square feet on the ground floor and an additional 6,459 square feet on the lower level.  The first pickaxe should take place soon.\nGoodSpace brokers Chris DeCrosta and Hank O’Donnell said the image isn’t quite final.  “Because this is a customizable building, we’ll market to see if a tenant wants a say in the final design,” DeCrosta said.\nThey target sports brands such as Nike or Adidas, “which could make sales of $40 million to $50 million a year,” DeCrosta said.  O’Donnell added: “It’s a place to do crazy business.”  Brokers refused to quote an asking rent.\nThe area is seeing a meteoric rise in commercial and residential development, including City Point, a new Ace Hotel and giant apartment towers from Extell, JDS and others.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "The only unknown was playoff experience and the ability to win on the biggest stage.  They certainly have that now to go with a generous dose of confidence.\nGallant had faith in Panarin, saying after the game he felt the Russian striker, even though he hadn’t come out on top earlier in the game, would pull through.  And he did, with just nine seconds left on the power play.  Panarin took the puck from Adam Fox at the top of the right face-off circle, skated a few steps toward goal, then shot right-footed, beating Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry on the short side through a screen and sparking a wild celebration on the ice and in the stands.\n“Honestly, they let me shoot since the first game,” Panarin said through an interpreter.  “My bad, I didn’t really do those shots. But maybe I should listen to everyone’s advice now and go out and take some shots.\nThe tying goal came with 5:45 left in the third period after a play that angered Penguins coach Mike Sullivan.  Pittsburgh’s Marcus Pettersson lost his helmet behind the Penguins goal after becoming tangled with Rangers forward Alexis Lafrenière.  According to the rule, Pettersson either had to find his helmet and put it back on or leave the ice for safety reasons.  Pettersson walked to the bench.\nKris Letang, Pittsburgh’s top defenseman, took Petterson’s place, but he skated to the net, past Jarry, and was unable to challenge Zibanejad’s shot.  And if Pettersson had been on the ice, he might have helped the Penguins clear the puck.  Sullivan, unsurprisingly, is not a fan of the rule.\n“I think it stinks,” he said.  “He has to go out.  His helmet was intentionally ripped off, but that’s the rule.\nFor the Penguins, who were in the playoffs for the 16th straight year, the loss was particularly hard to bear because it could be the last season for their longtime core of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Letang playing together.  These last two can be free agents and sign with other teams.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Farming is a high-risk life.  Mr Woiwode was 63 when his jacket was caught in the draft shaft of a hay baler, breaking three ribs, compressing his spine and nearly severing his right arm.  As a teenager, her son, Joseph, was trampled by a horse and spent days in a coma;  when he recovered, his motor skills still fragile, he almost lost his fingers because of a mower. \nOne day, setting fire to the weeds blocking a tractor, Mr Woiwode nearly set himself on fire and Joseph, then a toddler strapped to the seat with a cowboy belt.  During a cataclysmic blizzard one winter, it was so cold for so long that Mr Woiwode had to fuel his wood-burning furnace with the dead chickens that had frozen in their coop.\nBut the place also nurtured Mr. Woiwode’s family and work.\n“There is a thump that the virgin ground has here on unshaded ground, so different from cultivated land,” he wrote, “and in the colors of the surrounding painter, in light undimmed by pollution, you can feel like you’re on a soundstage.For a second, you see the entire panorama as being constructed to contain you in its stage.\nThe Woiwodes practiced the Presbyterian faith to which they had turned when their marriage was difficult, and Mr. Woiwode, who had been raised Roman Catholic, often wrote about his chosen faith, about the land and about the biblical stories that supported and shaped it.  This makes him an anomaly in literary circles, as well as in the liberal arts institutions where he taught for decades.\n“Most of life seems to me to be a religious experience,” Mr. Woiwode told the New York Times in 1988.  “I mean, I guess either it does or it doesn’t, and for me it does.”\nLarry Alfred Woiwode was born October 30, 1941 in Carrington, ND His father, Everett, was a high school teacher and principal;  his mother, Audrey (Johnston) Woiwode, a housewife, died when Larry was 9 years old.  He grew up in Sykeston, ND, then in Mason County, Illinois. \n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Kouchner adds, “My grandmother killed herself soon after that.”\nIt’s the second funeral in the book — “a militant, heartbroken crowd who’d come to pay tribute to my grandmother’s freedom to kill herself.”  The suicide leaves Camille’s mother an alcoholic shell.  She drinks herself blind every night: “This is absolutely not up for discussion.  It’s my freedom.”\nThe book is a sharply focused portrait of a certain kind of privileged French family of its era, first revolutionary and then bourgeois: their sexual mores, their thirst for power and fame, the collateral damage to children.  The violation of her brother is explained, midbook, in one sentence: “He started stroking me, and then, you know …”\nFrom this point, the narrator’s voice ages as she comes to understand what this means, and the book takes on aspects of a psychological thriller.  The twins keep the secret for years.  At last, fearful for the safety of their own children, strangled by a “hydra” of guilt and shame, they confide in other members of their family, to decidedly mixed reaction.\nThe book finishes, effectively, in the most adult voice of all, that of the law.  Camille Kouchner addresses her stepfather directly, reciting the text of the French penal code on incest.  “Let’s be clear about this,” she writes:\n\nArticle 222—31—1 of the criminal code\nRape and sexual assaults are classified as incestuous when committed by:\n1) ascending year;\n2) a brother, a sister, an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, or a niece;\n3) or any other person, including a partner or family member, having legal or de facto control over the victim.\n\nClaire Berlinski is the editor in chief of The Cosmopolitan Globalist.

Since the start of the year, Bitcoin’s price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq, a benchmark heavily weighted towards tech stocks, suggesting that investors are treating it like any other risky asset.\nEther’s price has also fallen, losing over 30% of its value over the past week.  Other cryptocurrencies, like Solana and Cardano, are also down.\nAny panic could be overdone, some analysts said.  A study by Mizuho showed that the average owner of Bitcoin on Coinbase would not lose money until the price of the digital currency fell below $21,000.  This, according to Mr. Dolev, is where a real death spiral could occur.\n“Bitcoin worked as long as nobody lost money,” he said.  “Once it gets back to those levels, it’s kind of an ‘Oh, my God’ moment.”\nProfessional investors who weathered the volatility in crypto also remained calm.  Hunter Horsley, managing director of Bitwise Asset Management, which provides crypto investment services to 1,000 financial advisers, met with more than 70 of them this week to discuss the market.  Many weren’t selling, he said, because all other assets were down as well.  Some were even trying to capitalize on the decline.\n“Their point of view is, ‘It’s not fun, but there’s nowhere to hide,'” he said.\nStill, the price crash has rattled crypto traders.  Just a few months ago, blockchain proponents predicted that Bitcoin’s price could hit $100,000 this year.\n\nSource Link",

But that’s not the only factor at play: a study published Wednesday confirms that, for the frequency of hurricanes, the effects of particulate air pollution are even more important.\nOver the past four decades, new research shows that the decline in pollution in the form of tiny aerosol particles from transportation, energy production and industry in North America and Europe was responsible for the increase in the number of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic.  .\nDuring the same period, increased pollution from the growing economies of India and China had the opposite effect, reducing hurricane activity in the western North Pacific, according to the study.\nA gro…",

But, she says, “I haven’t found any cryptocurrency where you can do that.”\nLawyers are not convinced that cryptocurrencies would protect patients in most cases.  Abortion bans “will cover everything whether you pay in cash or crypto,” said Rachel Rebouché, acting dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law and author of a forthcoming paper titled “The New Abortion Battleground.”\n“If abortion is illegal in your state — it doesn’t matter if you have a surgical abortion, a medical abortion, whether you self-manage your abortion — if it’s illegal, it’s illegal,” said Kimberly Mutcherson, dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School which focused on reproductive rights.  (In the first three months of this year, 22 states introduced more than 100 restrictions on abortion pills approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights.)\nStill, organizations like Planned Parenthood are keeping an open mind about how they might raise and distribute funds.\nAlexis McGill Johnson, the organization’s president and CEO, said Planned Parenthood was “looking into a number of things” in the cryptocurrency space, but would not divulge specifics.\n“At the end of the day, all options are on the table,” she said.\n\nSource Link",

He was an absolute horse.\nThe Rangers trailed 2-0 after one period and the Penguins, playing without Sidney Crosby, their star center and captain, were 40 minutes away from qualifying for the second round.  But Zibanejad scored two one-time slapshots in 76 seconds to tie the game.\n“There is no giving up,” Zibanejad said of the comeback.  “That’s what I love about this team.”\nA few minutes later, there was another crazy breakaway.  The game started when Rangers keeper Igor Shesterkin took advantage of a poor Penguins line change and delivered a perfect 100-foot pass on Zibanejad’s stick.  Zibanejad was alone again.\n“His passing is better than all of us sometimes,” Zibanejad said of Shesterkin’s stickwork.\npenguin keeper Louis Domingue made the initial save on Zibanejad, but Kreider was there with his teammate, and he slammed the rebound to put Rangers ahead, 3-2.  If that sounds like the Game 5 scoring pattern at Madison Square Garden, it was, and would continue, until the last goal in an empty New York net at the end.\nEvgeni Malkin scored for the Penguins to even things up, 3-3, on a breakaway late in the second period.  The game remained tied until just 1:28 remained.  Kreider then fired a high slap shot which Domingue saved in front of his chest, but the puck spun over his head and landed behind him and into the net.\n“Nobody said it was going to be easy,” Penguins defenseman Kris Letang said.  “They are a very good team. They have a lot of talented players who can score goals.\n\nSource Link",

Play will resume, again, as soon as the batters’ meeting is over and some time before the star third baseman turns on a box score.\nGiven Manny Machado’s torrid start for the San Diego Padres this season, it would be predictable to joke that the five-time All-Star plays chess while his peers play checkers.  But in Machado’s case, it’s also true: when he’s not beating opposing pitchers and stealing hits with acrobatic defensive plays, Machado can be found keeping his mind sharp with contemplation. calm on a chessboard.\n“Chess is interesting,” said Machado, who learned the game from former Orioles player and manager Brady Anderson in Baltimore in 2017. “It’s something you can’t just play. anticipate what …",

The driver stopped on a freeway off-ramp, she said, and an officer boarded, saying the bus was mistakenly driving in the left lane.\nWithin five minutes, she said, one of the student-athletes drew attention to officers pulling backpacks, team duffel bags and other belongings from under the bus. – for inspection by a drug-sniffing dog.  Then two officers boarded the bus announcing a drug search in an interaction that Ms Jenkins, who is black, described as “racially motivated”.\n“When he raised narcotic dogs, the first thing he went to was marijuana, which is stereotypically associated with African Americans,” Ms Jenkins said.  She added that the officer had an “accusatory tone: he was not asking”.\nWhen a student asked how the routine traffic stop turned into a drug search, she said, an officer replied that charter buses on this section of the highway were known to drug and human trafficking.  Although nervous and scared, Ms Jenkins said she tried to stay calm, as students gathered by the window to look outside and others sat in shock.  She said she feared a single bad word could inflame the situation.\nThe university’s student newspaper, the hornet, published an article on traffic control by Sydney Anderson, a member of the team.  Ms Anderson and the other team members did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\nMs Anderson wrote in the article that the police tried to get the players to admit they had drugs, and she accused them of carrying out an unlawful search without probable cause.  She said “the majority of the team members had never encountered the police, which made this a traumatic incident for them”.\n\nSource Link",

An independent inquiry is being set up to look into the government’s use of the Emergencies Act to suppress protests, and a joint Senate-House of Commons committee has held its own hearings.
