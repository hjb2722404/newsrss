But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "In an interview with FRANCE 24, Israel's former prime minister Ehud Olmert (2006-2009) said he believes Israel will be able to eliminate Hamas's military capabilities in Gaza, but he expressed regret at Palestinian civilian casualties from the Israeli offensive and stressed that time for the operation was \"limited\". Olmert said Israel should offer to start negotiations on a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority immediately after conclusion of the war. He also claimed that no Arab country would agree to replace the Israeli army in Gaza after the war, which is why he advocates a NATO-led military presence that would usher in a transitional civilian administration before final talks over a Palestinian state. Olmert slammed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, saying he had failed his citizens and boosted Hamas while weakening the Palestinian Authority: \"He is in a nervous breakdown.\"",

And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate.\"\nThe media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.\n\"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib,\" tweeted Chat Pergram.\nMelanie Zanona also tweeted: \"motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep.

Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. \nCapitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.\nAfter a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). \nThe news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",

Two soldiers held the flag in front of the battalion crest just between the Chigos and the plywood door into our command post. The captain and first sergeant stepped out of their offices. Members of Trudel’s platoon bore witness. I said a few words, and we raised our right hands. I reenlisted Private First Class Trudel.  Serving this cake was a minor act of rebellion.

However, we have seen the Americans take a series of irresponsible and escalatory steps with regard to Ukraine, and not only there,\" the senior diplomat said in an interview with RTVI. \"That is why, if we look at Washington’s current behavior model from this perspective, I don’t rule out anything at all.

But given the demand for the carrier air wing and delays to the Nimitz-class replacement—the Ford-class—the USS Nimitz (CVN 68) itself is unlikely to retire as soon as expected. \nThe Navy’s fiscal 2023 budget has already called to extend the first-in-class CVN 68, commissioned in 1975, for another deployment cycle instead of decommissioning it in 2025 as previously planned. Service officials say the upcoming budget request could include a final decision on extending the next in the class, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, beyond its 2027 projected end-of-service date—though extending just that ship likely will not be enough. \n Read more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The US Navy is also looking to speed-up production of future aircraft carriers ....
