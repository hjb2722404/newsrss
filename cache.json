          "description": "One year ago this Saturday, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died after being arrested by Iran’s morality police for wearing her hijab \"improperly\". Her death led to massive anti-regime protests, known by their now-iconic slogan: “Woman, Life, Freedom”. The Observers team has been in regular contact with dozens of women across Iran over the past 12 months. Many of them have told us that it has become the “new normal” for millions of women in Iran to go out in public with their hair uncovered. But with a new law under discussion that would massively increase the penalties for hijab-related offenses, how long will these new freedoms last?",

          "description": "DNYUZ/New York Times: Russia Overcomes Sanctions to Expand Missile Production, Officials Say \nRussia has managed to overcome sanctions and export controls imposed by the West to expand its missile production beyond prewar levels, according to U.S., European and Ukrainian officials, leaving Ukraine especially vulnerable to intensified attacks in the coming months. \nIn addition to spending more than $40 billion providing weapons for Ukraine, the United States has made curbing Russia’s military supply a key part of its strategy to support Kyiv. \nAs a result of the sanctions, American officials estimate that Russia was forced to dramatically slow its production of missiles and other weaponry at the start of the war in February 2022 for at least six months. But by the end of 2022, Moscow’s military industrial manufacturing began to pick up speed again, American officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the sensitive assessment now concede.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: So much for the Western political and media narrative that we have been hearing constantly for the past year that Russia was going to run out of missiles. \nOn a side note. \nThe above New York Times post reveals something that should give everyone pause .... \n .... it costs a Western country $5,000 to $6,000 to make a 155-millimeter artillery round, whereas it costs Russia about $600 to produce a comparable 152-millimeter artillery shell. \n You cannot win a war if the economies of production favors your opponent.",

Brown's speech at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's mega conference outside of Washington, D.C., the soon-to-be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs dropped two new images of the B-21 Raider. While the stealth bomber was rolled out in December of last year, it remains cloaked in secrecy. Brown, the top Air Force uniformed officer, didn't specifically reference the images in his presentation. \nUp until today, only one angle of the full aircraft has been seen by the public — head-on — and in a very controlled environment at the bomber's unveiling. Aside from a close-up of the cockpit area at an angle, all imagery published since then has been from the same head-on perspective, although it has progressively shown the aircraft in more detail. Now we have our first quartering view of the flying-wing jet, which provides significant details about its design. A new head-on image also gives us a better idea of the bomber's actual size. Both images were taken at Northrop Grumman's facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. \n\n \nRead more .... \nNew Images Emerge Of The B-21\n\n \nCSAF Shows Off New Images of the B-21; Raider Begins Engine Runs -- Air & Space Forces \nB-21 Raider stealth bomber: New images show US Air Force’s £585m cutting-edge aircraft -- The Independent\n \nNew B-21 photos released, as engine runs begin -- Breaking Defense\n \nNew Photos Offer Rare Glimpse at US' Classified B-21 Stealth Bomber -- Sputnik",
