The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Some have seized on discrepancies between two different videos of the assailant, one captured by a security camera, another by a police officer. These social media users claim that it looks like the assailant is wearing sneakers made by the brand Vans in one image and Pumas in another, proof, they say, that the whole thing was set up. We were able to determine that the shoes appear different due to the resolution of the videos in question – they are actually the same pair of Vans.",

JPMorgan has insisted that Dimon is “not relevant” to the lawsuit, saying that he wasn’t involved in any decisions related to Epstein’s account.\nSenior U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has denied the bank's motions to dismiss the case, saying there's sufficient evidence that JPMorgan knew Epstein was sex trafficking minors while they were doing business with him.\n\"Since being sued, JPMorgan filed a third-party lawsuit against their former senior executive Jes Staley, who later became the CEO of Barclays Bank. Staley has been under pressure after British regulators scrutinized the 1,200 emails that were exchanged with Epstein from 2008 through 2012,\" Law&Crime's report stated. \"The communications showed that Staley appeared to visit Epstein’s island Little St. James, while Epstein was still incarcerated. Epstein sent Staley multiple emails with photographs of a young woman, and regulators say he sent transfers of money to women with Eastern European surnames timed around Staley’s visits to his properties.\"\nIN OTHER NEWS: Watch: 'Shameful' Republicans mobbed by anti-gun protesters in Nashville\nThe Virgin Islands government argues that JPMorgan can’t make Staley the scapegoat for everything. \n“If Staley is a rogue employee, why isn’t Jamie Dimon?” Virgin Islands attorney general’s private counsel Mimi Liu asked on March 16, saying the key question in the litigation isn’t “whether or not Mr. Staley raped any young women in the Virgin Islands.”\n“The question is: What did he know?” Liu continued. “And Jamie Dimon knew in 2008 that his billionaire client was a child sex trafficker. Staley knew, Dimon knew, JPMorgan knew.”\nRead the full report over at Law&Crime.",

So, without a hint of irony, many of these same 'conservatives' now agitate to ban a platform owned by an international group that includes several American investors.\"\nPaul warned that prohibiting Americans from accessing Tiktok means that the US may \"emulate China’s speech bans,\" noting that the app is already banned in China.\nPaul also wondered, \"does TikTok do the Chinese government’s bidding?\" noting that \"videos are all over TikTok that are critical of official Chinese positions.\"\nAfter reiterating his fear of censorship, Paul concluded that \"if you don't like TikTok or Facebook or YouTube, don't use them.

          "description": "By Patricia Zengerle\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate easily passed legislation on Wednesday to repeal two decades-old authorizations for past wars in Iraq, as Congress pushes to reassert its role in deciding whether to send troops into combat 20 years after the last invasion.\nThe Democratic-led Senate voted 66-30 in favor of legislation to repeal the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for the Use of Military Force, or AUMFs, a bipartisan majority well above the 51 votes needed to pass the measure that would formally end the Gulf and Iraq wars.\nTo become law, the repeal of the two Iraq AUMFs must still pass the Republican-led House of Representatives, where Speaker Kevin McCarthy signaled support but told a news conference last week the matter should first be reviewed by a House committee, …",

Fellow commission member and survivor Peter Saunders also quit later that year.\"",

Noel Celis / Pool / Reuters \n Foreign Affairs: Xi Jinping Says He Is Preparing China for War\n\n \nThe World Should Take Him Seriously \nChinese leader Xi Jinping says he is preparing for war. At the annual meeting of China’s parliament and its top political advisory body in March, Xi wove the theme of war readiness through four separate speeches, in one instance telling his generals to “dare to fight.” His government also announced a 7.2 percent increase in China’s defense budget, which has doubled over the last decade, as well as plans to make the country less dependent on foreign grain imports. And in recent months, Beijing has unveiled new military readiness laws, new air-raid shelters in cities across the strait from Taiwan, and new “National Defense Mobilization” offices countrywide. \nIt is too early to say for certain what these developments mean. Conflict is not certain or imminent. But something has changed in Beijing that policymakers and business leaders worldwide cannot afford to ignore. If Xi says he is readying for war, it would be foolish not to take him at his word.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: To be fair. Chinese President Xi has been telling China to prepare for war for a very long time. From 2021 .... Xi Jinping orders China’s military to be ready for war ‘at any time’ (American Military News). \nBut the mood in China is different this time. The U.S. and China have always had their differences, but House Speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan last year was IMHO the straw that \"broke the camel's back\". And what is worse is that I sense the lines of communication between Beijing and Washington are now being shut down, and the rhetoric only becoming more hostile and confrontational.",

(DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Alexander Kubitza)   \nMilitary.com: Not Stopping Russia in Ukraine Would Force 'Doubling' of US Defense Budget, Milley Says \nThe top general in the U.S. military warned Thursday that not supporting Ukraine now would lead to a massive increase in future defense budgets -- and global conflict that has been avoided since World War II ended. \n \"If that rules-based order, which is in its 80th year, if that goes out the window, then be very careful,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley testified to Congress on Thursday. \"We'll be doubling our defense budgets at that point because that will introduce not an era of great power competition. That'll begin an era of great power conflict. And that'll be extraordinarily dangerous for the whole world.\" \nMilley's remark at a House Appropriations Committee defense subcommittee hearing comes amid growing skepticism from Republicans about the price tag of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Milley was testifying alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about the Biden administration's $842 billion request for Pentagon spending for fiscal 2024.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The proposed 2024 US defense budget is $886 billion ....

This is not because the Canadian Security Intelligence Service operates in a particularly clandestine fashion, it’s because most Canadians don’t care. \nThe CSIS, a civilian-run organisation based in a triangular structure of concrete and glass on the outskirts of Ottawa, lacks the intrigue of Britain’s MI5 and the notoriety of America’s Central Intelligence Agency. \n“I look nothing like Daniel Craig, and I did not arrive here in an Aston Martin. I’m just as disappointed as you are – on both fronts,” its director, David Vigneault, said in a speech in 2018, poking fun at the service’s largely uncharismatic reputation. “Most of you remember the movie Fight Club. And you will know that the first rule of Fight Club is ‘don’t talk about Fight Club’. Well, the first rule of CSIS has always been ‘don’t talk’. Period.”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: No one really knows where these leaks are coming from.
