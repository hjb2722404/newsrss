          "description": "British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.\nLead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.\nGahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.\n\"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil,\" he said of their 19th tour.\nThe band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words \"Berlin 4.10.22\".\nCredited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, \"Spirit\", in 2017. \"Memento Mori\" will be their 15th studio record.\nDepeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.\nThe band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as \"Personal Jesus\", \"People Are People\" and \"Enjoy the Silence\".\nThe group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.\n© 2022 AFP",

The most recent analysis revealed that Black women only earn 58 cents for every dollar paid to white men.  This is five cents less than the previous year’s data.\n\nBut even more worrying than growing pay disparities is that the stress of discrimination in the workplace makes many black women physically ill.  It’s time for corporate America to address the inequalities in the workplace that particularly harm the well-being of black women. \n\nDiscrimination in the workplace impacts all aspects of black wo…",

Where did this idea originate and is there any truth to it?  Here’s what to know about if inspectors come.\nWhere did the Republicans get that number from?\nThe 87,000 figure comes from a Treasury report released in May 2021 that evaluated a proposal to provide the IRS with additional funding of $80 billion.

(MCSN Larissa Dougherty/U.S. Navy) \nDefense News: US Marines warn against Navy’s FY24 decommission scheme \nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Navy has spent more than four years repairing one of its amphibious ships, blowing past its budget by at least $99 million. Yet, the ship is still not ready to deploy. \nAfter pouring nearly $300 million into its repairs, the service says it would prefer to simply decommission the ship and move on. \nIn fact, the Navy would like to decommission the nine other vessels in this class of amphibious dock landing ships, all of which need significant repairs. Some have more than a decade of planned service life left, but the Navy says it would rather spend its money on other capabilities than attempt to repair them. \nBut the Navy isn’t the primary user of these amphibious platforms. The Marine Corps relies on these ships to carry its Marine expeditionary units, which are considered the nation’s crisis response force. But the Corps’ ability to keep forces spread across the globe and quickly react is at risk. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: There is also disagreement on what the future light amphibious ships should look like ....
