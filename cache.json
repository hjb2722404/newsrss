          "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Wednesday, South Korea's military said.\nThe launch comes after Pyongyang on Tuesday demanded that the United States and South Korea stop large-scale military exercises, calling them a provocation that may draw \"more powerful follow-up measures.\"\nBroadcaster YTN reported that an air raid warning was issued on the South Korean island of Ulleung around the time of the missile launch. A spokesman for South Korea's military said they were checking to see whether the air raid warning was related to the missile launch.\nThe United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday, with hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day.\nNorth Korea has test-fired a record number of missiles this year, and has said that a recent flurry of launches were in response to the allied drills.\n(Reporting by Soo-hyang Choi; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Gerry Doyle)",

Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept,\" he continued. \"I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist.\"\n\"Surrender is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress... With a fair amount of fun along the way.\"\n© 2022 AFP",

Officials swung into action, organizing a series of calls between Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and several of the country’s biggest oil refiners to discuss strategies to boost stockpiles. The tone was cordial, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. \nBut the very next working day, the oil industry was blindsided. At a hastily arranged press conference on Oct. 31, President Joe Biden castigated Big Oil for handing “outrageous” profits to shareholders and executives rather than bringing down prices at the pump. Unless that changed, he warned, oil companies faced more taxes. “Their profits are a windfall of war -- the windfall from the brutal conflict that’s ravaging Ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe,” he said.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: As I have mentioned before.

Uncle Sam is getting squeezed by higher borrowing costs, too. \nThe cost to finance America’s growing mountain of debt is rising rapidly as the Fed scrambles to put out the inflation fire by raising interest rates and shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. \nDuring fiscal 2022 alone, the federal government made $475 billion in net interest payments, up from $352 billion the prior year, according to the US Treasury Department. For context, that’s more than the government spent on veterans’ benefits and transportation – combined. And it’s nearly as much as the $677 billion spent on education.    \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: The Government Is Set To Spend More On Debt Payments Than The Entire Defense Budget (Daily Caller) \nUpdate #2: Federal interest payments soar, soon will exceed cost of entire defense budget (Convention of States)   \nWNU Editor: If current trends continue, one can easily see interest payments becoming the biggest expense in the US Federal budget by 2030.",
