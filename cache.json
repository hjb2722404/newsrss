Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing's sovereignty claims are void as the People's Republic of China has never governed the island.\nA Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.\nThe close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Additional reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)",

          "description": "On Thursday, The Globe and Mail reported that the Greater Vancouver Zoo is being sued after a toddler was attacked by bears into whose enclosure she had reached.\n\"The notice of civil claim filed in British Columbia Supreme Court by the girl’s guardian, Richard Hanson, says the August, 2019, incident left her with a fractured wrist, and one of her fingers was partially amputated,\" said the report. \"The lawsuit filed last month alleges the zoo and K-Bros Developments Corporation, which owns the property in Langley, B.C., owed a duty of care to the child, who was two years old at the time, given their control of the premises and the bears.\"\n\"It says the girl had reached through an 'unguarded chain link fence' at the zoo’s black bear exhibit and a 'group' of the animals 'attacked and mauled' her arm,\" said the report. \"BC Emergency Health Services issued a statement shortly after the incident, saying a patient had been airlifted from the zoo in serious condition. Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court.\"\nThe lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being \"vicious\", but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.\n\"The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide 'any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions' on the premises,\" said the report. \"It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl.\"\nZoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of \"petting or feeding\" the animals.",

But France’s nuclear sector has been going through a tricky time, as a significant proportion of its reactors have had to close for maintenance. Analysts blame a mixture of bad luck and the consequences of a political deal from a decade ago.\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Europe’s energy crisis and climate change racks the world, you could expect France to be congratulating itself on its vast fleet of nuclear power stations.

Pilot Scott Crossfield carried the aircraft to an altitude of 52,341 feet and reached a peak speed of Mach 2.11. \nThe flight kicked off a robust testing effort, and over the next nine years, three X-15 aircraft flew 199 times. The program eventually surpassed performance targets and achieved what is still the nation’s the fastest piloted hypersonic flight at Mach 6.72, or 4,520 miles per hour. Though it ended in 1968, discoveries from the program continue to inform the government’s hypersonic vehicle research.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Currently, Russia is the indisputable leader in the hypersonic weapons race and is gaining valuable operational experience with the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle and the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM), which is said to have a maximum speed of Mach 10 (link here).",
