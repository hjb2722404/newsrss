          "description": "The trailers for Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” one of the summer’s most anticipated movies, have raised some intriguing questions.  Is it a western?  Horror movie?  science fiction?  Satire?  Will it live up to the expectations raised by Peele’s first two jaw-dropping surf features, “Get Out” and “We,” or confuse them?\nI can now report that the answer to all of these questions is: Yeah.  That is to say, there are fascinating internal tensions in the film, as well as impeccably managed suspense, sharp jokes, and a seductively unnerving atmosphere of general weirdness.\n“Nope” seems less polemical than “Us” or “Get Out”, more at ease in its idiosyncrasies and flights of imagination even if it follows, in the end, a more conventional narrative path.  This might be cause for some disappointment, since…",
