          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r The Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study (HKIAS) at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) continues to connect scholars around the globe, allowing them to explore interdisciplinary ideas and address real-world issues. \r \r The most recent HKIAS Distinguished Lecture Series on Electronics and Photonics, held in March and April, was  supported in part by Kwang Hua Educational Foundation. The discussion topics covered nanotechnology, antenna design, 6G networks and much more, with five leading scientists outlining the latest research and potential applications of breakthrough technologies. The series attracted an international audience of over 2,000 scholars and guests. \r  \r \r The power of plasmonic biosensors\r \r \r \r Nanotechnology and its biosensor applications are becoming ever more prevalent in the field of biomedical microsystems. \r \r Kicking things off on March 1, Professor Stella W. Pang, Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Director of the Centre for Biosystems, Neuroscience, and Nanotechnology at CityU, spoke about “Nanotechnology for High-Performance Devices and Sensors”.   \r \r Noting the increased use of plasmonic sensors, she explained the ability of nanoimprint technology “to generate a large area of nanostructures within a few seconds”, showing high reproducibility and throughput. The novel 3D multiple layer plasmonic biosensors exhibit enhanced electric fields and a much higher sensitivity. This made it possible to detect lung cancer A549 live cells and nanoscale DNAs at very low concentrations by monitoring the highly sensitive resonance peak shift. \r \r Also, hybrid coupling of plasmonic and photonic crystal modes leads to a record high sensitivity of 1376 nm/refractive index unit. “Combining these biosensors with 3D engineered platforms, we can separate cancer cells from normal cells for identification, which will further improve the sensitivity such that cancer patients could be diagnosed at a much earlier stage, potentially saving millions of lives,”…",

In 1986, the Italian justice system launched a counter-offensive, with the Palermo prosecutor's office leading the charge. Judge Giovanni Falcone became a symbol of the fight against the mafia but on May 23, 1992, he was killed in a car bombing, along with his wife and three bodyguards. His colleague and friend Paolo Borsellino was murdered less than two months later. Three decades on, our correspondents report on how these assassinations by Cosa Nostra sparked an awakening and an ongoing fight against the mafia.",

In December 2020, the Bangladeshi government decided to relocate some of the Rohingya refugees to a remote island in the Bay of Bengal.

At 5-foot-9, Gauff is about the average height of top players these days, but she has long legs.  This can help her cover a lot of ground in a few quick steps, but it can make balls that sit low on grass and hard courts a little more difficult for her.\nIf there was a common thread running through Gauff’s first three matches, it was how often she was well placed.  The balls hit the clay and bounce right into her strike zone, giving her a series of belt-high fastballs she can play on, while taking advantage of the extra split second the clay gives her to put her feet or slide into position.\nAlways aggressive and on the hunt for forehands, she will inevitably make her share of mistakes, but so far she has hit more winners than unforced errors, which is always a good sign for any player.  She also rarely appeared unbalanced.\n“I really like sliding,” she said.  “I think it helps me recover faster after I reach the ball. Then also, I mean, I play pretty hard on my forehand, so I think the clay bounces the ball even higher.\nFor her part, Anisimova, 20, also spent most of her childhood in Florida, but she said she became more comfortable on clay largely by playing numerous junior tournaments in the Latin American countries, where red clay is also much more common than her.  is in the United States.\nAnisimova is a dangerous returner, capable of punishing slower serves, especially with her near-death backhand.  She also knows that her footwork and movement may be the weakest part of her still-developing game, and longer points on clay inevitably require her to cover more ground.  Clay makes his weakness a little less weak. \n“It gives me more time,” she said of clay after her victory over Muchova.  “Hard courts can sometimes be a bit too fast.”\n\nSource Link",

Mayor Roxann Wedegartner’s response demonstrates that she is not listening to a diverse constituency and failing to collaborate with city officials and employees.  First, she said she would consider appealing the verdict (with taxpayers’ money).  She does not seem to grasp that racism is pervasive in all American institutions.  No matter how well-meaning European Americans are, change will never happen without this fundamental recognition.  The court’s decision is an invitation, a mandate, to review the policy and make amends.  Let the judgment be an opportunity for change, not hunkering down with secure blinders.  Second, alleging that he lied under oath, Wedegartner discharged the white police officer who testified on behalf of the black officer who brought the case.  And she confined him to his house during working hours!  Is she judge, prosecutor and jury?

          "description": "More importantly, though, it negated nearly all of the reviews.  It was instructive, for example, to read most Madrid media accounts of the Mbappé deal.  Rather than a defeat for Madrid, Mbappé’s decision was presented as that of a mercenary and a traitor, a defector who gave his word to Pérez and then betrayed him.\nMbappé’s family were so distressed by this depiction that his mother decided to correct it publicly, claiming on Twitter that her son had never ‘gave his word’ to Real Madrid.\nThat he chose ‘El Chiringuito’ for his first appearance to discuss Super League was no accident either.  The show regularly features prominent Madrid supporters journalists known to burst into tears over the club’s successes, or rail against those – Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard – who are deemed to have brought dishonor to the club.\nThe spectacle is not, in this, an outlier.  Pérez oversees a vast network of soft news media, dependent not only on his grace and favor for information and access, but also intimidated by the breadth and weight of his business interests.  Pérez always claimed he was only powerful because he was Real Madrid president, but that’s not entirely true.  It is also powerful in many other ways.\nThis allowed him to lead Real Madrid as he sees fit.  Despite its size, the club’s hierarchy is relatively tight, with many recruitment decisions overseen by Pérez;  its general manager, José Ángel Sanchez;  and his chief scout, Juni Calafat.  Real Madrid is, in that sense, something of an aberration, almost a throwback to a time when most of its peers have diversified and deepened their personnel.\nPérez would say, of course, that it works: five Champions League finals in nine years is all the proof he needs.  This is perhaps his greatest gift.  No matter what he does, no matter how unlikely it seems, Pérez has a remarkable ability to emerge triumphant.\nThis may have been the year that destabilized the kingdom he so painstakingly built.  Rather, it could turn out to be the year that cemented him for good.\n\nSource Link",

Yet here we are again.  Nineteen children and three adults died in another senseless act of gun violence in my home state of Texas.  My heart is broken.  I’m frustrated.  I seethe. \n\nThis tragedy comes just 10 days after a racially motivated mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, that killed 10 people.  Almost a decade after 20 freshmen and six adults were murdered in Newtown, Connecticut.

It is one of the largest remaining undeveloped parcels of land in the area. \nZiegler, who died in 1905, bought it around 1900 to use as a summer residence.\n“There will never again be an opportunity for the city to control the fate of this property, or add an asset to all of us like this,” Darien First Selectman Monica McNally said at an April meeting of the City Board of Selec…",

Bank strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was the main author of this document.\nA note from bank investors placed the fair value of bitcoin at the same level in February.  It was trading around $43,000 at the time.\nCrypto has outmoded real estate as the preferred “alternative asset” of the bank, along with hedge funds, continues the note.  This mentioned:\n\n“So far, there is little evidence of VC [venture capital] funding dries up after Terra’s collapse.  Of the $25 billion in VC funding year-to-date, nearly $4 billion has come after Terra.  Our best guess is that venture capital funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018/2019 would be avoided.\n\nVenture capital funding would be key to avoiding this crypto winter, he added.\nOn the same day, the great venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its fourth cryptocurrency fund at $4.5 billion.  Also on Wednesday, crypto-focused venture capital firm NGC Ventures launched its third blockchain fund with $100 million raised from investors such as Babel Finance, Huobi Ventures and Nexo Ventures.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly said expressed his personal antipathy to cryptocurrency, going so far as to call it a fraud, but the bank itself has taken a more practical stance.  This becomes the first major bankin the Metaverse earlier this year.  Dimon praised crypto for its ease of cross-border payment.\n\nSource Link",

It is either an administrative or a criminal offence in 13 and two treat it only as an administrative offence, Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said.
