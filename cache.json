          "description": "On July 7, 2021, Haiti's then-president Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by a commando of mercenaries in Port-au-Prince. Two years on, his widow Martine Moïse, who survived the attack, spoke to FRANCE 24 from the Haitian capital. Although several suspects have been arrested over the murder, \"the present government seems to be involved\" and \"things are not going well in Haiti for the investigation\", Moïse said. Nevertheless, she insisted that \"the truth will come out\" eventually.",

I know places in Canada would love to have you,\" Trudeau said in a message on Twitter Wednesday evening that quickly went viral. \"So, don't make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.\"\nThe artist had just announced the addition of new dates to her consistently sold-out Eras Tour, which began in March in Arizona.\nShe plans more than 100 concerts through the summer of 2024 -- in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia, but none in Canada.\nThe bad blood risks turning Swift into something of an anti-hero in famously nice Canada. Last month, a conservative lawmaker lamented what he called the singer's lack of respect for his country and similarly implored her to save some dates for Canada.\nSwift last came to Canada in 2018.",

The Agency is as uncertain about Volodymyr Zelensky's thinking and intentions as it is about Vladimir Putin's. And as the Russian leader faces his biggest challenge in the aftermath of a failed mutiny, the Agency is straining to understand what the two sides will do—because President Joe Biden has determined that the United States (and Kyiv) will not undertake any actions that might threaten Russia itself or the survival of the Russian state, lest Putin escalate the conflict and engulf all of Europe in a new World War. In exchange, it expects that the Kremlin won't escalate the war beyond Ukraine or resort to the use of nuclear weapons. \nAmerica's stance is under threat because the near-mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group, raises the question as to whether Moscow has run out of options.\n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: Newsweek is only confirming what everyone knows.
