But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Some have seized on discrepancies between two different videos of the assailant, one captured by a security camera, another by a police officer. These social media users claim that it looks like the assailant is wearing sneakers made by the brand Vans in one image and Pumas in another, proof, they say, that the whole thing was set up. We were able to determine that the shoes appear different due to the resolution of the videos in question – they are actually the same pair of Vans.",

          "description": "By Maytaal Angel\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul showed no sign of abating on Saturday, despite its suspension by the embattled premier this week, as tens of thousands took to the streets to demand it be scrapped entirely.\nBeset by the domestic upheaval and expressions of concern and disapproval in Washington, Netanyahu on Monday paused the overhaul to allow negotiations on a compromise between his religious-nationalist coalition and opposition parties.\n\"We don’t believe anything that comes out of Bibi's (Netanyahu) mouth. We believe it’s just a political stunt aimed at stopping the protest,\" said Emanuel Keller, 30, at a protest outside the Israeli presidential residence hosting the talks.\nOne of the main points of contention is the ruling coalition's push for more power in appointing judges, including to the Supreme Court.\nCritics see the government's drive as a threat to the court's independence and an attempt at a legal coup. Proponents say it is seeking a less elitist, interventionist bench.\nNetanyahu, on trial on corruption charges he denies, says reforms are needed to balance the branches of government. His Likud party and political allies in the far-right have been calling on their political base to stage counter demonstrations.\nIsraeli media estimated more than 150,000 people attended anti-government protests nationwide on Saturday, the largest in commercial hub Tel Aviv.\n\"We're going to win because this is not something that we can live with. We cannot live in a state that is not democratic,\" said Limor Moyal, at the Tel Aviv demonstration.\n(Additional reporting by Natalie Thomas in Tel Aviv; Writing by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Mark Potter)",

But the Dutch capital’s famed prostitution windows will now close earlier — and they could soon move to a different part of town.

On Jan. 8, barely a week after Lula began his third term as president, Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the federal capital Brasilia to protest the election result.\nAfter about three months in self-imposed exile in the United States, Bolsonaro returned to Brazil this week.\nDatafolha interviewed 2,028 people on Wednesday and Thursday in 126 cities. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus two percentage points.\n(Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Paul Simao)",

As the Fed hiked interest rates, the value of those bonds dipped, but would have been repaid in time if not for the bank run.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Here we go again.
