          "description": "The summer of 1994 was uncharacteristically warm for Great Britain. Hot, sunny days were followed by close, sticky nights — and by the end of June, pressure had started to build. The last week of the month was an explosive one, meteorologically and culturally. On Friday June 24, an exceptionally severe thunderstorm hit the south east of the UK, diffusing so much grass pollen it triggered a sudden and short-lived asthma epidemic. Two days later, and after years of mounting speculation, the British press broke the news that Prince Charles had accidentally revealed his unfaithfulness to Princess Diana during an ITN documentary. (When asked if he had stayed loyal to his wife, the Prince of Wales nodded. \"Yes absolutely,\" he said before adding of his marriage \"until it became irretrievably broken down.\")",

          "description": "French journalist Laurent Richard founded Forbidden Stories in 2017 with a simple mission: to continue the work of journalists who have been assassinated or otherwise silenced. That same year, Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bomb. The organisation worked to continue her investigations and identify her killers, exposing corruption at the highest levels of the Maltese government. For Richard, the ultimate goal of Forbidden Stories is twofold: to bring crucial reporting to the world and to deter crimes against journalists by showing that \"it doesn't make sense to kill a reporter when there are 50 others ready to carry on their work\". He joined us for Perspective as we mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists.",

Amid that, eight in 10 likely voters describe things in the country today as \"out of control,\" as opposed to \"under control.\" \nThat doesn't bode well for the party in power: Republicans are winning those who say \"out of control\" right now by more than 20 points, though they're often the ones feeling that way to begin with.   So where do things stand?   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: The US Senate races appear to be close .... Its a dead heat for the US Senate (FiveThirtyEight).  \nUpdate #2: It looks like some Governor-ships are flipping Republican .... Governor’s Races Enter Final Sprint on a Scrambled, Surprising Map (New York Times).   \nWNU Editor: The CBS/YouGov poll does not say how much of their sample size is Democrat/Republican/Independent. \nFiveThirtyEight says it is a dead heat, but when you look at their map projections it looks like the Republicans are going to pick up a minimum of two seats. \nThe New York Times assessment on the governor-ships is blunt. A number of Republican pick-ups.\nBottom line. It is going to be a good night if you are a Republican.",

(Taiwan Ministry of National Defense via AP)   \nStraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons \nSince the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. \nDefending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. \nPreventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.\n\nThe same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.",
