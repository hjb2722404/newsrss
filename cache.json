They’re typically staggered by neighborhood, and don’t happen all at once; four hours off, four hours on, like that, all day, a checkerboard of light and dark, hot and cold, across the capital.

Officially, the gunman is believed to have acted alone, but Khan said he suspected the assailant was merely a decoy serving the interests of a state-level conspiracy. He directly accused current top Pakistani government leaders, saying they feel threatened by his party's popularity in view of the next elections in the country. Khan also said he feared he could be attacked again in the near future: \"They think that the only way to get me out of the way is actually [to] eliminate me.

          "description": "A rare inscription that sheds new light on the use of Canaanite language some 3,700 years ago has been discovered on an ivory comb in southern Israel, archaeologists said Wednesday.\nThe comb was found at the Tel Lachish site in 2017, but the letters were not noticed until earlier this year following further examination, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said in a statement.\nThe artefact provides \"direct evidence\" of the use of the Canaanite alphabet in daily life, said Yosef Garfinkel, an archaeology professor at Hebrew University.\nThe 17 letters inscribed on the comb, which was used to remove lice, form seven words that translate to \"May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard,\" the statement said.\n\"This is the first sentence ever found in the Canaanite language in Israel,\" Garfinkel noted, calling it \"a landmark in the history of the human ability to write\".\nLachish, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem, was a key Canaanite city.\nArchaeologists have found 10 inscriptions there, but the comb marks the first \"entire verbal sentence\" written in the language spoken by the inhabitants of ancient Lachish, the statement said.\nIt noted the comb itself was likely an imported luxury object, as there were no elephants in Canaan, and therefore no ivory.\n© 2022 AFP",

          "description": "Russia enters recession, GDP shrinks 4% in third quarter © Provided by WION \nMoscow Times/AFP: Russia Falls into Recession \nRussia's economy has entered a recession as gross domestic output fell by four percent in the third quarter, according to first estimates published Wednesday by the national statistics agency, Rosstat. \nThe drop in GDP follows a similar four percent contraction in the second quarter, as Western sanctions pummel Russia's economy following Moscow's offensive in Ukraine. \nThe four percent drop in economic output between July and September was less than the 4.5 percent contraction analysts had expected.  The contraction was driven by a 22.6 percent plunge in wholesale trade and a 9.1 percent drop in retail trade. \nOn the bright side, construction grew by 6.7 percent and agriculture by 6.2 percent.                                                                                                                                                    \nRead more ....                                                                                                                                                   \nUpdate #1: Russian Economy Shrinks 4% in Third Quarter - Statistics Agency (Reuters) \nUpdate #2: Russia enters recession, GDP shrinks 4% in third quarter (WION)                                                                                                                                                   \nWNU Editor: I have said it many times in the past. Russia's economy is weird. \nThe economy is in recession but everyone is working. The ruble is one of the strongest currencies in the world, even though the West has imposed comprehensive sanctions. The country is so filthy rich when it comes to resources that I think only the surface has so far been scratched, and there are buyers for everything that is produced. There is no government debt (it actually has a surplus). And everyone has a side hustle that I know is off the books even though I would estimate it represents a fifth of the economy.",
