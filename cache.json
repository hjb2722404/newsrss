Biden referred to the MAGA movement as an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of democracy. Despite facing low approval ratings and concerns about his age, Biden is focused on protecting democratic institutions. He chose Arizona, near the McCain Institute, to honor the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican who prioritized country over party. Biden aims to avoid alienating moderate Republicans while addressing the spread of anti-democratic rhetoric.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

The staff suffered no harm,\" said Bruno Rodriguez in a post on social media platform X.\nThis was the second attack against the Cuban mission in Washington in recent years, after a man opened fire on the building in April 2020. There were no injuries from that attack. \nThe Sunday night attack took place hours after Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel returned to Havana after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York and other activities with Cubans in the US.\nIn New York, there had been demonstrations by Cubans resident in the United States against Diaz-Canel's presence at the UN, according to posts and videos shared on social media.\n\"The anti-Cuban groups resort to terrorism when feeling they enjoy impunity, something that Cuba has repeatedly warned the US authorities about,\" said Rodriguez after Sunday's attack.\nIn April 2020, the Cuban foreign minister summoned the then US charge d'affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, to express his \"energetic protest\" over what he called a \"terrorist aggression\" against his embassy.\nThat shooting left bullet holes in exterior walls and columns, broke a street lamp and damaged several panes of glass and moldings on the front of the building. \nUS authorities arrested Alexander Alazo, then 42, for the attack.\nAlazo was indicted in July 2020 and charged with multiple offences, including \"violent attack on a foreign official or official premises using a deadly weapon\", according to the US Justice Department. \n© Agence France-Presse\nuscuba",

Thus far, it has been used by more than 10,000 Ukrainian servicemen who were subsequently taken into Russian custody, according to a source with knowledge of the situation cited by TASS. The person added that the radio frequency is active along the entire front line. \nRead more .... \nUpdate #1: Over 10,000 Ukrainian fighters surrender since summer using special radio frequency (TASS). \nUpdate #2: The source named the number of people who used the open frequency 149.200 “Volga” to surrender military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Top War) \nWNU Editor: Ukraine is also claiming the same thing. Aside from paying people to defect .... Ukraine pays USD 500,000 to Russian pilot who surrendered with Mi-8 helicopter (Euromaidan), Kyiv is also making the claim that Russian soldiers are surrendering ....

This year, No one  \nThe front line in Ukraine changed little in the winter. Russia aimed to capture the entirety of the Donbas, but it only inched forward. \nUkraine has made minimal gains in its counteroffensive. Dense Russian minefields and fortifications have made every attack extremely costly. \nDespite nine months of bloody fighting, less than 500 square miles of territory have changed hands since the start of the year. A prolonged stalemate could weaken Western support for Ukraine. \nBoth sides started the year with lofty ambitions: Russia wanted to capture the eastern Donbas region, while Ukraine aimed to split Russian forces with an attack in the south. \nNeither offensive has gone to plan. The front line, after months of combat and heavy casualties, remains largely unchanged.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: One Map Summarizes Status Of Ukraine War & Russia's Strategy (Zero Hedge)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Two things stick out in the above New York times report.

I see the opposite. This Ukraine counteroffensive has burned its best troops and thousands of pieces of Western equipment, and in any other situation a government would sue for peace. But the West, specifically the U.S. government and some of its allies, are hell-bent on continuing this war. They are going to continue the flow of monies and war equipment to Kyiv, even if it will mean the death of hundreds of thousands of more Ukrainians. And if President Biden is re-elected in 2024, God only knows where this conflict is going to end.",
