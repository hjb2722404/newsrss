The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

The news of the pardon has since been spreading rapidly across social media, providing a glimmer of hope in a country that has been ravaged by nine long years of war. According to our Observer, the decision to spare the man's life was due in large part to the intervention of his mother, who camped out at the grave of the victim to beg for forgiveness. This act of mercy is being hailed as a powerful source of inspiration and a symbol of the enduring resilience of the Yemeni people.",

Yet, such was the grip of National Socialism on German society that even in this remote place there was scarcely any aspect of Nazi rule or of the Second World War that did not touch its 4000-odd inhabitants one way or another. Their accounts, in turn shocking, revealing and moving, lead us to ask that all-important question – “what would I have done?”\nLike so many of their fellow citizens, Oberstdorfers—deeply Catholic and conservative by nature —were drawn to Hitler by his promise to implement strong government, to expunge the ignomin…",

          "description": "In a further attempt to rein in increasing numbers of women defying the compulsory dress code, Iranian authorities are installing cameras in public places and thoroughfares to identify and penalize unveiled women, the police announced on Saturday.\nAfter they have been identified, violators will receive “warning text messages as to the consequences”, police said in a statement.\nThe move is aimed at “preventing resistance against the hijab law,” said the statement, carried by the judiciary’s Mizan news agency and other state media, adding that such resistance tarnishes the country’s spiritual image and spreads insecurity.\nA growing number of Iranian women have been ditching their veils since the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in the custody of the morality police last September. Mahsa Amini had been detained for allegedly violating the hijab rule. Security forces violently put down the revolt.\nStill, risking arrest for defying the obligatory dress code, women are still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country. Videos of unveiled women resisting the morality police have flooded social media.\nSaturday's police statement called on owners of businesses to “seriously monitor the observance of societal norms with their diligent inspections”.\nUnder Iran's Islamic sharia law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes to disguise their figures. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest.\nDescribing the veil as \"one of the civilizational foundations of the Iranian nation\" and “one of the practical principles of the Islamic Republic,” an Interior Ministry statement said on March 30 that there would be no retreat on the issue.\nIt urged citizens to confront unveiled women. Such directives have in past decades emboldened hardliners to attack women. Last week a viral video showed a man throwing yoghurt at two unveiled women in a shop.\n(Reuters)",

          "description": "King Charles III on Thursday said he backed an investigation into the British royal family’s ties to slavery in the 17th and 18th centuries — an issue he takes “profoundly seriously,” according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson. The significant announcement is believed to be the palace’s first instance of public support for research into the royal family’s much-debated involvement in the enslavement of African people. Charles, who ascended to the throne after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, last September, expressed support for the research after the British newspaper The Guardi...",

          "description": "Protesters started a fire at one of French President Emmanuel Macron's favorite restaurants in Paris on Thursday during clashes with riot police at the upmarket left-bank brasserie.\nStaff at La Rotonde in the Montparnasse area of the city were forced to put out flames on the awning of the restaurant where Macron held a victory party during his successful 2017 election bid.\nAn AFP journalist saw a group of men dressed in black fire fireworks and throw stones in the direction of the eatery.\nThe fire was caused by a flare thrown on to the fabric awning, with firefighters needed to extinguish it.\nRanks of riot police formed to protect the business on the 11th day of national protests and strikes against Macron's widely unpopular bid to increase the retirement age to 64 from 62.\nThe red velour sofas and soft lighting of La Rotonde, a Belle Epoque hang-out once frequented by Picasso, have long been a favorite of Macron and his wife Brigitte.\nThe former investment banker held strategy meetings there as he prepared his bid for the presidency in 2017 and has been known to eat there with his wife since winning power.\nIn a decision criticized as elitist by his opponents at the time, Macron used La Rotonde to host staff and political allies for a party after he topped the first round of voting in 2017.\nThe restaurant has been targeted before because of its association with the 45-year-old president.\nIn 2020, during violent anti-government protests by so-called \"Yellow Vests\", a suspected arson attack left its entrance damaged.\n\"When there are marches and so on, you hear people saying 'Death to the Rotonde, Death to Macron',\" Gerard Tafanel, who owns the bistro with his brother Serge, told AFP at the time.\n\"It happens all the time: anonymous phone calls, people who enter in the middle of the day saying 'Death to Macron'.\"\n© 2023 AFP",

Michael McCaul has said the US may send troops to Taiwan should China invade the self-governed island. \n“If communist China invaded Taiwan, it would certainly be on the table and something that would be discussed by Congress and with the American people,” the Texas Republican told Fox News. \n“Are they prepared to do this? Is Taiwan worth it? I can argue for a lot of reasons why it is.” \nThe potential move would represent a stark contrast to the th\ne war in Ukraine, where the US has sent billions in weaponry to Kyiv but has refused to send troops. \n\n“[To deploy troops,] you’re talking about an authorized use of military force that would come out of my committee or a declaration of war, which we haven’t utilized since World War II,” McCaul said during a three-day trip to Taipei at the head of a congressional delegation.\n\n \nRead more .... \n\n \nUpdate: Conflict with China 'last resort' but Congress will authorize troops if Americans support it: McCaul (FOX News).\n\n \nWNU Editor: I do not see the American public supporting a policy to go to war against China to defend Taiwan.

(Photo by Ludovic Marin/ Pool / AFP)\n\n \nPolitico:  Macron fails to move Xi Jinping over Russia’s war on Ukraine\n\n \nFrench leader also commits diplomatic faux pas at Beijing press conference. \nBEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping showed no sign of changing his position over Russia’s war on Ukraine after talks Thursday with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. \nOn the second day of Macron’s state visit to China, Xi took his long-standing line on Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — saying that “all sides” have “reasonable security concerns” — and gave no hint he would use his influence to help end the conflict. \n“China is willing to jointly appeal with France to the international community to remain rational and calm,” was as far as the Chinese leader would go during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. \n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: French President Macron And EU President Ursula von der Leyen belief that they could go to Beijing and change Chinese President X's mind on Russia just two weeks after President Xi told Russian President Putin that together they were going to make changes on a global level not seen in 100 years is baffling to me. \nAnd it gets worse from there. \nFrench President Macron talked more than twice as long as President Xi, and even more during the press conference. EU President Ursula von der Leyen's just issued threats .... Ursula von der Leyen warns China not to send arms to Russia (The Guardian). \nThe media optics showed both European leaders doing a lot of talking, but were they listening? My gut says no. \nBut what was really telling is that every-time Macron brought up Ukraine, you can tell by President Xi's sighs that he wanted to discuss other issues.",

Beijing is giving him the cold shoulder. \n The Biden administration called off Blinken’s planned trip to Beijing in February after a Chinese spy balloon traversed U.S. skies, but has since been trying to restart high-level talks.
