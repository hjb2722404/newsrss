It was a single word that raised the alarm for an expert in religious extremism.\n\"NOW THAT THE 'SEAL' IS BROKEN, IN ADDITION TO CLOSING THE BORDER & REMOVING ALL OF THE 'CRIMINAL' ELEMENTS THAT HAVE ILLEGALLY INVADED OUR COUNTRY, MAKING AMERICA ENERGY INDEPENDENT, & EVEN DOMINANT AGAIN, & IMMEDIATELY ENDING THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA & UKRAINE, I WILL APPOINT A REAL SPECIAL 'PROSECUTOR' TO GO AFTER THE MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE USA, JOE BIDEN, THE ENTIRE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY, & ALL OTHERS INVOLVED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ELECTIONS, BORDERS, & COUNTRY ITSELF!\" wrote Trump.\nThe use of \"seal\" may not be an accident, wrote religion reporter and extremism expert Jeff Sharlet. It may be a nod to far-right conspiracy theorists trying to interpret current events through end-times prophecy.\n\"QAnon & many fundamentalists will read this â & I donât think itâs a stretch to imagine Trumpâs people are aware of that â as both the indictment & 7th seal of Revelation, the opening of which heralds the second coming of Christ,\" wrote Sharlet.\nThe Seven Seals, described in the Book of Revelation, secure a book that appeared to John of Patmos in an apocalyptic vision. In the story, each seal breaking progressively takes the world closer to apocalypse, with the final seal portending the second coming and the final judgment against the world. \nThis could also bolster beliefs among some of the religious far right that Biden is the Antichrist â as some also believed of former President Barack Obama, Sharlet said.\nAll of this comes as Trump prepares to face arraignment in Miami on Tuesday, and as authorities brace for the possibility of violence from Trump supporters in the vicinity, supported by escalating violent rhetoric on pro-Trump corners of the internet.",

          "description": "-Lawyers for Ukraine at the top U.N. court on Monday rejected Russia's account of the downing of a Malaysian airliner as a \"rambling conspiracy theory\", in a case alleging Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.\nKyiv says that Moscow violated a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in July 2014.\nLast November, a Dutch court convicted two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist in absentia for their role in the downing of the airliner and sentenced them to life in prison. It found that Russia had \"overall control\" over the separatist forces.\nRussia at the time rejected the decision by the Dutch court. Last week, in hearings before the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, Russia said Ukraine's MH17 case was based on \"nonsense\" and offered a host of alternative explanations for what happened.\nOn Monday, Ukraine's lawyers hit back. One of them, Marney Cheek, told the court it had been \"subjected to a rambling conspiracy theory\" about the shooting down of MH17 which would be \"better relegated to the darkest corners of the internet\".\nKyiv has accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it had also tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has asked the court to find Moscow guilty of breaching its treaty obligations and order it to pay reparations.\nRussia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. It also says it has met its obligations under the U.N. treaty against financing terrorism. Russia will get a last chance to reply to Ukraine's allegations on Thursday.\nThe World Court case stems from 2017 and was filed well before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year.\n(Editing by William Maclean and Mark Heinrich)",

American forces have been experiencing an uptick in unsafe and unprofessional Russian aerial activity in skies over Syria and this may be tied in part to Iranian support for the latter's war effort in Ukraine. That's the view of the Air Force's top commander in the Middle East.Â \nRead more ....\n\nÂ \nWNU Editor: CENTCOM knows that the U.S. military presence in Syria (see map below) makes it an ideal target for Iranian backed groups in the region. But by deploying F-22s the U.S. is sending a message that if US forces are threatened or attacked they will respond.Â \nBut respond against who?Â \nThe F-22s are too valuable to be used on bombing missions. They are there to shoot down enemy planes. Or more specifically .... Russian military aircraft.Â \nYou can take this to the bank. If F-22s start shooting down Russian military aircraft, we will be on the brink of World War 3.",
