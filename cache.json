          "description": "Angela Lansbury, star of the drama series “Murder, She Wrote”, has died, the family of the British actress confirmed.  She was 96 years old.\nShe died “peacefully sleeping at home in Los Angeles” on Tuesday morning, Michael A. McConnell of Zero Gravity Management said in a statement on behalf of her three children.  Lansbury would turn 97 in just five days.\nThroughout her 80-year career, Lansbury has starred on the big screen, television and on stage.  She has won five Tony Awards, most recently in 2009 for her role in the Broadway revival of “Blithe Spirit”. \n\nLansbury starred in Disney’s 1991 animated musical “Beauty and the Beast”, voicing Mrs.  Potts, but is perhaps best known for starring as mystery writer Jessica Fletcher in the CBS hit “Murder, She Wrote,” which ran from 1984 to 1996. \nBefore her television career, she was considered one of the last movie stars of Hollywood’s golden age, CBS Los Angeles  reported.  She was a player signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1940s.\n    \n\nhot news\n\n  \nSource Link",

It is also the only Wright-designed house on the west bank of the Hudson River.\nConsisting of four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, the property is considered a modified Usonian style home.

Service officials now say they aim for drones to compose 60% of their carrier air wings, a sizable increase from the 40% goal cited in the past. \nLeading the way on that effort is Boeing's MQ-25 Stingray, and unmanned aerial refueling drone that Navy officials say could eventually take on new roles, such as intelligence-gathering. \nThe MQ-25 is expected to achieve initial operational capability by September 2025 and deploy aboard a carrier in 2026. \nIt will be the first purpose-built carrier-based drone in service with any navy, but it won't be the first drone that the US Navy has operated from a flattop.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The above article puts to bed any doubts that the US Navy is now committed to drones.",
