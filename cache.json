The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "Atlantic Council: Putin cancels Victory Day parades as Ukraine invasion continues to unravel \nWith Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations less than one month away, the Kremlin has taken the highly unusual step of canceling a number of military parades in regional capitals. Scheduled parades to mark the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi Germany have been called off in Kursk and Belgorod oblasts, which both border Ukraine. Victory Day celebrations in Russian-occupied Crimea have also reportedly been scrapped. \nThe cancellations are officially due to security concerns related to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, numerous commentators have speculated that Moscow is also increasingly short of tanks and is understandably eager to avoid highlighting the scale of the losses suffered by the Russian army in Ukraine. Whether the real reason is security issues or equipment shortages, the decision to cancel this year’s Victory Day parades represents a painful blow for Vladimir Putin that hints at the grim reality behind Moscow’s upbeat propaganda portrayals of his faltering Ukraine invasion. \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: There is a lot of speculation from Western media sources on why this year's Victory Day celebrations got cancelled in a number of regional capitals. Not enough tanks/equipment and security concerns are often cited. I think the reason why these parades were cancelled is more basic. Everyone's focus in Russia right now is on winning the war, and not on having a parade. \nUpdate: It is not only the Victory Day parades that are being cancelled .... May 1 parade in Moscow cancelled due to \"terror attacks\" threat (The New Voice of Ukraine).",

And how is it possible that he was able to copy and distribute those documents for months without the Pentagon noticing? These are some of the questions raised by the arrest of Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who is suspected of being behind the largest — and most embarrassing — leak of official secrets in the US since WikiLeaks in 2010. To answer these questions, it is necessary to revisit the attacks of September 11, 2001. \nTeixeira joined the National Guard, an auxiliary military corps whose main mission is to defend the United States in the event of war, immediately after graduating from high school three years ago. Following a background check, required for entry into jobs related to national security, he received clearance for access to high-level classified information. His assignment to an intelligence unit, in which he had to ensure that communications flowed properly as an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks, gave him access to restricted areas.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Former veteran CIA officer Larry Johnson in the video below makes a very compelling case on why Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira could not have leaked some of these documents.",
