Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS \nReuters: In Russia, the Talk Is of 'War' - Even From Putin \nMOSCOW, June 8 (Reuters) - For more than 15 months Russia has been fighting a war in Ukraine that the Kremlin refused to call a war - but that is changing: President Vladimir Putin is using the word \"war\" more often. \nWhen Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, he called it \"a special military operation\" - a euphemism the Kremlin, Russian ministers and state media mostly stuck to, even coining a new Russian acronym, the \"SVO\".\nCalling the conflict a war was effectively outlawed for the Russian media by a series of very broad laws soon after the invasion. The Russian media was ordered not to use the word war - and has either complied or shut down. \nBut in response to what Russia said was a major Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow, Putin last week used the word \"war\" four times in relation to Ukraine, according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: On Day One of the invasion I called this a war. All my friends, family members, and contacts in Russia have also been calling this a war. \nCalling this \"a special military operation\" may have made some PR sense at the beginning of the war, but it makes no sense now.
