Although the iconic \"Ding Ding\" has a long history, the company is heavily focused on the future, allowing students to get a taste of professional engineering to create the next generation of tram cars. Senior HKUST engineering students and EdTEch and Gifted Education expert Joseph Lin lead the program, which offers high school students a scaled-down version of the HKUST foundation program for first-year engineering. Before embarking on critical Grade 11 and Grade 12 course selections, students experience life as engineers by using the design process and building on existing STEMinn knowledge to ideate and construct prototypes, develop alternatives, select a solution, and refine until the final presentation.

By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 2001 hijacked plane attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people.\nIt came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. \"war on terror\" because of harsh interrogation methods that critics have said amounted to torture.\nThere were 40 detainees when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021. Biden has said he hopes to close the facility. The federal government is barred by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. mainland prisons.\nOn Thursday, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Abdul Rabbani and Mohammed Rabbani to Pakistan.\nBoth were arrested in 2002. Abdul Rabbani was an al Qaeda facilitator while Mohammed Rabbani was a financial and travel facilitator for prominent al Qaeda leaders, according to the Pentagon's website.\n\"The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.\nA total of 32 detainees remain, of whom 18 are eligible for transfer, the Pentagon said in its statement.\n(Reporting by Costas Pitas in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler))",

          "description": "French police on Thursday detained for questioning the husband of a woman whose dismembered body was found in plastic bags at different locations in a popular Paris park, a source close to the investigation told AFP.\nThe body parts of the woman had been discovered in the Buttes-Chaumont park in the north of the French capital earlier this month.\nProsecutors told AFP that an individual had been detained in the case but warned that no further information would be made public for now.\nThe discovery shocked residents of the capital where the park is hugely popular with joggers and families due to its unusually hilly landscaping.\nThe woman, 46, had been reported missing by her husband on February 6. The pair lived in the Seine-Saint-Denis department northeast of Paris, prosecutors said.\nThe Le Parisien daily, which first reported his detention, said that the couple had three children and the husband had only reported her disappearance a week after she vanished.\nPolice investigating the disappearance had not turned up any leads until now.\nPark workers found the lower torso of a woman in a plastic bag hidden under leaves and further remains, including the head, were found during a thorough search of the park by police a day later.\nFrench channel BFMTV had reported last week that the husband had come under suspicion in the investigation after giving contradictory evidence.\nProsecutors then launched another investigation into how this information had been leaked to the channel.\nBuilt during the major relandscaping of the French capital under Napoleon III in the 19th century, the park most recently starred as the setting for a romantic picnic in the third series of \"Emily in Paris\".\nIt has also been a popular setting for classic French films ranging from Eric Rohmer's \"The Aviator's Wife\" to Gaspar Noe's more recent film \"Love.\"\n© 2023 AFP",

Legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso, whose death will be commemorated for the 50th time on April 8, is the focus of this year's Madrid Contemporary Art Fair ARCO. Ricardo Rubio/EUROPA PRESS/dpa\nThe legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is the focus of this year's ARCO 2023, the contemporary art fair held in Madrid, a half-century after his death.\nThe 42nd ARCO was opened on Thursday by the King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.\nA hyper-realistic replica of Picasso's \"corpse,\" wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt typical of the artist and laid out on a kind of tombstone, is the star exhibit.\nSpanish artist Eugenio Merino's sensational sculpture, entitled \"Aquí murió Picasso\" (Here Picasso died), is a denunciation of the exploitation of the figure of the artist for commercial and tourist purposes, especially in Picasso's native city of Málaga.\nLong queues of onlookers quickly formed in front of the work, which is on the market for €45,000 ($47,600), according to the newspaper El País.\nMany visitors took photos and selfies. So far they are all invited guests - including politicians, art dealers, collectors and journalists - as the fair does not open to the general public until Friday. By Sunday, the organizers expect around 100,000 visitors.\nAlongside this sculpture, numerous works by Picasso himself, who together with the Frenchman Georges Braque is considered the founder of Cubism, are on display at the IFEMA exhibition centre in the Spanish capital.\nThere is no guest country at ARCO this year. The theme is \"The Mediterranean: A Round Sea.\"\nA total of 211 galleries from three dozen countries are taking part in ARCO 2023. After the host country Spain, Germany is the most strongly represented, with 29 galleries showing works.",

Peter Nicholls/Reuters\nReuters: Lockheed Martin Profits More From War Than Any Other Company on Earth \nWith such horrifying images from Ukraine, it is hard to imagine any winners, but there are those who profit from the war, specifically military contractors. U.S. military aid for Ukraine and nearby countries has reached $3.75 billion. Almost all U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine are from our stockpiles and will have to be replaced. This means a huge check to companies making military hardware and software. Lockheed Martin Corp is the largest U.S. defense contractor and the domestic company that profits the most from war. \nThe financial opportunity for Lockheed Martin and other large contractors is vast. America’s defense budget will be over $800 billion this year. (Here’s how Ukraine’s newly bolstered tank army compares to Russia’s.) \nLockheed Martin employs 116,000 people. The company reported a total of $66 billion in revenue in 2022 and a profit of $5.7 billion. It has a backlog of orders that stands at $150 billion. Last year, it was No. 55 on the Fortune 500.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. 2023 will be a very profitable year for Lockheed.",

The grim milestone was met with renewed promises of weapons from dozens of countries, but now that the buzz has died down, the harsh reality behind the handshakes and photo ops is slowly revealing itself. NATO fighter jets will not see combat in Ukraine, tanks will take months if not years to reach the battlefield. Long-term military underfunding is the root cause across Europe.
