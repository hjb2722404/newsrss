          "description": "Brian Mann covers the U-S opioid and fentanyl crisis for NPR. That means he talks to a lot of people struggling with addiction. Again and again, he's heard stories of people who have succumbed to their addiction — last year 112, 000 — more than ever in history.   \nBut when Mann traveled to Portugal to report on that country's model for dealing with the opioid crisis, he heard a very different story. Overdose deaths in Portugal are extremely rare.\nThe country has taken a radically different approach to drugs – decriminalizing small amounts and publicly funding addiction services – including sites where people can use drugs like crack and heroin. \nPortugal treats addiction as an illness rather than a crime. No one has to pay for addiction care, and no one scrambles to navigate a poorly regulated recovery system. Could Portugal's approach help the U-S fight its opioid epidemic?\nFor sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.  \nEmail us at considerthis@npr.org.",

          "description": "Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was criticized online Wednesday after social media users dragged up an old post in which she fully endorsed a now-arrested informant accused of lying about Joe and Hunter Biden of taking bribes from abroad.\nGreene posted on the topic in July 2023, saying, \"Joe Biden is a criminal and is compromised! And he is leading us into WW3 because Zelenskyy has proof of more Biden crimes.\"\n\"This is the FBI’s FD-1023 UNCLASSIFIED form from the FBI’s most trusted informant that reveals then VP Joe Biden took a $5 million dollar bribe from Zlochevsky to get Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired,\" Greene wrote at the time. \"Joe delivered by withholding $1 billion in US aid until Shokin was fired.\"\nAttached to that social media post were images purporting to show allegations made by the now-indicted claimant.\nUnfortunately for Greene, the internet never forgets.\n\nALSO READ: How Speaker Mike Johnson’s dream of bipartisan decency died in his hands\n\"This aged well....\" said historian Heather Cox Richardson Wednesday.\nLegal analyst Marcy Wheeler, of EmptyWheel, posted that it was, \"Super interesting, actually, given that Smirnov was involved in talks to end the war.\"\nNational security attorney Bradley P. Moss also chimed in Wednesday.\n\n\"Hi Congresswoman,\" he wrote to Greene. \"This person has been indicted for fabricating the whole thing, in reliance in no small part upon Russian disinformation efforts. Any comment?\"\nAn elections podcast host, Miles W., said, \"Aged like milk.\"\nThe issue of the arrest has been a thorn in the side of House Republicans, who sought to use the purported insider information in order to justify impeachment proceedings against President Joe Biden. Jim Jordan has suggested that the arrest doesn't change the fundamental facts of the case against Biden, but experts have suggested the opposite is true.",

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Tuesday, saying at a Fox News town hall that he might cut ties with the minority leader upon regaining the White House. \n“He’ll probably end up endorsing me. I don’t know that I can work with him,” Trump said, as NBC News reports. “He gave away trillions of dollars that he didn’t have to, trillions of dollars. He made it very easy for the Democrats.”\n\nThe Republican bigs' bromance soured after McConnell drew a line after Jan. 6, 2021 when hordes of Trump sympathizers stormed the Capitol to thwart the certification of the presidential election to then President-Elect Joe Biden.  \nMcConnell likened Trump’s role in the fiasco as a “disgraceful dereliction of duty” when he, along with 42 other Republicans voted \"not guilty\" when he was charged of incitement of insurrection.\nREAD MORE: Inside the neo-Nazi hate network grooming children for a race war\n\"There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. No question about it,\" McConnell said at the time. \"The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.\"\nThe Republican senator added, \"And having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet earth.\"\nMcConnell has yet to endorse Trump's third White House bid. \n\nIt's unclear if McConnell will even seek another term in office, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-TX). \n“That’s a decision for Mitch to make,\" Cruz said. \"Obviously, there’s a lot of bad blood between Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. Mitch will have to make that decision.

          "description": "Chile will once again try to resolve the mystery of what really killed the Nobel laureate poet Pablo Neruda, who many believe was poisoned by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a court said Tuesday.\nThe appeals court ordered the reopening of the investigation into the death of Neruda, who was a prominent member of Chile's Communist Party when military dictator Augusto Pinochet took power in 1973.\nIn a statement, the court said that the \"investigation has not been exhausted as there are precise procedures that can be carried out to clarify the facts.\"\nNeruda had been preparing to flee into exile in Mexico to lead the resistance against the Pinochet regime when he died in hospital just 12 days after the coup.\nThe government claimed the 69-year-old had died of prostate cancer.\nAn investigation into the cause of Neruda's death began in 2011 when Manuel Araya -- his driver and personal assistant -- asserted that the poet was given a mysterious injection in his chest just before he died.\nAraya died in June last year, aged 77.\nIn 2017, a group of Chilean and international experts concluded that Neruda did not die of cancer, but said they could not determine what did kill him.\nAnd in 2023, a scientific panel investigating Neruda's death was also unable to determine whether he had been poisoned, even though they detected dangerous botulism-causing bacteria in his system.\nJudge Paola Plaza ordered the probe to be closed in December 2023, but Neruda's family and the Communist Party appealed that decision soon after.\nNeruda is remembered especially for sensual poems about love.\nHowever, in recent years his romantic image has been tainted after his admission in his posthumous memoirs that he had raped a woman came to light after the emergence of the #MeToo movement.\nPinochet, who ruled Chile for 17 years, oversaw a regime that killed some 3,200 leftist activists and other suspected opponents.\nThe dictator died in 2006 aged 91 without ever being convicted for crimes committed by his regime.\n© 2024 AFP",

He earned admiration from Russia's disparate opposition for voluntarily returning to Russia the following year.\nHis death comes just a day before the official launch of campaigning ahead of a new round of presidential elections set for March 15-17.\nPutin oversaw changes to the constitution in 2021 that will allow him to run for two more six-year terms, meaning he could stay in power until 2036. Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.\nOn December 8 Putin announced his candidature for re-election and is widely expected to win, given the lack of political alternatives and the Kremlin's iron grip on the state apparatus.\nWith AFP.",

So, it's going to be pretty difficult.\"\n\"All I can think though, is that there's classified documents missing,\" Gill cautioned. \n\"Humm, I know. Highest bidder,\" agreed Goldberg. \n\"How is he going to get this money?\" asked Gill. \"I mean NRC [National Republican Committee] is broke, NRA [National Rifle Association] is broke, Trump's Save America PAC is bleeding cash from legal representation not just for him but his adult children, and Jared and Ivanka. So, I mean, I guess he can borrow it from Jared?\" \nLast month, Trump was hit with $83.3 million in damages after being found liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. He also faces millions in legal fees associated with his four ongoing criminal trials.\nALSO READ: How Donald Trump is spreading a dangerous mental illness to his supporters\nOn Friday, Judge Arthur Engoron slapped the $355 million demand on him after finding that he and his company inflated the value of Trump Organization properties to secure favorable loans and interest.
