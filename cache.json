The meeting, called a Synod of Bishops, allowed women and lay people to vote on Church affairs for the first time. However, the final report did not take a stand on LGBT issues despite discussions beforehand. The report mentioned the need to hear and accompany marginalized individuals but did not call for greater inclusion. LGBT advocates expressed disappointment with the report. The pope will close the gathering with a Mass on Sunday.",

          "description": "The extensive tunnel network built by the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip poses a significant threat to Israeli troops and the Palestinian population. Clearing and collapsing these tunnels is crucial for dismantling Hamas, but it is a challenging task that strips the Israeli military of its technological advantages. The tunnels provide Hamas with hiding places and the ability to choose the time and location of engagement. Israeli airstrikes have targeted these tunnels, but combating underground warfare is difficult due to the abundance of ambush opportunities.",

          "description": "Halloween celebrations in South Korea were subdued on the eve of the first anniversary of the harrowing party crush that killed 159 people. Many restaurants, bars, department stores and amusement parks are avoiding Halloween-themed events as a sign of respect for the victims. Few people clad in Halloween costumes were seen Saturday in Seoul’s popular Itaewon neighbourhood, the site of last year’s deadly surge when many revellers and others packed an alley, causing people to fall on each other like dominoes. The walls of the narrow, sloped alley in Itaewon were plastered with numerous Post-it notes with condolence messages that read “We won’t forget you” and “We’ll remember you”. A mourning station established in central Seoul received many visitors, who laid white flowers and burned incense in front of photos of the victims.  In Seoul’s Hongdae area, another entertainment zone, there were only a few people wearing Halloween outfits. Authorities have deployed thousands of police, emergency and other officials since Friday for crowd control and safety of pedestrians in Itaewon and 15 other major nightlife districts in Seoul. About 200 police officers were separately mobilised to monitor narcotics use and violent crime, according to Seoul police. “I offer a deep apology again by bearing the sorrow and heavy responsibility for the disaster in my heart,” Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon said on Friday. “The way to overcome the pains and sorrow of the disaster is preventing this kind of incident from happening again.” Bereaved families are to hold a formal memorial service on Sunday.  In January, a police special investigation team concluded that police and municipal officials failed to work out effective crowd control steps despite correctly anticipating a huge number of people in Itaewon. Investigators also concluded that police had ignored hotline calls by pedestrians who warned of swelling crowds before the surge turned deadly. The Itaewon crush caused a nationwide outpouring of grief as the dead were mostly in their 20s…",

By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

President Trump will also present classified information relating to the biased and politicized nature of the intelligence assessments that he and others rejected during the events in question. Collectively, this evidence will undercut central theories of the prosecution and establish that President Trump acted at all times in good faith and on the belief that he was doing what he had been elected to do.\"\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\n\"Mostly appears to be IC assessments of foreign interference,\" said legal analyst Bradley Moss in response to the new filing, in a post on X. \"This should be interesting.\"\nIt is unclear why Trump would put this evidence forward, as commentators have noted that Trump trying to actually prove his long-discredited claims of voter fraud and election rigging would not be relevant to the crimes of which he is accused. He is more broadly expected to mount an advice of counsel defense, although special counsel Jack Smith has long been laying the groundwork to destroy such a legal strategy.\nIronically, the other federal case against Trump that Smith is pursuing pertains to his alleged illegal theft and retention of classified information in unsecured boxes at his Mar-a-Lago country club in South Florida.",

          "description": "Time: Biden Cast Doubt on Gaza’s Death Toll. Palestinian Officials Responded With 6,747 Names \nIn the past three weeks, more than 1,400 people in Israel and 7,000 Palestinians have been killed amid fighting between Israel and Hamas. That is, if you believe the casualty figures coming out of the region. This week, U.S. President Joe Biden suggested that the Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which has been under heavy bombardment by Israel following Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre, is not to be trusted. \n“I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s a price of waging a war,” Biden said at a press conference on Wednesday. “But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.” The President didn’t offer further evidence for his skepticism of the Palestinian health ministry's data, which the U.S. State Department has cited both internally and publicly, in the latter case as recently as March. (When asked to provide evidence to support Biden's statement, the White House referred TIME to comments made by U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, who on Thursday reiterated the President’s assertion that the death toll cannot be taken “at face value” because the “Gaza Ministry of Health is just a front for Hamas.”) \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: This is the current death toll ....

          "description": "VOA: China's Top Diplomat Arrives in Washington for Talks Ahead of Potential Biden-Xi Meeting \nState Department — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in Washington Thursday for meetings with senior U.S. officials on bilateral and regional security issues as the two countries aim to maintain open communication channels. \n U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is hosting Wang at the State Department for a working dinner after meetings in the late afternoon. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan is holding talks with him at Blair House, near the White House, Friday.\nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Washington for high-level meetings -- Washington Post \nUpdate #2: As world roils, US and China seek to ease strained ties and prepare for possible Biden-Xi summit -- AP \nWNU Editor: US President Biden will be talking with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi tomorrow .... Exclusive: Biden set to speak with China's top diplomat Wang Yi on Friday, sources say (Reuters). The Chinese are hoping this will pave the way to higher level talks .... Wang’s trip to US ‘crucial’, to pave the way for higher-level of interactions (Global Times).\nAs to what is my take .... I am skeptical. \nThere is little common ground between the two governments. They differ on Taiwan, trade, the Israel - Hamas war, the Russia - Ukraine war, the South China Sea, and more importantly, they do not trust each other. Sighhh ..... but talking is better than not talking.",
