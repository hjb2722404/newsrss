This practice is known as gerrymandering. In the state of Ohio, most state lawmakers are Republican, despite only a slim majority of Ohioans identifying as GOP voters.

          "description": "Italy's National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault.\nAccepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum \"for having had 'le palle' (the balls) to invite me tonight\", according to Deadline and Variety reports.\nThe museum, which also organized a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as \"unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation\".\nIts \"Stella della Mole\" award was given to Spacey -- the star of Oscar-winning film \"American Beauty\" and drama series \"House of Cards\" -- for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi.\nSpacey on Friday appeared via videolink in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offenses against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.\nHis stellar career has been halted by large numbers of allegations of sexual offenses although he has not been convicted.\nThe actor was slapped with the fresh charges involving one man in November, taking the total number of charges he faces in the UK to 12.\nLast summer he appeared at London's Old Bailey court to plead not guilty to five charges of similar sexual offenses against three other men.\nNow on unconditional bail, Spacey will face a four-week trial in London, starting June 6, which will consider all the charges.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, \"deepfake\" video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.\nCave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.\nThe chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.\nThe Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave's website, asked the tool to produce a song \"in the style of Nick Cave\".\nOne of the AI-created verses runs: \"I'm the king of the abyss, I'm the ruler of the dark / I'm the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark.\"\n\"This song sucks,\" wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT's work \"replication as travesty\".\nHe followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn't, describing the process of writing as \"an act of self-murder\".\n\"Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don't feel,\" he wrote.\nHe added: \"Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit.\"\nCave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- \"I've got the fire of hell in my eyes.\"\n\"I have got the fire of hell in my eyes -- and it's ChatGPT,\" he concluded.\n© 2023 AFP",
