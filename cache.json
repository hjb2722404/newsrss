Bank strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was the main author of this document.\nA note from bank investors placed the fair value of bitcoin at the same level in February.  It was trading around $43,000 at the time.\nCrypto has outmoded real estate as the preferred “alternative asset” of the bank, along with hedge funds, continues the note.  This mentioned:\n\n“So far, there is little evidence of VC [venture capital] funding dries up after Terra’s collapse.  Of the $25 billion in VC funding year-to-date, nearly $4 billion has come after Terra.  Our best guess is that venture capital funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018/2019 would be avoided.\n\nVenture capital funding would be key to avoiding this crypto winter, he added.\nOn the same day, the great venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its fourth cryptocurrency fund at $4.5 billion.  Also on Wednesday, crypto-focused venture capital firm NGC Ventures launched its third blockchain fund with $100 million raised from investors such as Babel Finance, Huobi Ventures and Nexo Ventures.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly said expressed his personal antipathy to cryptocurrency, going so far as to call it a fraud, but the bank itself has taken a more practical stance.  This becomes the first major bankin the Metaverse earlier this year.  Dimon praised crypto for its ease of cross-border payment.\n\nSource Link",

She won his first Tony Award for this performance.\n\n\nShe starred in several Sondheim musicals, winning Tony Awards for playing the theater’s most famous stage mother, Momma Rose, in “Gypsy,” as well as the scheming pastry chef owner Mrs. Lovett in ” Sweeney Todd”.  His most recent Tony nomination, in 2010, was for his work in a revival of another Sondheim musical, “A little night music.”\nLansbury also won Tony Awards for a short-lived musical titled “Dear World” and a revival of Noël Coward’s play “joyful spirit.”\nHer last Broadway appearance was in a 2012 revival of “The best man», a play by Gore Vidal.\nLansbury also had a long career in film – she memorably voiced Mrs. Potts in ‘Beauty and the Beast’ – and in television, where she was the longtime star of ‘Murder, She Wrote’.\nThe Tony Awards are set to begin June 12 at 7 p.m. EST with an hour-long segment airing on Paramount+ hosted by Darren Criss and Julianne Hough, followed at 8 p.m. EST by a three-hour segment aired on CBS hosted by Ariana DeBose.\n\nSource Link",

One of the five passengers in the car, a student, Corey Pittman, 19, was killed.  Carter, who had just turned 18, was sentenced to life in prison.\nIn director Gilda Sheppard’s sympathetic documentary “Since I Been Down”, punishment is also a crime.\nFilled with archival visuals of Tacoma in the late 1980s and 1990s, when crack cocaine and gang violence took their toll, the documentary’s greatest strength is its listening tour, with Carter as the main guide.\n\n\nBecause Carter fired from a car, he was charged with aggravated first-degree murder, which carries an automatic mandatory life sentence.  (His reconviction hearing is scheduled for July 8.) He is not the only one facing harsh prison terms.  Washington state’s three-stroke sentence (which abolished parole in 1984) can be particularly difficult for young offenders.\n\n\nOver the decades, Carter expressed remorse, but it was his role as a beneficiary and leader of inmate-led initiatives, the Black Prisoner Collective and TEACH, or Taking Education and Changing History, that suggests a transformation.\nOther inmates here share their insights, as do two former detectives, some former gang members, and the mothers of victims and perpetrators.  One former inmate, Tonya Wilson, who served 17 years, is particularly insightful about the personal and societal forces that led to her incarceration.\nAnother prisoner said, “We say that a lot of the answers that people are looking for in society will be found in prison.\n“We caused pain,” said this inmate, “mainly because we are in pain.”\nFar from looking like an excuse, in “Since I Been Down”, this observation sounds like a way to take account and change.\nSince I’ve been down\nUnclassified.

She is also set to host a show starting next year on a streaming-only channel, MSNBC on Peacock.\nMs Psaki’s last day in the West Wing was May 13 and her appearance on television news was widely expected.  Speculations on his potential work at MSNBC started this year while she was still presiding over the White House pulpit.  Ms Psaki said at the time that she adhered to ethical guidelines while discussing future job prospects.\nShe is the second major hire by MSNBC from the Biden administration. Symone D. Sanders, a former spokeswoman for Vice President Kamala Harris, hosts a weekend show for the network.  Ms. Psaki said in a statement provided by MSNBC that her program would focus on “factual, thoughtful conversations about the big issues that matter to people across the country.”\n\n\nMSNBC is popular with Democrats and left-leaning viewers, and its election and main-evening coverage already includes savvy hosts like Rachel Maddow and Nicolle Wallace.  Now its viewers will receive real-time commentary from a key member of Mr. Biden’s first term inner circle.\nMs. Psaki previously worked as an on-air contributor to CNN.  Prior to that, she served as White House Communications Director for former President Barack Obama and Chief Spokesperson for former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nSource Link",

After breaking down in tears mid-match at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., in March after a heckler rocked her in a second-round loss, she bounced back to reach the final of the Miami Open, where Swiatek beat her, 6-4, 6-0.\nOsaka, who plays for Japan and is based in the United States, remains one of the biggest stars in the sport and the highest paid female athlete in the world by far.  She has enough lucrative long-term endorsement deals to justify recently break up with IMG to set up his own management agency with Stuart Duguid, his agent.\nBut Osaka will be ranked around world No. 40 after Roland Garros, and while his portfolio looks strong in redwood, how does that affect the bottom line and his place in the sporting landscape if a young player like Swiatek takes the real control of the sport and younger, possibly hungrier players like Anisimova continue to dominate Osaka at the start of major tournaments?\nTo what extent, in the age of social media, should results and stardom continue to align once the millions of followers are already acquired?\nOsaka, left ankle wrapped, seemed genuinely determined to change her luck on Monday, digging into the corners and maintaining positive energy almost to the end.  But Anisimova has been more consistent on serve and more devastating from the baseline and, crucially, on the returns.\n\nSource Link",

The Celtics were quicker to drop balls, more active in disrupting passing lanes, and more coordinated in switches, limiting quality looks for Miami.  They were more pressing to get back on defense and turn in the paint, not allowing the Heat to push for quick breaks like they did on Saturday.  Boston’s defense was so effective that Miami only fired two 3-pointers in the first quarter, limiting its chances of closing the deficit until it was too late.  That was exactly the kind of energy Boston was sorely lacking in the first half of Game 3. Miami’s starters combined for 18 points.\nWhat made the game even weirder was that the Celtics didn’t play well offensively.

According to the reasoning, the previous project would result in federal budget losses. \nThe new draft law “On Mining in the Russian Federation”, dated May 20, appeared in the database of the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma.  The document has several significant changes from the previous version, present by the co-sponsors on April 29. \nWhile the text remains unchanged in general, the new draft misses the subsection on a register of mining operators, which companies should register in order to continue their work.  In the latest version, to start mining, crypto mining companies must register as sole proprietor or self-employed.  Companies would follow a standard procedure for company registration. \nRelated: Russia To Include Crypto In Its Tax Code: Here’s What The Rules Could Look Like\nAnother correction swept away the promise of tax amnesty in the first year of registration.

Here’s how Russia is zeroing in on key Ukrainian stronghold Severodonetsk (The Print). And then there is this sobering on the ground report from Euronews on how dire the situation is becoming in eastern Ukraine (see video below). \nIf this is slow and unsuccessful, then why the rush to send tens of billions in arms? Why escalate a greater involvement in this conflict? \nMy gut tells me that the Pentagon leadership are very worried on the military situation that is unfolding right now, and are trying their best to assist the Ukrainians as best as they could to contain the Russian military and their offensive in the Donbas. But will it be enough? I have my doubts.",

Tom Cotton: It’s important that we support the Ukrainians as they defend themselves against this war of aggression by Vladimir Putin. So, first off I do understand the reservations some people had about the legislation. And there was some excessive or unnecessary measures. But a lot of that money went to support our own military and our own troops to replenish the stockpiles of our weapons that those troops need to defend themselves and protect our country. And not just support our allies in Europe but in the Western Pacific, Taiwan in particular. Second, I think it is important that we help the Ukrainians fight their own war. This is much like what Ronald Reagan did in Afghanistan… And finally, I think our main adversary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party is watching very carefully what is happening in Europe. If they see the United States and our allies falter in our resolve to support Ukraine in defending itself against an invasion by Russia, then I think Xi Jinping would believe that there is no way we would come to the aid of Taiwan.  \nAs to what is my take. \nChina is watching closely the West's response to the Russia - Ukraine war. But when it comes to Taiwan Beijing will act according to what is their national security interests, and if they feel threatened they will act irregardless on how the West will respond.",
