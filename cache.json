          "description": "Tokyo will begin recognizing same-sex partnerships from November after revising current rules, officials said Wednesday, becoming the largest city in Japan to do so.\nJapan is the only nation of the Group of Seven countries that does not recognize same-sex unions, and its constitution stipulates that \"marriage shall be only with the mutual consent of both sexes\".\n\nBut in recent years, local authorities across the country have made moves to recognize same-sex partnerships, although such recognition does not carry the same rights as marriage under the law.\n\"We collected opinions from the public for the past two months and we heard opinions (from same-sex couples) who said they want to be recognized as partners,\" a Tokyo government spokesman told AFP.\nThe metropolitan government plans to ask legislators to approve revising a local ordinance next month, and will then begin accepting applications for the certificates in October and issuing them in November.\nThe city is considering offering various services currently only available to married couples to those with the partnership certificate, including applying for city-administered apartments, the spokesman said.\nTokyo's Shibuya district in 2015 became the first place in Japan to begin issuing symbolic \"partnership\" certificates to same-sex couples.\nMany areas have followed suit, with activists saying more than 200 municipalities now recognize same-sex partnerships, granting couples rights including the ability to visit a partner in hospital and rent property together.\nIn a landmark ruling last year, a court in northern Sapporo said Japan's failure to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, a verdict hailed by campaigners as a major victory.\nBut Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been cautious on the possibility of any legislative changes at the national level to recognize same-sex unions.\nTaiwan is currently the only place in Asia with marriage equality, having taken the unprecedented step of legalizing same-sex unions in 2019.\n© 2022 AFP",

Any individual donation under $200 can be made anonymously.\nLuckily for Hines, the Club for Growth Action, the group’s super PAC arm, said it plans to spend $1.3 million support him in the primary.  That’s a huge sum for a house race.\nBefore settling in the 13th arrondissement, Hines had searched for a suitable perch.  He announced plans to challenge Rep. Virginia Foxx, a longtime Republican in the west of the state, before redistricting alters those plans.  In April, he and his wife moved to a house in Fuquay-Varinaa town in southern Wake County, the most densely populated part of the district.\nSome Republicans in the dark red county of Johnston, a fast-growing rural community, criticized Hines for, in the words of the leader of a local group, “Coming in, just trying to pick a district he can win.” And Hines’ main adversary, a lawyer named Kelly Daughtry who is the daughter of a former State House majority leader, attacked him as a baggage handler.\nThe Hines campaign, which declined to make him available for an interview but answered a series of detailed questions about his candidacy, notes his upbringing in Charlotte and his time at NC State, which is in Raleigh, just north of the district line.\nDaughtry has spent more than $2.5 million on the race so far, while contributing nearly $3 million of its own money.  She has also caught in heat for his past donations to Democratsincluding Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic Senate nominee, and Josh Stein, the state attorney general.\nSeveral people with access to private polls said Hines appeared to be ahead of Daughtry by a few percentage points, with everyone else trailing far behind.  In North Carolina, if no candidate wins at least 30% of the vote, the first two qualify for a second round.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "In the cleverly reimagined “Montana Story” genre, the American flag doesn’t just wave and flutter, it also sends a warning.  He looks so modest.  Clean and neat, with no frayed edges or faded colors, it flies from a tall pole planted in front of a beautiful two-story house.  There, on 200 acres in southwestern Montana, in a glorious region surrounded by mountains known as Paradise Valley, nature invites and soothes.  It looks like heaven;  it takes a while to see the rot.\nDirectors Scott McGehee and David Siegel don’t dwell on the flag.  Instead, they gently immerse you in a classic Western setting while simultaneously drawing you into a simmering family melodrama about two grappling adult children and their terminally ill father.

          "description": "As demonstrated in movies as diverse as “Monterey Pop,” “Woodstock” and “Summer of Soul,” music festivals can’t help but derive some of their vibe from their sets.  As witnessed by musicians around the world in the documentary “Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story,” directed by Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern, the city’s annual jazz festival in Louisiana has an unrepeatable flavor as it takes place in the cradle American music.\nThe film’s opening montage, featuring familiar famous faces ranging from Tom Jones to Pitbull, is – thankfully – a bit of a fake.  These big names and others play (and in what some might consider an unfortunate feature, Jimmy Buffett plays a lot) but the film is dutifully attentive to the local eclecticism of the festival.\n\n\nExploring the musical atmosphere of New Orleans itself, the film features experts exposing the distinctions between Cajun and Zydeco, for example.  While both are dance music that trades in old melodies, the latter features electric guitar and washboard and comes at you “like a freight train.”\n\n\nEntrepreneur George Wein, founder of the Newport Jazz Festival, helped create Jazz Fest, wisely assuming musician Ellis Marsalis (you may be familiar with the pianist’s work, or that of his sons, including Wynton and Branford) as a guide to New Orleans.  The organizational work was quickly taken over by young music enthusiast Quint Davis, who is still in charge today.\nThe seething history – which also cites the on-site food tents as a jaw-dropping part of the festival’s appeal – turns to tears when Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans in 2005. But the the music came back like a miracleand the film reports that after a two-year postponement due to Covid-19, the event is currently on the comeback trail.\nJazz Fest: A History of New Orleans\nRated PG-13 for sassy little language.  Duration: 1h34.  In theaters.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Central bankers are hoping their policies will temper economic growth without driving up unemployment or plunging America into a recession – creating what they often call a “soft landing”.\n“I really want this to be the outcome, but I recognize that it won’t be easy to do,” Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview Monday.\nOfficials have clearly recognized that let the economy down gently will be difficult, and some have hinted that they would be willing to inflict economic pain if that was what it took to fight high inflation.\nIf the economy gets to a point where unemployment starts to climb but inflation remains “unacceptably high”, Mr Bostic said, price hikes will be “the threat we have to address”.\nA challenge for policymakers – and even more so for families – is that price increases are surfacing in basic necessities. The cost of food has increased 0.9% in April from the previous month, the 17th consecutive monthly increase, according to Wednesday’s report.\nThe increase was led by dairy products, soft drinks and a 10.3% monthly rise in the cost of eggs as bird flu decimated poultry flocks.  Such inflation tends to particularly affect the poor, who spend more of their budget on necessities such as groceries and gasoline.\nBut while Americans are seeing strong job gains and strong wage growth — although not strong enough to fully counter inflation — many are managing to weather rising costs for now, keeping aggregate demand strong.\n“Consumers seem willing to accept the higher menu prices, especially as inflation runs wide,” George Holm, chief executive of food retailer and restaurant supplier Performance Food Group, said on a call on Wednesday. to the results.  “Nevertheless, it’s something to watch closely over the coming months and quarters.”\nAna Swanson contributed report.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Only two witnesses testified during the trial, both for the prosecution.  Ms Tene, 32, who works in the software industry, spent most of the first day at the bar, describing meeting Mr Batali late one night at Towne Stove and Spirits, a bar in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston which has since closed.\nMr. Batali saw her surreptitiously take a picture of him a few seats away from the bar, then invited her to take pictures with him, she said.  At the start of the photoshoot, she testified, as did the forced kisses and groping.\nThe only other witness called was a friend of Ms Tene, Rachel Buckley, 37.  She said Ms Tene sent her a picture of Mr Batali the night they met, along with texts that described him as looking extremely drunk but didn’t.  I don’t mention that he caught her.  Details of Mr Batali’s groping and kissing emerged in subsequent conversations, Ms Buckley said.\nMuch of the evidence at trial came from two years of text messages from Ms Tene, which sometimes showed she was flippant about selling the photos or getting money from Mr Batali.  They revealed incidents in which she lied to opt out of a gym membership and, in an attempt to avoid jury duty, told another court that she was clairvoyant.  Once she was seated on that jury, she broke court rules by researching the defendant’s background and texting a friend that she thought he was guilty.\nThe judge noted these incidents and her disdain for the courts, as well as photos from the night at the bar that showed her smiling after her first meeting with Mr. Batali.  Three minutes later, she took another round of selfies with the chef.\n“His reaction or lack thereof to the alleged assault is telling,” the judge said.\nJust before giving his decision, Judge Stanton also reprimanded Mr Batali.  “His conduct, appearance and demeanor were not befitting a public figure of his stature at the time,” he said.  “It’s a lesson for all those people in public or celebrity positions.”\n\nSource Link",

Europe needs Russian oil one way or another. \nA prediction. \nThese oil tankers will still pick up Russian oil at Russian sea ports. Make a beeline to a European port with their cargo, and while in transit this oil will be sold and resold and resold (all at a premium) to mask where this oil is coming from and to satisfy insurance requirements. In the end this Russian oil will end up in Europe, albeit at a very high cost for the European consumers. \nThe big winners will be Russian oil companies, the Kremlin, and the Greek/Maltese/etc. shipping oligarchs. \n Greek And Malta Shipowners Succeed In Killing EU’s Russian Oil Tanker Ban   \nProposal to ban EU-tankers transporting Russian oil halted by Greek shipowners -- Greeck City Times  \nBrussels back-tracks on shipping ban for Russian crude after Malta, Greece protests -- Malta  \nEU ditches ban on oil tankers that ship Russian crude to third countries, but keeps restrictions on insurers, report says -- Business Insider",
