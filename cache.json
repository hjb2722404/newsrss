Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing's sovereignty claims are void as the People's Republic of China has never governed the island.\nA Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.\nThe close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Additional reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)",

Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court.\"\nThe lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being \"vicious\", but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.\n\"The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide 'any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions' on the premises,\" said the report. \"It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl.\"\nZoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of \"petting or feeding\" the animals.",

While forward, operators frequently encounter lose / lose situations that the community isn't preparing them to solve.  This increases the risk of mission failure and damage to the reputation of the SOCOM community as a whole.  In part, the problem stems from the difficulty of the situations themselves, but the problem is aggravated by the community's treatment of ethics training as an individual task, when it isn’t.  Ethics training is a collective task, and it requires as much training as any other special operations skill set.  Grey Zone Ethics provides an accessible and realistic solution to this problem. \nDave Maxwell\nThu, 01/05/2023 - 6:34pm\n\nRead more about New Publication: Grey Zone Ethics: A Practitioners Guide to Making Ethically Difficult Decisions\nLog in or register to post comments",

The issue is complex and some parts of the ruling coalition are more ardent than others, according to people familiar with the discussions. \nThe internal tensions reflect the international community’s broader struggle to forge a common position. If Berlin can resolve its own issues, it could provide fresh momentum for discussions in the European Union and put pressure on the US to seize assets, such as central bank reserves, that have been frozen in retaliation over Russia’s invasion.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate 1: Berlin carefully backs Ukrainian demand to use frozen Russian funds (Euractiv)  \nUpdate #2: Germany open to seize Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine — media reports (The New Voice of Ukraine)   \nWNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction.
