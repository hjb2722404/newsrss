These glaciers are composed of salt flows that contain volatile compounds. The exposure of these salt formations resulted from asteroid impacts, providing insights into Mercury's geological history. The salt deposits on Mercury have similarities to salty environments on Earth, raising questions about the potential habitability of subsurface areas. The discovery also offers an explanation for craters with missing chunks, suggesting that impacts exposed and evaporated volatiles. Further investigations are needed to understand the origin of these volatile layers.",

The fossil shows the fungus infecting the ancient plant Asteroxylon mackiei, revealing a predator-prey interaction. The unique reproductive structures of Potteromyces, called conidiophores, distinguish it as a new species. A second specimen confirms its place as one of the oldest ancestors of disease-causing fungi. The findings, published in Nature Communications, highlight the potential of Potteromyces to unlock secrets about fungal evolution using confocal microscopy.",

The discovery, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, completes the understanding of fundamental water masses across the World Ocean. The Atlantic Equatorial Water was identified using data from the Argo program, which consists of self-submerging floats.

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "In this award-winning documentary, we follow the journey of Sarah to find out the painful truth about her family history. When she became a mother, the young Frenchwoman decided to break the silence that surrounded her family's past. Her grandfather was a Harki who fought alongside the French army during the Algerian War. After Algerian independence in 1962, the whole family fled to France. But instead of being welcomed with open arms, the family, like many Harkis, were placed in an internment camp in south-western France. This is where Sarah begins her quest for the truth.",
