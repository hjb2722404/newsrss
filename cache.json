The top Ukrainian diplomat said that the annexations and the recent partial mobilisation in Russia were a \"sign of weakness\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, but added that \"many Russians will die simply because Putin can’t recognise that he is losing this war\".",

          "description": "As any dog owner will attest, dogs can seem eerily attuned to human behavior. When humans yell or pick a fight, dogs often respond with anger and fear. Similarly, people with a sedentary lifestyle may have seemingly sedentary pets: a 2021 study found a correlation between dog obesity and human obesity. \nThis article first appeared in Salon.\n\nNow, a new study sheds light on the peculiar ways that dogs seem to be able to pick up on human vibes. Specifically, researchers found that when you are stressed, your body produces a distinct odor — and our canine friends can smell it.\nThis likely is not a surprise for dog owners. Scientists have already demonstrated that dogs feel love for their owners, lead rich interior lives and can even cry tears of joy. Yet even though scientists know that dogs …",

Many rail workers are also set to strike again on Wednesday, and on other potential dates later in the month.\nThis weekend's walkout coincides with preparations for Sunday's London Marathon, leaving participants struggling to reach the capital, as well as the ruling Conservatives' annual conference in Birmingham also starting Sunday.\nMick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, apologized to people impacted but blamed the government.\n\"The government has brought this dispute on,\" he told the BBC, as he joined other striking staff on picket lines across the country.\n\"They (put) the challenges down to us, to cut our jobs, to cut our pensions and to cut our wages against inflation.\"\nBut Tim Shoveller of Network Rail, which owns and manages Britain's railway infrastructure, described the strikes as a \"huge own goal\" leading to \"less money to spend improving the railway\".\n(AFP)",
