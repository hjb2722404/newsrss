But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "After years of demonizing billionaire investor George Soros as a sinister liberal bogeyman, the Hungarian government and its allied media are taking aim at a fresh target -- his son Alexander.\nMonday's announcement that the elder Soros will hand over control of his philanthropic empire to 37-year-old Alexander, who goes by the name of Alex, prompted an object lesson in the workings of media loyal to nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nThe 92-year-old Soros has become a bête noire of the international far right because of the activities of his Open Society Foundations (OSF).\nIn Hungary, the government accuses him of wanting to \"flood Europe\" with migrants because of the OSF's support for refugee rights advocates.\nCritics of the Hungarian government say it has used anti-Semitic tropes i…",

It was basically China telling the U.S. to \"wise up\". \n3) Economic decoupling was rejected by both sides. \n4) There is a great divide between the two countries on Ukraine, Taiwan, and the West's rule based international order. \n5) No plans for Biden and Xi to meet in the future. \n 6) No Chinese \"apology\" for buzzing US ships and planes in Asia. \n7) U.S. statements by its leaders in the past few months that war is coming against China is another issue that the Chinese are not happy hearing. All that I can say is that if the US wants better relations with China, talking about war is not going to help. \n8) China is asserting its role as an equal to the U.S..",
