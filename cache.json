A Canadian is expected to be among them.\n\nArtemis 3: Moon landing\n\n\n\t\tNASA, for the first time, will land a crewed spacecraft on the southern pole of the Moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.\n\n\n\t\tArtemis 3 is scheduled for 2025 but may not take place until 2026 at the earliest, according to an independent audit of the program.\n\n\nSpaceX Moon lander\n\n\n\t\tSpaceX's Starship, which is still under development, will serve as a shuttle from the Orion crew capsule to the lunar surface and back.\n\nGateway space station\n\n\n\t\tThe launch of the first two elements -- the living quarters module and power and propulsion system -- is planned for late 2024 at the earliest by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\n\n\t\tAstronauts would spend between 30 to 60 days in Gateway and would eventually have access to a lander that would allow them to travel to the Moon and back.\n\nDestination Mars\n\n\t\tThe ultimate objective of the Artemis program is what NASA calls the \"next giant leap -- human exploration of Mars.\"\n\n\n\t\tThe goal is to learn how to maintain a human presence in deep space for a long period.\n\n\n\t\tWhile a trip to the Moon takes just a few days, a voyage to Mars would take a minimum of several months.",

He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words \"war\" and \"invasion\" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.\nRussia says it is conducting a \"special military operation\" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.\nState news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.\nRoizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.\n(Reporting by Reuters; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

Sheriff Boyle lived at Union Street Jail in Northampton and ran the jail.  His deputies signed court summonses and found people on the streets to fill the jury pools.\nThe sheriff also performed ceremonial duties – carrying the mace at Smith College’s debut and leading parades, wearing his top hat, tailcoat and gold waistcoat.  He was the face of the county of Hampshire.\nSince then, our county government has been abolished and the state government has taken control of the courts and correctional services.  The sheriff became just another, albeit important, state employee.  Managing the old county jail and reformatory, overseeing prisoner rehabilitation, serving court proceedings, executing evictions – these are all important jobs.\nThe sheriff is the only official elected by the citizens of the county of Hampshire, and only by the citizens of the county of Hampshire.  It is more important than ever that the Sheriff continues to represent the county of Hampshire at its public events. \nAs far as I know, none of the current sheriff candidates have even mentioned this issue.\nPeter Jones\nFlorence\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {   var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];   if (d.getElementById(id)) return;   js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;   js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=833431040023870\";   fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nSource link",
