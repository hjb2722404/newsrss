          "description": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. – None of the hundreds of fans at a recent Ban Johnson summer college league game felt compelled to jump out of their lawn chairs to cheer when a batter, known by the nickname of DJ, stopped at second base on a fly ball he had snatched from the first base line.  It was a routine play that required DJ, the fastest runner on the team, to suppress his desire to throw a triple in favor of doing what the situation dictated rather than risking a late inning in third.\nBut when this story was passed on to Ray Chang, the coach at DJ High School 7,000 miles away in Nanjing, China, Chang burst with pride.\n“That’s great.

He had sealed two triumphs here, ended his Grand Slam career here, dreamed for decades of being here.\nAnd now, after a tee shot under familiarly granitic Scottish skies, Woods knew it could be over, for good, in minutes.\n\n\nCheers rumbled from the stands, and not just those along No 18, as fiercely as they did when Woods tipped his cap on the Swilcan Bridge minutes after 3 p.m.  He had rubbed his eyes on the promenade, had tilted his cap a little more, and then, finally, the spectators and even the seagulls fell silent.\n\n\nIt w…",
