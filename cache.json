All these he did through direct service, group work and community organisations. His research interests include poverty, housing, and social work. His vision is to enhance the well-being of vulnerable groups.\r \r His primary inspiration for going into research and teaching he says was the church. “Church activities left a large impact on me because I gained self-confidence and bravery while helping others in my church.” He was also heavily influenced by his childhood background. “I come from a low-income family, and in my childhood my family received welfare, but then the church really changed my personal life.

Rapid changes in the geopolitical terrain, along with a drastic transformation in the appeal of the defining elements of democracy and prosperity in the past decade, has made immigration to Western countries less attractive nowadays, but some still hold a perception of Western liberalism as the ultimate goal of immigration.\r \r Regardless of what reasons a person has for deciding to immigrate, some basic challenges presented by the process of immigration and integration into Western host societies include barriers of language, culture, ethnicity, education, recognition of credentials and professional experience, and employment. This does not mean the development and upward mobility of immigrants and their offspring  are hamstrung for good, but empirical research has generally shown that different life trajectories for immigrants and their offspring in Western host societies emerge in the process of assimilation. Some immigrants successfully move to a better-off class—termed the white Protestant middle-class in America by scholars—while many remain in the labouring classes or even urban underclasses, leading a life of poverty and marginalisation.\r \r The picture will be more complicated for the offspring of immigrants. This is because immigrant parents need to overcome the invisible obstacles of intricate educational and social systems to help their children succeed academically and obtain a prestigious college degree as a credential for upward mobility, consonant with what Portes, Fernandez-Kelly, and Haller (2009) mentioned: “(w)ithout the costly and time-consuming achievement of a university degree, such dreams are likely to remain beyond reach” (p. 1081).

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r The past few years have seen huge growth in mobile fitness apps globally. Expecting increased revenue to be generated from this category, app designers strive to add features to enhance the user experience and motivate better performance. \r \r Dr HUANG Guanxiong, Dr Crystal JIANG Li, and doctoral student SUN Mengru from CityU’s Department of Media and Communication surveyed 643 WeRun users to examine the effects of social networking functions of fitness apps on users’ participation in physical activity. WeRun is a fitness plugin embedded in the most widely used mobile social networking app WeChat in China and has accumulated more than 100 million active users. Similar to other fitness apps, WeRun tracks users’ daily step counts and ranks them among WeRun friends. Users can also “like” their friends’ step counts, and the app will notify the users about the “likes” received. \r \r The study focused on the ranking and “liking” functions and linked them to social comparison and social support mechanisms. The survey found that checking WeRun rankings and following more friends on WeRun were positively correlated with participation in physical activity. The social comparison mechanism appeared more dominant than the social support mechanism. Specifically, upward comparison (comparing oneself with those who are more competent in a particular task) was positively associated, and downward comparison (comparing oneself to those who are less competent) was negatively related to physical activity participation. \r \r The more frequently users checked the rankings, the more friends they followed on WeRun and the more upward comparison, leading to more participation in physical activity.  \r \r The study has several implications for motivating physical activity and promoting fitness apps. Fitness app design can benefit from sending more notifications to encourage users to compare their behaviour more often. The design can leverage the positive effects of upward comparison by sending messages like “You are…",

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r Information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as the internet are often thought to have removed the boundaries among countries and brought us to a boundless world. But is that really the case? To investigate this question, research authored by Dr Jun ZHANG, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Asian and International Studies, takes as entry point technological nationalism among middle-class professionals in urban China in the context of the Sino-American trade war of recent years. \r \r Nationalism is a form of identity that is built on—as Benedict Anderson famously argues—an imagined community within a bounded territory. Unlike much existing research, this work does not see ICTs as merely the medium through which nationalism is expressed. Instead, it looks into how ICTs are entangled in people’s everyday lives and how such entanglement shapes “socio-technical imaginaries” of their relationship with their country. Experts may understand ICTs through theories, algorithms and experiments. But when many ordinary people talk about ICTs, they are actually talking about things such as smartphones, and daily practices such as ordering food and hailing a car through online platforms—a way of life that can be called a “platformised lifestyle”.\r \r This research draws on over a decade’s conversations with middle-class professionals and observation of their lifestyles in the urban areas of the Pearl River Delta. It is found that these middle-class professionals are proud of their platformised lifestyle with its unique socio-technological features, high-end smartphones made by Chinese companies, and development in ICTs by tech companies such as Huawei—seemingly advanced enough to alert the American government and thereby leading to Huawei being sanctioned. For many professionals, these achievements suggest that China is moving beyond its sweatshop factory reputation and becoming a rising power in technology. This matters a lot to these professionals.

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r In contemporary US politics, the Democratic Party is often regarded as the most welcoming to racial minority groups. Even so, each election cycle sees many members of these groups cast their vote for the Republican Party. In 2016, for example, Chinese Americans from the East Coast to Silicon Valley organised rallies for Republican candidates. Even though former President of the US, Donald Trump consistently used anti-Asian rhetoric throughout the pandemic, he received an even higher share of votes from Asian Americans in 2020 than in 2016. Why do some Asian Americans support a seemingly anti-minority party? \r \r Although existing research underscores the importance of majority-minority relations to voting behaviour, work done by Dr LIU Dongshu, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Public Policy, and other researchers, proposes a new “minority-minority” perspective. He argues that some Asian Americans feel victimised by pro-minority policies promoted by the Democratic Party as they perceive those policies to only help African Americans and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans. This perceived competition results in Asian Americans supporting the Republican Party, whose policies they perceive to, at least, undermine their competitors from other minority groups. In short, we argue that Asian Americans support the seemingly anti-minority Republicans because they feel more threat from other minority groups.\r \r To assess this, the research team relied on two representative surveys of Asian Americans from 2012 and 2016, along with an experiment Liu and his team conducted in 2018. The surveys find that Asian Americans who perceive themselves to have less in common politically with African and Latino Americans are more likely to support the Republican Party. Experimentally, the team uses affirmative action in university admissions, which many Asian Americans believe to disproportionately favour African and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans, to show that Asian…",

I saw a creature who was indeed old, needed a second chance and deserved to be loved,\" said the proud owner.\nShe said Mr. Happy Face had previously lived with a person who hoarded and conditions were abominable. \"He was a survivor of abuse and neglect,\" she said.\nVets said that with his poor health the dog might only live a few weeks.\n\"Love, kindness and mommy kisses have helped him defy the anticipated short life that we all expected him to have with our family,\" Benally added.\n\"His hobbies include sleeping, snoring, woofing in his sleep and making odd sounds when he is happy.\"\nContest organizers say this of the contest itself: \"Dogs of all breeds and sizes have warmed our hearts and filled our lives with unconditional love. This world-renowned event celebrates the imperfections that make all dogs special and unique.\"",

          "description": "A gunman went on a terrifying rampage in a gay bar and surrounding streets in Oslo on Saturday, killing two people and seriously injuring 10 on the day the city's LGBTQ community was due to celebrate its annual Pride parade.\nThe victims were shot inside and outside the London Pub, a well-known gay bar and nightclub open since 1979, as well as at one other bar in the centre of the Norwegian capital. \"I saw a man arrive with a bag, he picked up a gun and started to shoot,\" said journalist Olav Roenneberg of public broadcaster NRK, who was in the area. \"Then I saw the windows breaking and understood that I had to take cover.\"\nA suspect, a 42-year-old Norwegian citizen of Iranian origin, was detained minutes after, according to police who said they believed he acted alone. Two weapons, including a fully automatic gun, were retrieved from the crime scene, they added.\n\"There is reason to think that this may be a hate crime,\" officers told a news conference. \"We are investigating whether the Pride was a target in itself or whether there are other motives.\" Oslo police spokesman Rune Hekkelstrand told Reuters the attack was also being investigated as a possible act of terrorism.\nNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere decried the shootings as a \"terrible and deeply shocking attack on innocent people\". The suspect was known to authorities, including for violence of a less severe nature, police said.\nThe shooting happened in the early hours of Saturday, and just months after Norway marked 50 years since the abolition of a law that criminalised gay sex. Eleven people also suffered minor injuries, police said.\nOrganisers of Oslo Pride cancelled Saturday's parade, citing police advice. \"We will soon be proud and visible again, but today we will mark Pride celebrations at home,\" they said. Norway, a country of 5.4 million, has lower crime rates than many other Western nations, though it has experienced hate-motivated shootings, including when far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in 2011.\n(REUTERS)",

The Digital Goods Exchange Act, introduced in its latest form in Apriland the law on responsible financial innovation, presented in Juneboth gave the CFTC greater market authority. \nDebbie Stabenow, chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, and senior committee member John Boozman are would have is also drafting a crypto regulation bill, which is expected to expand the powers of the CFTC.

As a black woman who rejects the imposition of the “strong black woman” myth in my life, this sentence is one that has always struck me as an unjust demand that we endure serious harm.  Death, in this framework, is indirectly disentangled from the processes of progressive exhaustion of a person.  There’s an immediacy that underlies the cliché saying that if something doesn’t kill you then, then persevering makes you better.  There’s no room for contempt or anger at the thing that didn’t explicitly kill you because you’re now better off for resisting it. \n\nFor my latest book, “America, Damn: Violence, Black Women, and the Struggle for Justice”, I spent years watching what was slowly and dramatically wagi…",

          "description": "In 2019, many auto experts said Tesla was making a big mistake by deciding to sell cars only online, arguing that whatever bad feelings people had about dealerships were essential to the auto business.\nBut the strategy, which was adopted by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and combines direct sales with a limited number of stores and service centers, appears to prove naysayers wrong.  The company dominates the growing electric car market, even as other manufacturers struggle to sell cars due to a shortage of computer chips.\nTesla’s approach, which has been copied by other young electric car makers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, could eventually have major ramifications for the auto industry.  Most automakers and car dealerships are making big profits right now, as the shortage of new cars ha…",

It does this by raising interest rates, which makes mortgages, auto loans, and business loans more expensive.  As silver becomes more expensive, it weighs on spending and hiring, weakening the job market and the economy in general, perhaps in particular.

          "description": "A new Granite State poll of likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire signals waning support for former President Donald J. Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee — and growing strength for Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida.\nAmong more than 300 likely Republican primary voters, 37% said they wanted Mr. Trump to be the party’s next presidential nominee, compared with 39% who said they would support Mr. DeSantis, within the margin of error of 5.5% for this question.  Mr. Trump is now “statistically linked” to Mr. DeSantis, according to the poll.\nThat’s a significant change from October, when a Granite State poll showed Mr. Trump had the support of 43% of likely Republican voters;  Mr. DeSantis was at 18%.\n\n\nBut Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted the poll, warned there was still plenty of time before the 2024 presidential cycle: “It’s daylight saving time.  We haven’t even had the midterm elections yet.\n\n\nThe tightening between Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis is “part of a typical pattern,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.  “As the primary draws closer, new candidates are emerging and attracting more media attention, and therefore more voter attention, than the losing candidate from the previous election.”\nThe survey was conducted from June 16 to 20.  It also showed that among more than 840 likely voters in the 2024 general election, Mr. DeSantis was a stronger Republican challenger than Mr. Trump to face President Biden in the next presidential election.\nMr. Biden, who won the state in 2020, would get 50% of the vote if he ran against Mr. Trump, who would get 43%, according to the poll.  But Mr. Biden was only expected to get 46% against Mr. DeSantis, who would get 47%, according to the poll.\nIn a brief interview, Mr. Smith described waning support for Mr. Trump as voters “move away from last year’s model to look at this year’s model”.\n\nSource Link",

Our economy has faced a complete collapse,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament on June 22. \n“It is no easy task to revive a country with a completely collapsed economy, especially one that is dangerously low on foreign reserves,” he said.

The grueling conflict has shifted to the eastern provinces, where Russian progress in the Luhansk region has been described as “plodding.” Still, military experts predict that the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk may fall. At the same time, the Ukrainians — increasingly well-equipped, courtesy of the West — talk boldly of reclaiming the southern city of Kherson, which the Russians took early in the conflict. \nAmerican attention has drifted somewhat from the war to domestic concerns, which makes it easy to overlook that what’s unfolding in Ukraine is one of the deadlier conflicts of the past 200 years. That it is a “mere” proxy war, rather than a clash between two great powers, also tends to obscure its scale. But the rate at which soldiers are dying is already significantly higher than in the typical war of the modern era — and both sides are digging in, meaning it will steadily climb the list of conflicts that have caused the most overall fatalities.    \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: A few weeks ago I accepted the depressing fact that this war is going to last a minimum of two years.
