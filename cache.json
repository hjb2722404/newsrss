          "description": "TikTok’s design makes it a breeding ground for misinformation, the researchers found.  They wrote that the videos could easily be manipulated and reposted on the platform and featured alongside stolen or original content.  Pseudonyms are common;  parody and comedy videos are easily misinterpreted as fact;  popularity affects the visibility of comments;  and the data about posting time and other details are not clearly displayed on the mobile app.\n(Shorenstein Center researchers noted, however, that TikTok is less vulnerable to so-called brigadier, in which groups coordinate to spread a message widely, than platforms like Twitter or Facebook.)\nIn the first quarter of 2022, more than 60% of videos containing harmful misinformation were viewed by users before being deleted, TikTok said.  Last year, a group of behavioral scientists who had worked with TikTok said an effort to attach warnings to posts with unsubstantiated content reduced sharing by 24% but limited views by just 5%.\nThe researchers said misinformation will continue to thrive on TikTok as long as the platform refuses to disclose data about the origins of its videos or share information about its algorithms.  Last month, TikTok said it would offer access to a version of its application programming interface, or API, this year, but it didn’t say whether it would do so until the midterms.\nFilippo Menczer, professor of computer science and computer science and director of the Indiana University Social Media Observatory, said he had offered research collaborations to TikTok and had been told ” Absolutely not”.\n“At least with Facebook and Twitter, there is some level of transparency, but, in the case of TikTok, we have no idea,” he said.  “Without resources, without being able to access the data, we don’t know who is suspended, what content is removed, if it acts on reports or what the criteria are.  It’s completely opaque and we can’t independently assess anything.\n\nSource Link",

The world may be facing energy and climate crises, Mr Souki told The New York Times, “but one is going to happen this month, and the other is 40 years from now.”\n\n\n“If you tell someone, ‘You’re going to run out of power this month,’ and then you tell the same person about what’s going to happen 40 years from now,” he said, “they say, ‘What do you care about in 40 years?’  »\n\n\n\nAdditional production for The Sunday Read was contributed by Emma Kehlbeck, Parin Behrooz, Anna Diamond, Sarah Diamond, Jack D’Isidoro, Elena Hecht, Desiree Ibekwe, Tanya Pérez, Marion Lozano, Naomi Noury, Krish Seenivasan, Corey Schreppel, Margaret Willison, Kate Winslett and Tiana Young.

          "description": "SAN FRANCISCO — Nancy Pelosi has made two very different, almost irreconcilable statements about her political future.\nIn 2018, she promised that 2022 would be her last year as House Democratic leader, access a term limit to quell an uprising and secure a second term as president.  In January, she announced she was running for another two-year term in the House.\nWith the House passing the sweeping measure to tackle climate change and prescription drug prices on Friday — “a glorious day for us,” Ms Pelosi rejoiced — and her China-defying trip to Taiwan serving cornerstone of her diplomatic career, the question of what comes next for Ms Pelosi is only intensifying.\n\n\nWill she push to stay on as president if Democrats somehow hold the House?  Or, if the Republicans take control, will she simp…",

The aroma of roasting beans filled the small shop in this seaside town, where the worker, Marie-France Kozoro, prepared the next batch for her journey to chocolate.\nNearly six million people depend on the cocoa industry in the West African nation of Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s largest cocoa producer.

And when I was on the road, pandemic restrictions and simple common sense meant my meals were, by definition, take-out.\n\n\nWhile the pandemic is ongoing, I have resumed eating carefully in restaurants.  And, in particular, I started looking again for restaurants that are as much local institutions as places to grab a bite to eat.\n\n\nMost of them, perhaps all of them, will never attract the attention of Michelin Guide critics.  Their decor is generally modest, as are their prices.

The flowers that a family had brought were beginning to wilt.  The babies were crying.  The crowd was huddled in the shade, greetings and laughter alternating with silence, their excitement cut by the tension.\nBy the clock, the prison authorities were running late.  But Khaled Dawoud, a former detainee, was used to their ways.  By Egyptian standards, he joked, a three-hour delay to see his former cellmate and five other political prisoners released was nothing.\n\n\n“My heart goes like,” Mr Dawoud said, clapping his hand to his chest.
