Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.\n\"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller,\" said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.\nTheatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as \"art-therapy\", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.\nIevhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.\n\"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun',\" he said. \"There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good.\"\n(Reporting by Umit Bektas; Writing by Andrii Pryimachenko and Alex Richardson; Editing by Alison Williams)",

But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.\n“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”\nThe Vél d’Hiv roundup –…",

He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words \"war\" and \"invasion\" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.\nRussia says it is conducting a \"special military operation\" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.\nState news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.\nRoizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.\n(Reporting by Reuters; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

          "description": "(Reuters) - At least 15 people died and 50 more were wounded on Wednesday when Russian forces launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian railway station, said President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nIn a video address to the United Nations, Zelenskiy said the rockets had hit a train in the town of Chaplyne, some 145 km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Four carriages were on fire, he said.\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Chris Reese)",

Photos were altered by artificial intelligence, and hashtag operations using pro-US propaganda were all used to undermine the Russian government.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Feds arrest members of militia allegedly run by former House GOP candidate in Jan. 6-related case\nVice News also noted that the report showed tech companies were willing to take action against propaganda, even if it was by the United States. It just took them five years to do it.\n\nThe \"joint investigation found an interconnected web of accounts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and five other social media platforms that used deceptive tactics to promote pro-Western narratives in the Middle East and Central Asia.”",

The relentless shelling of Ukrainian industrial sites has released poisonous substances, polluting the country’s soils and rivers and threatening its rich biodiversity. With most of Ukraine’s nature reserves located in conflict zones, activists warn that the extent of the damage is yet to be discovered.\nPictures of burned-out Russian tanks lying abandoned along Ukraine’s roads and tracks have become a familiar sight after six months of devastating war between the two neighbors. Less well known is the environmental cost of the more than 5,000 such military wrecks that Moscow’s forces have lost so far, according to a US intelligence tally. \n“Russian tanks can carry betwe…",

Many expect blockchain power consumption to drop precipitously, scalability to improve, and the network to be less vulnerable to attack.\nIt is unclear how crypto users might respond to a forked PoW token listed on Coinbase or any crypto exchange during Ethereum transitions.  Wednesday, the platform launched an ERC-20 token which will allow customers to use staked ETH while earning rewards, cbETH.\nRelated: The quadruple bug bounty for the Ethereum network – Up to $1 million in payouts before the merger\nBinance too said On Thursday, it might offer support for new tokens created by a potential hard fork but would “guarantee no listings” without a review process.  BitMEX made a similar announcement on August 8, adding that the offer was “highly speculative” and “may never exist”.\n\n\n\nSource Link",

Given how long it takes to build modern naval warships, the U.S. needs to start building now if it is to have the fleet it will need to deter Chinese aggression. \nLast year, Navy Adm. Phil Davidson, the former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, cautioned Congress that China is preparing to move against Taiwan by 2027. That assessment is shared by the current Indo-Pacific commander, the current CIA director, and Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state and ex-CIA director. \nWhy 2027? Eyeing negative economic and demographic trends, and the regional military balance, Chinese leaders worry that the odds they’ll be able to achieve their long-held goal of conquering Taiwan will fade with each passing year after that.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: I do not see the military balance shifting back to the U.S. after 2027.

Times: Six months of war in Ukraine — and it's only growing more dangerous \nFar from bogging down in a stalemate, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has evolved into an increasingly dangerous conflict as it passes the six-month mark, with fighting around Europe's largest nuclear plant, a high-profile assassination in Moscow, escalating threats and daring Ukrainian attacks in Russian-held territory.\n\"The dynamic of the battlefield\" is shifting, said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of U.S. Army Europe. Armed with increasingly lethal weapons from the U.S. and other allies, Ukraine has been able to occasionally seize the initiative and surprise Russian forces. \nIt is not clear, however, how long that can last or whether Ukraine can build on those small victories enough to dictate the course of the war.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I am focused on the massive battles that are now occurring in the Donbas.
