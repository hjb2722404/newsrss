The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Rather than using scarce and expensive antiaircraft missiles and guns to shoot down a drone that may cost only a few hundred dollars, it's easier to disrupt the link between the drone and its operator, causing it to crash.\n\n \nRead more .... \nUS Army Scrambles To Boost Electronic Warfare Readiness \n20 Years Behind, US Army To Up Its EW Capability As Russia Takes A Massive Lead In Electronic Warfare -- EurAsian Times\n \nUS Scrambles To Boost Electronic Warfare Readiness As Russia-Ukraine Drone Jamming Raises Concerns -- Benzinga \nUkraine war driving US Army electronic warfare development, Bush says -- C4ISRNET",
