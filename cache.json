But amid a cold snap and gas shortages, the population has been paralysed by sub-zero temperatures in many regions around the country. These gas shortages have not only led to widespread power cuts, but also severe air pollution from burning low-grade heavy fuel oil, known as mazut, to make up the difference. Despite denials from authorities, the FRANCE 24 Observers team found evidence that this fuel oil is partially responsible for the “unbreathable” air in some Iranian cities.",

          "description": "For weeks, Iran has been hit by cold weather. In a country where most households rely on natural gas for heating and hot water, gas shortages in many regions have paralysed the population, leaving people in sub-zero temperatures. In some regions, schools and public facilities have even been closed. The gas shortage itself has led to widespread power outages in several cities, an increase in air pollution and even more protests, on top of the anti-regime protests that have been wracking Iran since September 2022.",

President Joe Biden announced the transfer of 31 Abrams to thwart an anticipated Russian spring offensive and galvanize European allies. \nFighting this winter has been described by a senior U.S. military official as \"savage,\" likening it to World War I trench warfare. \nAnalysts expect Russia to mount what could be a fierce offensive in a campaign to end Ukraine’s string of battlefield successes in recent months and reverse the heavy troop and territorial losses Russia suffered in the first year of fighting. \nSince the war began, the White House and Pentagon have sought to supply Ukraine with the weapons it needs to resist President Vladimir Putin's aggression without sparking a wider war in Europe. Yet Biden's announcement Wednesday also signals that the war, launched with a militarily unprovoked invasion and soon to enter its second year, shows no sign of ending.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: For someone who says he wants to avoid a wider war, this will only escalate it further.",

But fortunately for the Hungarian people, who voted decisively for Orban in elections last year because of his views on the war, the Hungarian leadership understand the risks and potential disaster if a policy of involvement is followed, and are choosing to stay out of it.",

          "description": "BBC: US and Germany ready to send tanks to Ukraine - reports \nAfter months of reluctance, the US and Germany reportedly plan to send tanks to Ukraine, in what Kyiv hopes will be a game-changer on the battlefield.  US President Joe Biden's administration is expected to announce plans to send at least 30 M1 Abrams tanks. \nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also reportedly decided to send at least 14 Leopard 2 tanks. \nRussia's ambassador to the US blasted the news as \"another blatant provocation\". \nUkrainian officials have said such shipments could help its forces seize back territory from the Russians. \nUntil now, the US and Germany have resisted internal and external pressure to send their tanks to Ukraine.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The last time German tanks were used in this part of the world it ended very badly for Europe as a whole. My cousin in Moscow called these reports of the US and Germany planning to send tanks to Ukraine \"Operation Barbarasso 2\". \nSighhh .... Russians are about to see German tanks gunning for them over the horizon. Westerners have no idea on what passions this will raise in Russia. \nThis is really bad. Everyone I know in Russia is now convinced that NATO is about to engage in a hot war with Russia. \nI have also been told that Moscow bluntly told Germany that this crosses a red-line. That once German Leopard tanks are engaged against Russian forces, President Putin will announce a General Mobilization. He will state that this deployment has broken treaties with Russia on the use and deployment of German military assets, and Russia must respond. \nGermany To Send Leopard 2 Tanks To Ukraine   \nGermany to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine — reports -- DW  \nU.S., Germany poised to send tanks to Ukraine, answering Kyiv's pleas -- Reuters  \nGermany set to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, Der Spiegel reports -- CNN  \nGermany moves to send battle tanks to Ukraine -- Politico  \nGermany, US agree to send battle tanks to Ukraine: Reports -- Al Jazeera",

It’s still unclear how much Finland will shift its approach. \nThe stance remains for the two countries to enter NATO simultaneously, given security considerations, Haavisto told reporters in Helsinki on Tuesday, softening comments from earlier in the day, when he’d said Finland may need to prepare going it alone. \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Finland’s top diplomat hints at joining NATO without Sweden (AP)  \nUpdate #2: Finland may need to join NATO without Sweden, foreign minister says    \nWNU editor: I agree with the Finnish foreign minister that a time-out is needed ....
