The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne avoided parliamentary censure in an early morning vote on Saturday after she forced the government's budget plan through the National Assembly without a vote. \nThe motion to censure Borne – the 18th levelled at her since she assumed the office – was brought by the left-wing Nupes alliance after the prime minister activated Article 49.3 to adopt the public finance bill without a vote.\nThe motion received just 193 of the 289 votes needed to succeed, an unsurprising outcome in light of the lack of support from the centre-right.\nIts rejection constitutes the adoption of the 2023-2027 budget program, which now moves to the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament.\nThe speaker for Nupes, socialist Philippe Brun, accused the government of \"favouring with the greatest servility a very well-endowed minority of the French\" despite \"an immense inflationary crisis\".\nPresident Emmanuel Macron had \"tried to make parliament disappear with his repeated (use of) 49.3\", Brun added.\nThe far right had supported the left's motion of censure, accusing Borne of the \"repeated and abusive use of 49.3\".\nBorne, for her part, hit back at both factions, saying \"demagoguery is your only budgetary course\".\nThe government also resorted to Article 49.3 earlier this year to push through unpopular pension reforms, sparking violent protests.\n(AFP)",

She was also the team's long-time head coach.\nShe had denied claims of psychological abuse, saying the accusations came from disgruntled gymnasts who were not selected for Olympic squads.\nParents of gymnasts training at the national centre in Desio wrote a letter to the head of Italy's Olympic Committee in support of the 57-year-old, who has won a raft of medals for Italy since taking charge in 1996.\n© 2023 AFP",

Their overall Ratings are down 30%,\" he added. \"FOX NEEDS MAGA, THEY JUST DON’T KNOW IT YET. STOP WITH THE BAD DEBATES & NEGATIVE ADS, NO MORE. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE! DJT.\"",

          "description": "Six female migrants trapped inside a refrigerated food truck were rescued by French police after one of the women made a distress call to a reporter, the BBC and French authorities said Thursday.\nThe women — four Vietnamese and two Iraqis — hid for hours in a truck loaded with boxes of bananas in northern France, believing the vehicle was on its way to the U.K. or Ireland.\nWhen they realized that the truck was going the opposite way, they started to panic in the cold and cramped, dark space. One of them managed to reach a BBC reporter in London, who then helped the women alert French police Wednesday.\nFrench prosecutor Laetitia Francart said the truck driver, who was in fact heading for Italy, was not at fault. The women told investigators that the driver wasn’t involved, “saying that they…",

          "description": "Twin shootings in Rotterdam on Thursday have resulted in an unknown number of fatalities, police said.\nA gunman dressed in combat gear opened fire in a flat in the Dutch city then burst into a nearby medical centre. Fires broke out in both places but were later extinguished.\n“The two shooting incidents in Rotterdam have resulted in fatalities. We will first inform family and relatives and will explain more later,” the city police said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\nElite police units had burst into the hospital in the Dutch city searching for the suspect, who was armed with a handgun, authorities said.\nThe suspect is 32 and the motive for the attack is unknown, local news agency ANP said, citing police. He is suspected of carrying out both shootings and there is not a second shooter, police said.\nPictures from the scene showed people streaming out of the hospital, including medics and patients, as police in body armour moved in. Police helicopters buzzed overhead.\nMedics in white coats wheeled patients out on stretchers and wheelchairs\nPolice had earlier said the suspect was wearing “combat-style” clothes, was tall, with black hair and carrying a backpack.\n“First there was a shooting on the fourth floor. Four or five shots were fired. Then a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the education centre,” said a medical student cited by RTL Nieuws, who did not give his name.\n“There was a lot of panic and screaming... I didn’t hear any shots, just the panic and that’s what I started to act on,” public broadcaster NOS cited another eyewitness as saying.\nRotterdam is often the scene of shootings, usually attributed to score settling by rival drug gangs.\nAuthorities were expected to hold a news conference shortly to give more details.\nIn 2019, three people were shot dead on a tram in Utrecht, sparking a huge manhunt.\nAnd in 2011, the country was left shocked when 24-year Tristan van der Vlis killed six people and wounded 10 others in a rampage at a packed shopping mall.\n(AFP)",

He was 82.\nA statement by his family, issued by his publicist, said he died following “a bout of pneumonia.”\n“We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside,” his family said.\nNo matter what role he took on in a career that lasted more than five decades, Gambon was always instantly recognizable by the deep and drawling tones of his voice.

Thus far, it has been used by more than 10,000 Ukrainian servicemen who were subsequently taken into Russian custody, according to a source with knowledge of the situation cited by TASS. The person added that the radio frequency is active along the entire front line. \nRead more .... \nUpdate #1: Over 10,000 Ukrainian fighters surrender since summer using special radio frequency (TASS). \nUpdate #2: The source named the number of people who used the open frequency 149.200 “Volga” to surrender military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Top War) \nWNU Editor: Ukraine is also claiming the same thing. Aside from paying people to defect .... Ukraine pays USD 500,000 to Russian pilot who surrendered with Mi-8 helicopter (Euromaidan), Kyiv is also making the claim that Russian soldiers are surrendering .... Over 200 Russian soldiers surrender to Ukraine thanks to \"I Want to Live\" project (Ukrinform). \nI am always skeptical of these reports. But what I do find is disturbing is a large discrepancy in the number of POWs that both sides claim to have. On the Russian sides I understand there are thousands of POWs currently in detention. On the Ukraine side the number is only a few hundred.",

This year, No one  \nThe front line in Ukraine changed little in the winter. Russia aimed to capture the entirety of the Donbas, but it only inched forward. \nUkraine has made minimal gains in its counteroffensive. Dense Russian minefields and fortifications have made every attack extremely costly. \nDespite nine months of bloody fighting, less than 500 square miles of territory have changed hands since the start of the year. A prolonged stalemate could weaken Western support for Ukraine. \nBoth sides started the year with lofty ambitions: Russia wanted to capture the eastern Donbas region, while Ukraine aimed to split Russian forces with an attack in the south. \nNeither offensive has gone to plan.
