          "description": "British electronic music pioneers Depeche Mode announced a comeback on Tuesday with an upcoming new album and their first tour in more than five years, following the death of founding member Andrew Fletcher.\nLead singer Dave Gahan said the new record Memento Mori, due out in March, was inspired both by the pandemic and the loss of Fletcher, who died in May from a tear in his heart artery.\nGahan, 60, told reporters in the German capital that the band, after a long absence, was ready to embrace its fans again with a series of big stadium shows also beginning in March, in Sacramento.\n\"We get to make music and we get to play music for you and hopefully bring a sense of joy and togetherness, you know, in our own small way, in a world that seems to be constantly in some kind of turmoil,\" he said of their 19th tour.\nThe band, one of Britain's most successful and long-running acts, had tantalised fans last week with a cryptic teaser on Instagram showing only grainy footage of a music mixing console and the words \"Berlin 4.10.22\".\nCredited with bringing electronic music into the mainstream, the band last released a studio album, \"Spirit\", in 2017. \"Memento Mori\" will be their 15th studio record.\nDepeche Mode triumphed with a string of hits in the 1980s and early 1990s, at first becoming synonymous with danceable synthpop but then gradually adopting a darker sound.\nThe band has sold more than 100 million albums since it began in 1980, winning over a global audience with earworms such as \"Personal Jesus\", \"People Are People\" and \"Enjoy the Silence\".\nThe group has nevertheless maintained an underground appeal, even as it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.\n© 2022 AFP",

As a result, I'm announcing we are not proceeding with the abolition of the ... rate.\n\"We get it, and we have listened.\"\nThe announcement also came after former cabinet ministers Grant Shapps and Michael Gove voiced opposition over unfunded tax cuts unveiled by Kwarteng in his controversial mini-budget on September 23.\nKwarteng had proposed to remove the 45-percent rate applied to Britons earning more than £150,000 ($167,400) per year.\nThe so-called mini budget had sent the pound plunging to a record dollar low and sent bond yields spiking on fears of a borrowing splurge.\nThe budget included a costly freeze on energy bills for individuals and businesses, in an attempt to cushion fallout from key gas producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n(AFP)",

Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.\nLula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.\n\nWith 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:\n\nWith 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:\n\n\nLula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.\nTo win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.\nPolls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.\nOfficial results can be found here: latest Brazil Election Results",

The EU countries will have to face the truth and admit that they were betrayed by their allies in the situation involving the Nord Stream incidents, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel on Wednesday. \nShe drew attention to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak’s statement that Russia was ready to supply gas through the undamaged Nord Stream 2 pipeline string.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: The above weekly Russian Foreign Ministry briefing begins at 1:07:35.. English translation available.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova's remarks reminds me of what a very good friend of mine told me once. People never learn until it hits their pocket-books. \nFor Russia, these pipelines represent years of planning and work, $23 billion to build, and the expectation of almost a trillion dollars in revenues to Russia over the lifetime of this pipeline that is now lost forever. \nFor Europe the loss and cost is even greater. Energy shortages. The astronomical cost to replace this energy. Economic dislocation/dis-industrialization. High inflation and a debt explosion that will cripple the budgets of governments/businesses/families. A social cost that is currently incalculable. \nBottom line. \nThis attack is easily going to cost Europe hundreds of billions of dollars, if not a trillion. \nSo yes. The state actor(s) that did this, and the entire world outside of Canada and the U.S. know who that is, has betrayed the EU.",

Leading this discussion were those in the arts/culture/music/etc. (just like in eastern Europe at the same time). Hollywood is not the only cultural institution in the world that has a profound influence on it social and political culture. This is actually the case for must countries, and Xi obviously learned that lesson at a very young age when he saw what what was happening around him during that time. On a side note.
