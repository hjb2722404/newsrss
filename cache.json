          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r The Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study (HKIAS) at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) continues to connect scholars around the globe, allowing them to explore interdisciplinary ideas and address real-world issues. \r \r The most recent HKIAS Distinguished Lecture Series on Electronics and Photonics, held in March and April, was  supported in part by Kwang Hua Educational Foundation. The discussion topics covered nanotechnology, antenna design, 6G networks and much more, with five leading scientists outlining the latest research and potential applications of breakthrough technologies. The series attracted an international audience of over 2,000 scholars and guests. \r  \r \r The power of plasmonic biosensors\r \r \r \r Nanotechnology and its biosensor applications are becoming ever more prevalent in the field of biomedical microsystems. \r \r Kicking things off on March 1, Professor Stella W. Pang, Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Director of the Centre for Biosystems, Neuroscience, and Nanotechnology at CityU, spoke about “Nanotechnology for High-Performance Devices and Sensors”.   \r \r Noting the increased use of plasmonic sensors, she explained the ability of nanoimprint technology “to generate a large area of nanostructures within a few seconds”, showing high reproducibility and throughput. The novel 3D multiple layer plasmonic biosensors exhibit enhanced electric fields and a much higher sensitivity. This made it possible to detect lung cancer A549 live cells and nanoscale DNAs at very low concentrations by monitoring the highly sensitive resonance peak shift. \r \r Also, hybrid coupling of plasmonic and photonic crystal modes leads to a record high sensitivity of 1376 nm/refractive index unit. “Combining these biosensors with 3D engineered platforms, we can separate cancer cells from normal cells for identification, which will further improve the sensitivity such that cancer patients could be diagnosed at a much earlier stage, potentially saving millions of lives,”…",

It is one of the largest remaining undeveloped parcels of land in the area. \nZiegler, who died in 1905, bought it around 1900 to use as a summer residence.\n“There will never again be an opportunity for the city to control the fate of this property, or add an asset to all of us like this,” Darien First Selectman Monica McNally said at an April meeting of the City Board of Selec…",

Bank strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was the main author of this document.\nA note from bank investors placed the fair value of bitcoin at the same level in February.  It was trading around $43,000 at the time.\nCrypto has outmoded real estate as the preferred “alternative asset” of the bank, along with hedge funds, continues the note.  This mentioned:\n\n“So far, there is little evidence of VC [venture capital] funding dries up after Terra’s collapse.  Of the $25 billion in VC funding year-to-date, nearly $4 billion has come after Terra.  Our best guess is that venture capital funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018/2019 would be avoided.\n\nVenture capital funding would be key to avoiding this crypto winter, he added.\nOn the same day, the great venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its fourth cryptocurrency fund at $4.5 billion.  Also on Wednesday, crypto-focused venture capital firm NGC Ventures launched its third blockchain fund with $100 million raised from investors such as Babel Finance, Huobi Ventures and Nexo Ventures.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly said expressed his personal antipathy to cryptocurrency, going so far as to call it a fraud, but the bank itself has taken a more practical stance.  This becomes the first major bankin the Metaverse earlier this year.  Dimon praised crypto for its ease of cross-border payment.\n\nSource Link",

She won his first Tony Award for this performance.\n\n\nShe starred in several Sondheim musicals, winning Tony Awards for playing the theater’s most famous stage mother, Momma Rose, in “Gypsy,” as well as the scheming pastry chef owner Mrs. Lovett in ” Sweeney Todd”.  His most recent Tony nomination, in 2010, was for his work in a revival of another Sondheim musical, “A little night music.”\nLansbury also won Tony Awards for a short-lived musical titled “Dear World” and a revival of Noël Coward’s play “joyful spirit.”\nHer last Broadway appearance was in a 2012 revival of “The best man», a play by Gore Vidal.\nLansbury also had a long career in film – she memorably voiced Mrs. Potts in ‘Beauty and the Beast’ – and in television, where she was the longtime star of ‘Murder, She Wrote’.\nThe Tony Awards are set to begin June 12 at 7 p.m. EST with an hour-long segment airing on Paramount+ hosted by Darren Criss and Julianne Hough, followed at 8 p.m. EST by a three-hour segment aired on CBS hosted by Ariana DeBose.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "One night in May 1997, in Tacoma, Washington, Kimonti Carter machine-gunned a car he believed to be carrying rival gang members.  It wasn’t – not that it should matter.  One of the five passengers in the car, a student, Corey Pittman, 19, was killed.  Carter, who had just turned 18, was sentenced to life in prison.\nIn director Gilda Sheppard’s sympathetic documentary “Since I Been Down”, punishment is also a crime.\nFilled with archival visuals of Tacoma in the late 1980s and 1990s, when crack cocaine and gang violence took their toll, the documentary’s greatest strength is its listening tour, with Carter as the main guide.\n\n\nBecause Carter fired from a car, he was charged with aggravated first-degree murder, which carries an automatic mandatory life sentence.  (His reconviction hearing is scheduled for July 8.) He is not the only one facing harsh prison terms.  Washington state’s three-stroke sentence (which abolished parole in 1984) can be particularly difficult for young offenders.\n\n\nOver the decades, Carter expressed remorse, but it was his role as a beneficiary and leader of inmate-led initiatives, the Black Prisoner Collective and TEACH, or Taking Education and Changing History, that suggests a transformation.\nOther inmates here share their insights, as do two former detectives, some former gang members, and the mothers of victims and perpetrators.  One former inmate, Tonya Wilson, who served 17 years, is particularly insightful about the personal and societal forces that led to her incarceration.\nAnother prisoner said, “We say that a lot of the answers that people are looking for in society will be found in prison.\n“We caused pain,” said this inmate, “mainly because we are in pain.”\nFar from looking like an excuse, in “Since I Been Down”, this observation sounds like a way to take account and change.\nSince I’ve been down\nUnclassified.

Ms Psaki said at the time that she adhered to ethical guidelines while discussing future job prospects.\nShe is the second major hire by MSNBC from the Biden administration. Symone D. Sanders, a former spokeswoman for Vice President Kamala Harris, hosts a weekend show for the network.  Ms. Psaki said in a statement provided by MSNBC that her program would focus on “factual, thoughtful conversations about the big issues that matter to people across the country.”\n\n\nMSNBC is popular with Democrats and left-leaning viewers, and its election and main-evening coverage already includes savvy hosts like Rachel Maddow and Nicolle Wallace.  Now its viewers will receive real-time commentary from a key member of Mr. Biden’s first term inner circle.\nMs. Psaki previously worked as an on-air contributor to CNN.  Prior to that, she served as White House Communications Director for former President Barack Obama and Chief Spokesperson for former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nSource Link",

They sneak into dumpsites near human settlements at the edge of their forest habitats and quickly gobble up trash – plastic utensils, wrappers and all.  But their guilty pleasure for fast food is traveling with them – elephants carry plastic and other human waste deep into the forests of parts of India.\n“When they defecate, the plastic comes out of the feces and settles in the forest,” said Gitanjali Katlam, an ecology researcher in India.\nWhile much research has been conducted on the spread of plastics from human pollution in the world’s oceans and seas, much less is known about how this waste moves with terrestrial wildlife.

It lacks an Earth-thick mantle, and no one really knows why. A possibility is that the planet was much larger – perhaps twice its current mass or more.

In 2020, he writes an article in Quillettean online newspaper, which criticized anti-racist proposals by Princeton faculty, students and staff.\nThe university’s statement on the dismissal didn’t even allude to the issue of free speech.

          "description": "In less than a month, the crypto mining bill in the Russian parliament lost several key points, such as the obligation for mining operators to register in a special register and a one-year tax amnesty for all those who registered.  According to the reasoning, the previous project would result in federal budget losses. \nThe new draft law “On Mining in the Russian Federation”, dated May 20, appeared in the database of the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma.  The document has several significant changes from the previous version, present by the co-sponsors on April 29. \nWhile the text remains unchanged in general, the new draft misses the subsection on a register of mining operators, which companies should register in order to continue their work.  In the latest version, to start mining, crypto mining companies must register as sole proprietor or self-employed.  Companies would follow a standard procedure for company registration. \nRelated: Russia To Include Crypto In Its Tax Code: Here’s What The Rules Could Look Like\nAnother correction swept away the promise of tax amnesty in the first year of registration.  The grace period would apply to the clearance of mining equipment, any profits made before the law was passed, and any violations of strict limits on money transfers abroad adopted by the Russian government on March 8. .  local media, in its review of the project, the legal department of the State Duma critical registration and tax amnesty initiatives, stating that they could “eventually incur costs on the federal budget”.\nOn April 7, the head of the State Duma’s Financial Markets Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, revealed that changes to the federal tax code regarding crypto should be adopted. by the end of summer parliamentary session.  It is unclear if they would include specifications regarding mining.\n\nSource Link",
