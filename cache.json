A Canadian is expected to be among them.\n\nArtemis 3: Moon landing\n\n\n\t\tNASA, for the first time, will land a crewed spacecraft on the southern pole of the Moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.\n\n\n\t\tArtemis 3 is scheduled for 2025 but may not take place until 2026 at the earliest, according to an independent audit of the program.\n\n\nSpaceX Moon lander\n\n\n\t\tSpaceX's Starship, which is still under development, will serve as a shuttle from the Orion crew capsule to the lunar surface and back.\n\nGateway space station\n\n\n\t\tThe launch of the first two elements -- the living quarters module and power and propulsion system -- is planned for late 2024 at the earliest by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\n\n\t\tAstronauts would spend between 30 to 60 days in Gateway and would eventually have access to a lander that would allow them to travel to the Moon and back.\n\nDestination Mars\n\n\t\tThe ultimate objective of the Artemis program is what NASA calls the \"next giant leap -- human exploration of Mars.\"\n\n\n\t\tThe goal is to learn how to maintain a human presence in deep space for a long period.\n\n\n\t\tWhile a trip to the Moon takes just a few days, a voyage to Mars would take a minimum of several months.",

But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.\n“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”\nThe Vél d’Hiv roundup –…",

He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words \"war\" and \"invasion\" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.\nRussia says it is conducting a \"special military operation\" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.\nState news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.\nRoizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.\n(Reporting by Reuters; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

          "description": "KYIV (Reuters) -The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law.\nRussia's defense ministry said on Thursday its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.\n\"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine,\" Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.\n\"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families.\"\nBrown said the human toll of the attack was \"just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine.\"\nShe cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.\n\"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Catherine Evans and Richard Chang)",

Sheriff Boyle lived at Union Street Jail in Northampton and ran the jail.  His deputies signed court summonses and found people on the streets to fill the jury pools.\nThe sheriff also performed ceremonial duties – carrying the mace at Smith College’s debut and leading parades, wearing his top hat, tailcoat and gold waistcoat.  He was the face of the county of Hampshire.\nSince then, our county government has been abolished and the state government has taken control of the courts and correctional services.  The sheriff became just another, albeit important, state employee.  Managing the old county jail and reformatory, overseeing prisoner rehabilitation, serving court proceedings, executing evictions – these are all important jobs.\nThe sheriff is the only official elected by the citizens of the county of Hampshire, and only by the citizens of the county of Hampshire.  It is more important than ever that the Sheriff continues to represent the county of Hampshire at its public events. \nAs far as I know, none of the current sheriff candidates have even mentioned this issue.\nPeter Jones\nFlorence\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {   var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];   if (d.getElementById(id)) return;   js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;   js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=833431040023870\";   fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nSource link",

Many still held their racist beliefs, but they were shrouded in politics and toned down to hate speech.  Those who openly held such prejudiced racial views were considered outliers to the fiscally responsible right.\n\nBut there came a time when everything changed, and the party of “less federal government involvement” became the party of “big racism.”  According to a 2020 interview with Mother Jones. \n\nStevens noted that if the Republican Party did not want…",

          "description": "Odessa Jornal: Turkey, for the first time in 39 years, will raise the fee for passage through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Five times more \nTurkey will five times increase the cost of passage through the Black Sea Straits in October, the Sabah newspaper reports, citing sources in the Turkish Ministry of Transport. \nThe increase in fees for the lighthouse, medical care, and evacuation of merchant ships is provided for by the Montreux Convention, which regulates navigation in the straits.  According to the media, Turkey has abolished the payment system for collecting fees for passage through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, which was introduced in 1983. \nTurkey calculates the toll in French francs. In 1983, the franc was set at $0.8. Due to inflation and the rise in the price of gold, fees have practically depreciated. From October 7, 2022, the franc exchange rate will be set at four dollars.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Ouch!
