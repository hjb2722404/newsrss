It reveals the extent of child poverty in these countries and how these cases vary from middle-to-high income countries. Titled <em>Child Poverty in the Midst of Wealth</em>, this report is the latest in the Innocenti Report Card series, which observe children‚Äôs well-being in high-income countries. Within these countries, over 69 million children were living in households earning less than 60 percent of the average national income level. Across these countries, there was a reported 8 percent decrease in poverty levels between 2014 to 2021. During this period of relative prosperity, countries took this as an opportunity to address child poverty with varying levels of success.\nOf the countries assessed for this report, Slovenia, Poland, Finland and Denmark reported child poverty reduction rates that exceeded 30 percent. By contrast, higher-income countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and France, reported a high percentage of child poverty, and even saw these rates increase in recent years.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/12/12/35558\">Read the full story, ‚ÄúThe Solutions to Child Poverty Must Reach the Most Vulnerable Communities‚Äù, on globalissues.org</a> ‚Üí</p>",

However, Israeli intelligence now believes that the money played a role in the success of the Oct. 7 attacks.

Critics label the phrase as 'antisemitic' and a rallying cry used by anti-Israel voices. CAIR argues that the school district selectively enforced its policy on email signatures. El-Haggan offered to remove the phrase but was kept on administrative leave. CAIR's complaint alleges discrimination based on race and religion.",

This followed the conclusion of the winter session of its 2023 Congregation last week.\r \r Up-to-date professional degree programmes\r These new honorary degree-holders have joined a university that next year will be celebrating its 35th anniversary. Although this is young in institutional terms, HKMU has come far in its short span. Just two years ago it embraced a new name, part of a larger move to push beyond its traditional strengths in parttime and distance education and attract full-time undergraduates by offering a larger number of professional degree programmes.\r \r One of these new popular new programmes is Physiotherapy, backed by a superbly equipped Physiotherapy Centre that also provides services for the local community. Another is Medical Laboratory Science, a sought-after discipline supported by a new 7,000 sq.ft. laboratory that caters to teaching and research across five major medical disciplines. Elsewhere, HKMU has drawn on a HK$73.9 million grant from the Government‚Äôs Enhancement and Start-up Grant Scheme for Self-financing Post-secondary Education to launch degree programmes in two other fields of high demand: Construction Management and Quantity Surveying, and New Music and Interactive Entertainment.\r \r \r \r All HKMU new programmes are being designed to embrace the latest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. As HKMU President Prof. Paul Lam notes, ‚ÄúFor students, AI literacy will be one of the most important skills of the future, and it‚Äôs our University‚Äôs job to ensure they have it.‚Äù Existing programmes are also being ‚Äúretrofitted‚Äù with AI components to realise this vision.\r \r Productive industry partnerships\r These new programmes are turning out ever-increasing numbers of skilled graduates, and the University‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Ukraine's top general Valery Zaluzhny recently identified five areas that the country‚Äôs armed forces need to work on in order to regain an edge over the Russians. Two of them involve drones: the drones themselves, and the techniques for jamming them. Big and small, in the air, on land and in the sea, unmanned vehicles are absolutely central to this war, and the technology is evolving rapidly. But while Ukraine is a hotbed of innovation, quantity matters as well as quality. And that's where Ukraine is lagging behind Russia. Our correspondent Gulliver Cragg takes a look at the constellation of companies, military units and government programmes trying to provide Ukraine with the drone capacity it needs.",

Thom Tillis (R-NC) told reporters that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky faced off against conspiracy theories while meeting members of Congress Tuesday ‚Äî including one that he used aid from the United States to buy a $75 million yacht. \nThe Associated Press reported in September that a conspiracy theory broke out on social media when someone posted a YouTube video claiming \"Ukrainian President Zelensky uses proxies to hide ownership of two yachts worth $75,000,000.\" \nThe account hasn't posted any other videos. According to the BBC, the source was \"very suspect\" and has no other presence anywhere online. \nThe company selling the yachts also confirmed to the AP that it wasn't true. \n‚ÄúWe can confirm that the yacht has not been sold and therefore remains for sale,\" the company's spokesperson, Nicci Perides, told the AP.\nALSO READ: Mention ‚ÄòLiz Cheney 2024‚Äô and things get very, very awkward on Capitol Hill\nBut the conspiracy that spread online is now apparently influencing whether or not Republicans will back Zelensky's request for funds necessary to continue fighting off Russia. \nFox reporter Chad Pergram paraphrased Tillis saying in passing that, \"It was helpful that President Zelensky focused on some of the myths around yachts being bought with the money coming from the United States.\"\nTillis went on to say that he and others are aware of what is happening on the ground in Ukraine and he is confident that the money is being sent properly. He cautioned that if lawmakers failed to support Ukraine, the U.S. would be spending a lot more money if they walked away from them.",

One provision removes a ban on expelling those migrants who arrived in France before the age of 13, as was the case for the alleged Russian-born Islamist militant who killed a French teacher in October.\nOther provisions that have been hotly debated are whether non-EU migrants should continue to get access to free medical coverage in France, as well as the government‚Äôs aim to facilitate the legalisation of workers in industries suffering from labour shortages such as cafes and restaurants.\n(Reuters)",
