          "description": "[Sponsored Article] \r \r  \r The big day is fast approaching for a 16-strong team of students taking the MBA programme at City University of Hong Kong’s College of Business. \r \r On May 30 from 7-9pm, after close to eight months planning and preparation, they will be hosting a high-profile online event featuring senior figures connected to the world of fashion. \r \r Fellow CityU students, along with design professionals, environmentalists and interested members of the public will be able to sign in free on various social media channels to hear invited speakers discuss the topic “From Fashion Conscious to Fashion Conscience”, focusing on what the industry must do to build a more sustainable future. \r \r Pulling everything together has been a major organisational challenge, which was exactly the intention. \r \r \r \r That’s because this SHARP Forum, as it’s billed, is one of a series of four, with each overseen by a different group within the MBA class. The other three are focusing on sustainable finance, green building and artificial meats. And, as the key element in a compulsory credit-bearing course, each event is specifically intended to provide practical, experiential learning by exposing the students to wide range of issues - some foreseeable, others unexpected - for which solutions must be found.    \r \r  The two MCs on Monday night will be Mirjam Wong, otherwise a regional IT project manager with a leading global cosmetics company, and Adrian Chong, who since last September has been policy manager for an international accountancy association. \r \r \r \r Understandably at this stage, both are feeling a few butterflies. But those should be calmed after the last few rehearsals and technical run-throughs and by knowing they have a strong line-up of speakers, a topical subject, and back-ups just in case of the odd glitch. \r \r “Even when you plan as well as possible, something will go wrong on the day, especially when technology is involved,” says Wong, who also served as the research coordinator. “But you have to be ready…",

          "description": "Johnny Depp has issued a statement saying he is \"truly humbled\" to have won his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard as she revealed her shock to the verdict.\n\nThe jury found Ms Heard defamed him in her 2018 Washington Post article, alleging she was domestically abused by him. \n\nThe jury of five men and two women reached the verdict unanimously – saying Depp had proven all elements of defamation.\n\nThe jury also found the majority of Ms Heard's allegations to be false and conveyed a defamatory implication.\n\nShe was awarded $US2 million for one of her claims, but Johnny Depp is to receive $US15 million in total damages.\n\nDepp said the jury’s decision gave him his life back and that he was “truly humbled” by the outcome.\n\n\"Speaking the truth was something that I owed to my children and to all those who have remained steadfast in their support of me,” he said in a statement.\n\n“I feel at peace knowing I have finally accomplished that.\"\n\nMs Heard also issued a statement saying she was disappointed she had lost the right “to speak freely and openly”.\n\n\"The disappointment I feel today is beyond words,\" Heard said.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence and sway of my ex-husband.\n\n\"I'm even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback.\"",

Maybe three visits from her lawyer just to prepare for the trial, she’s not had one phone call with family, with children, nothing,” he said.",

Oleksandr Zinchenko, Ukrainian midfielder, had spoken of pride, of freedom, of proving to the world that his country “would never give up”.  He had filled with tears as he spoke.\nHis coach, Oleksandr Petrakov, had admitted that many of his players were absorbed in the thoughts of family members trapped at home, haunted by air raid sirens and threatened by war, and still picking up the pieces of lives shattered by a brutal Russian invasion.\nYet as they prepare for Wednesday’s European qualifiers game against Scotland, the first of two playoff games that could ultimately take them and their nation to the World Cup, the players Ukrainians faced a major physical challenge.\nA han…",

          "description": "The Benedicts still find happy moments in their home.  Sometimes they play Uno together.  Sabrina is brimming with excitement when she shows off her mom’s ballet moves or talks about upcoming vacations, her favorite meals or her day at school.  Or they flip through photo albums, remembering vacations on Assateague Island.\nOne afternoon last year, Sabrina sat at the kitchen counter, drawing an intricate plan of a house where she imagined one of her teachers lived.  When Crystol arrived home, Sabrina ran to greet her.  Then she collapsed on the sofa in anticipation of a massage.  Her mother knelt beside her.  Crystol pretended to make pizza on his daughter’s back – kneading the dough, spreading the sauce and sprinkling the cheese.\nBut within an hour, Sabrina would be overwhelmed with disappointment, frustration, or some emotion she couldn’t name.  She stamped her foot, hard.  And start moaning.\n“Do you need help?”  her father asked, his voice even, his eyes averted.\nBetween moans, Sabrina announced, “I’m crazy.”  But she stopped her parents’ efforts to talk to her.  “I hate you,” she said.  “Leave!”\nAt times like this, her mother encourages her to breathe in and out.  “Smell the roses and blow out the candles,” she says.  And his parents are there, frozen, waiting for the continuation.\nWhen Crystol first saw Sabrina, asleep in a crib in the hospital, she cried with happiness.  It was July 2008. Unable to have a baby on their own, she and Jeremy had become foster parents, planning to adopt.  They brought Sabrina home when she was only a day and a half old.\nThey weren’t intimidated by what the fostering agency told them: Sabrina’s biological mother and father both had developmental disabilities and the father had been arrested for sexual assault.\n\nSource Link",

You’ll be asked to make your choice for Governor (Governor Gavin Newsom is up for re-election), Lieutenant Governor, Treasurer, Attorney General and more.\nYou will be asked to vote for a representative of the House.  And you’ll be asked to vote for the US senator – twice: once to fill out the rest of Vice President Kamala Harris’ term, which ends in January, and once for the full six-year term that begins after that. .\nThen, depending on where you live, you’ll have local elections for your city council, district attorney, mayor, state legislators and more.  (In San Francisco, for example, voters will be asked if they should recall Chesa Boudin, the district attorney.)\nHow does the California primary system work?\nSince 2011, California has had what’s called a first-two primary system, which means the top two candidates will advance in the November general election, regardless of their political party.  The November races could be matchups between two Democrats or two Republicans, rather than between the top Democrat and the top Republican.\nIn almost all statewide elections, there will be a runoff, even if a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.  The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is a notable exception.\nIn local races, a candidate can win with the majority of votes.  The most publicized example is the race for mayor of Los Angeles.  (If a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote this month, they will become mayor without facing a runoff in November.)\nWho should I vote for?\nOf course, we cannot answer that.  But you may want to read your local newspaper’s recommendations, as they will have interviewed candidates.  here are the candidates endorsed by the Los Angeles Times in state and local elections in Southern California.  The Sacramento Bee has compiled its endorsements here.  And here’s the San Francisco Chronicle list of endorsements for national and local elections.\n\nSource Link",

Then he lost his balance, and his metal leg, fitted with his old combat boot, hit the ground.  Undeterred, he stood up and pushed forward, staring determinedly at his reflection in the mirror.\n“In his head, he’s already there, with his comrades,” said prosthetics specialist Viktoriia Olikh, hovering behind him.  She is helping to equip Mr. Tkachenko, 25, with a limb he hopes will bring him back to the battlefield.\nMr Tkachenko lost his left leg on the second day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when an artillery shell blew it off and tore his right thigh, leaving a web of dark red scars.  He is among the first in what Ukrainian doctors fear will become a devastating wave of amputation…",

But a few days spent reading the Israeli press and engaging in political conversations dispels that illusion.  There are too many similarities between Israeli and American politics.\n\nIn Israel as in the United States, the opposing forces are deeply divided and the majority of the current government is hanging by a thread.  In both countries, various coalitions are held together by mistrust and hatred on the other side.  Right-wing forces are campaigning tirelessly against the threat of an undifferentiated “left” while the center and the far left fear the return to …",

But a late crash by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion competing in his first Indianapolis 500, brought out a red flag that stopped the race with four laps remaining.\nIn a two-lap shootout after the restart, Ericsson veered left and right to disrupt the slipstream and repel an intense charge from O’Ward to take the checkered flag.\n“I knew the car was pretty fast, but it was still tough,” Ericsson told NBC after the race…",

          "description": "Ripple (XRP) has announced a $100 million investment in the carbon trading segment, CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Cointelegraph’s Joseph Hall in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting, which ended Thursday. \nGarlinghouse noted the growing profile of the cryptocurrency at the international summit, comparing his experiences over the past few years.  “As leaders around the world learn how these technologies can really benefit their constituents, benefit their economies, they are going to use them. […] I think we see that happening every day,” Garlinghouse said.\nHe went on to say that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are “underappreciated, despite the fact that there is obviously a lot of hype in some parts of the NFT market.”  Specifically:\n\n“The tokenization of various assets is underestimated.” \n\nGarlinghouse cited the trade in carbon credits, which is often “challenged” by fraudulent activities, such as a use case for tokenization thanks to its transparency and traceability.  “It could really revolutionize carbon credit markets, the efficiency of carbon credit markets,” Garlinghouse said.  Ripple is investing $100 million in the segment, he added. \nRelated: WEF 2022: Trust and clarity lacking in carbon emissions and crypto talks\nCryptocurrency will have real-world use cases in 2022, Garlinghouse continued.  Cross-border transactions are an example that Ripple is working on.  Currently, cross-border transactions are “generally quite slow, quite expensive, and frankly very error-prone,” while the XRP blockchain has been “a very efficient and inexpensive bridge,” he said.\n“I don’t think we live in a one-channel world,” Garlinghouse said.  “It’s a multi-channel world, there will be a lot of different utility use cases.”  Ripple will continue to focus on businesses, but other cryptocurrency foundations are also looking at consumer use cases, he explained. \nThe full conversation is on our Youtube channel.

This reflects a common care deficit for your wider community, those who are vulnerable and those who are not.  A speech-language pathologist is not a pediatric care provider or medical professional.  Few of our city’s pediatricians or public health providers agree with your short-sighted desire to rekindle the outbreak of disease that always follows mandatory mask removal. \nI can only hope you don’t succeed in your quest to put children and families at risk, including my own student who ultimately experienced a case of COVID after being exposed by an official count more than 20 times at the high school despite wearing his mask.\nI wish you and your families good health and safety at school.

After Donbas Russian forces will be focused on the city of Zaporizhhia (see the above map),  and after that the city of Dnipro. \nThis is open country, and ideal terrain for Russian forces to do what they have always been trained to do. Conduct operations that isolate enemy units, and then destroy them with artillery. \nOn another sad note. This region and the Donbas has always been the industrial heartland of Ukraine. Its loss will be incalculable for Ukraine, and the Kremlin knows it.",
