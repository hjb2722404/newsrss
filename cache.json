The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.\"\nThe asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Colin Kaepernick targets Kevin McCarthy's crime-ridden California district\nThe rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.\nBy comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.",

A spokesperson for China’s defense ministry said in a statement Thursday that the minister refused the call because the U.S. had “not created the proper atmosphere,” for the two parties to dialogue and had “seriously violated international norms and set a pernicious precedent,” AP reported.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: ‘It just rang’: In crises, US-China hotline goes unanswered (AP)   \nWNU Editor: This is nothing new.

Chase Doak/via REUTERS   \nNew York Times: China Sends Spy Balloons Over Military Sites Worldwide, U.S. Officials Say \nWASHINGTON — American intelligence agencies have assessed that China’s spy balloon program is part of a global surveillance effort that is designed to collect information on the military capabilities of countries around the world, according to three American officials. \nThe balloon flights, some officials believe, are part of an effort by China to hone its ability to gather data about American military bases — in which it is most interested — as well as those of other nations in the event of a conflict or rising tensions. \nThe balloons have some advantages over the satellites that orbit the earth in regular patterns, U.S. officials say. They fly closer to earth and drift with wind patterns, which are not as predictable to militaries and intelligence agencies as the fixed orbits of satellites, and they can evade radar. They can also hover over areas while satellites are generally in constant motion. Simple cameras on balloons can produce clearer images than those on orbital satellites, and other surveillance equipment can pick up signals that do not reach the altitude of satellites.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The US continues to retrieve fragments from the Chinese balloon that was shot down on Sunday(see video below):",
