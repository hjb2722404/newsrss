          "description": "The United States, Israel and four Arab countries agreed to closer cooperation and annual foreign ministers' meetings on Monday, two weeks before President Joe Biden's first visit to the Middle East.\nBahrain, host of the six-way talks, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco all opened ties with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, while Egypt made peace with the Jewish state in 1979.\nMonday's meeting follows a foreign ministers' summit in the Negev desert in March, and comes ahead of Biden's visit to Israel, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Saudi Arabia from July 13 to 16.\n\"We're trying to build a new regional framework... and tangible initiatives that can put flesh on the bones of the Negev forum,\" said Yael Lempert, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs.\nWorking groups will investigate cooperation on six areas including security, clean energy and food and water security. A joint statement also gave support for a negotiated settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n\"It's a very holistic approach, towards trying to advance this goal of building a new architecture that really has meaningful results,\" Lempert told reporters.\nThe six countries' foreign ministers are expected to meet annually and the next ministerial talks should take place later this year, the statement said.\nThe Manama meeting is part of a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region ahead of Biden's visit, which Washington has played up as a boost for regional ties.\nThe US president has drawn heavy criticism over the trip, which contradicts his description of Saudi Arabia as a \"pariah\" over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.\nHis visit to the world's top oil exporter follows a sharp rise in crude prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, causing pain for US voters and economies around the world.\n© 2022 AFP",

José Ricardo Orozco told local Blu Radio. “Four people have died, as of this moment: two women, a man and a minor.”\nMayor Juan Carlos Tamayo said 800 spectators were seated in the sections that collapsed.\nLate Sunday, Tolima health secretary Martha Palacios said in a press conference that 322 people had gone to local public and private hospitals after the collapse seeking treatment. Palacio said the minor who had died was an 18-month-old baby.\nBesides the four dead, another four people were in intensive care and two others recovering from surgery.\nOrozco said he had asked for the traditional “corralejas” to be suspended in Tolima earlier Sunday but this one was held anyway.\nPresident-elect Gustavo Petro urged local officials to ban such events, noting that it was not the first time an incident like this had taken place.\n“I ask mayors not to allow more events involving the death of people or animals,” he said.\nCurrent President Iván Duque on Twitter announced an investigation of the disaster.\n“We lament the terrible tragedy registered in El Espinal, Tolima, during the festivals of San Pedro and San Juan, with the collapse of the stands during a corraleja.

In February, when Democratic lawmakers explored the ideaSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, called it a gimmick.\n\n\nThe national average for regular gasoline was $4.98 a gallon on Monday, according to AAAafter $5 topping this month.  Oil and refined fuel prices hit their highest level in 14 years, largely due to The Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions, as well as a rebound in energy consumption as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\nThe White House and congressional Democrats have been discussing a nationwide gas tax exemption as one of the few options to reduce the cost at the pump, as external factors have been key drivers behind the surge. price.  The high cost of gas is emerging as a significant handicap for Mr. Biden and Democratic lawmakers as the midterm elections approach.\nWhen gas prices jumped in March, the White House turned towards the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, ordering the release of up to one million barrels of oil a day for 180 days in hopes of meeting demand.  The overall effect has been limited and gasoline prices remain close to record highs.\nMr Biden said on Monday that his team planned to meet with the CEOs of major oil companies this week.  He reprimanded some of the biggest oil companies last week to make a profit as US consumers suffered high prices.\n\nSource Link",

Certainly not the economy imploding or the ruble crashing as President Biden was saying in March. \nMy prediction. \nRussia will be shifting its economic focus away from the West and more to Asia and the emerging economies in the Middle East and Africa. And what the West should be worried about is the growing ties between Russia and China and their mutual desire to establish a financial system independent from the West, and the dethronement of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency.",

But at the end of the day on Sunday, the grace period on about $100 million of snared interest payments due May 27 expired, a deadline considered an event of default if missed.\nIt’s a grim marker in the country’s rapid transformation into an economic, financial and political outcast. The nation’s eurobonds have traded at distressed levels since the start of March, the central bank’s foreign reserves remain frozen, and the biggest banks are severed from the global financial system.    \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: This default is mostly symbolic. Russia has more than enough funds that are frozen in the central banks of North America and Europe to pay these financial notes.
