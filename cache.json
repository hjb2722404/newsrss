          "description": "Ukraine’s breakthrough counterattack, explained.\n In the spring and summer of 2022, the war between Ukraine and Russia settled into a stalemate. The first phase of the war had been a rapid invasion that drew new battle lines across Ukraine; the next phase saw those battle lines harden and change very little over a long period of fighting. But in September, that chapter came to an end. For the first time in several months, Ukraine scored a major victory and won back significant territory from Russia.\nUkraine pulled off this victory by taking advantage of a surprising weakness in the Russian army: the difficulty it has had maintaining its ranks of skilled soldiers, especially compared to the training and resources Ukraine’s army has received from its allies. Reports suggest that Russia’s army has suffered catastrophic losses in the war and that it has attempted to replace those more highly trained forces with large numbers of mercenaries, prisoners, and men over 40. It’s an army that was stretched thin and vulnerable to the multi-pronged attack Ukraine launched in September.\n\n\n\nRussia still controls a large amount of territory in southern Ukraine, including two major cities. But Ukraine’s victory outside of Kharkiv signals a new chapter in the war — one where, remarkably, Ukraine seems to have a shot at driving out the Russians completely. \nWatch the video to learn more about why this attack worked and why it matters so much.\nYou can find this video and more on Vox’s YouTube Channel.",

But faced with calls by European Union officials and human rights activists, it allowed a shortened route for the march.\nThose participating walked several hundred metres to the Tsmajdan stadium where a concert took place.\nThe United States' ambassador to Serbia, Christopher Hill, and the European parliament's special rapporteur for Serbia, Vladimir Bilcik, joined the march.\nPrevious Serbian governments have banned Pride parades, drawing criticism from human rights groups and others. Some Pride marches in the early 2000s met with fierce opposition and were marred by violence.\nBut recent Pride marches in Serbia have passed off peacefully, a change cited by EuroPride organisers as one reason Belgrade was chosen as this year's host. Copenhagen was the host in 2021.\nSerbia is a candidate to join the EU, but it must first meet demands to improve the rule of law and its record on human and minority rights.\n(Reporting by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Christina Fincher)",

          "description": "TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's president on Friday decreed a law imposing prison terms for spreading false information or rumours online, a move immediately denounced by the main journalists' union as an assault on freedom of speech.\nPresident Kais Saied had said he would uphold the rights and freedoms won by Tunisians in a 2011 revolution that brought democracy after his moves last summer to seize most powers and shut down the elected parliament.\nHis new law on Friday, issued as a presidential decree, provided for prison terms of five years for spreading false news, false information or rumours with the aim of attacking others, harming public security or generating terror.\nIf the target of the false information or rumours is an official, the prison term can be 10 years, his new law said.\n\"The decree is a new setback for rights and freedoms. The penalties for publishing in any networks are a strong blow to the revolutionary values that granted freedom to all journalists and all Tunisians,\" said Mahdi Jlassi, the journalists' union head.\nJlassi added that the new law was reminiscent of those used by the late autocratic president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to crack down on dissenting opponents.\nSince Tunisia's 2011 revolution, its media has become one of the most open of any Arab state, with even the state-owned news agency frequently reporting criticism of the authorities.\nActivists on social media sites criticised Saied's decree, describing it as an effort to destroy those hard-won freedoms. Others mocked it, saying they would only publish sports news or art on their social media accounts.\nSaied's critics accuse him of having launched a coup last summer when he seized executive authority, moving to one-man rule with a series of decrees that he enshrined in a constitution passed by a referendum in July.\nSaied has denied acting unlawfully and says his actions were needed to save Tunisia from years of stagnation and political paralysis.\n(Reporting by Tarek Amara; Writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

          "description": "Former world number one and 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer has announced he will retire from tennis after the Laver Cup in London later this month. \n\nThe 41-year-old made the announcement via a social media message posted on Twitter on Thursday. \n\nThe sporting icon cited injuries as the main reason behind his decision to retire. \n\n“As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries,” Mr Federer said. \n\n“I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form, but I also know my body’s capacities and limits and its message to me lately has been clear. \n\n“Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognise when it is time to end my competitive career.”",

          "description": "This rare Wisconsin home has never changed hands – until now. \nA pastoral Mount Pleasant mansion built by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1954 has gone up for sale for the first time – and its broker has been inundated with calls. \n“I don’t expect it to last into the weekend,” said Re/Max Newport Elite’s Anthony Veranth Crain’s company in Chicago of the low-slung property, which hit the market on Saturday.  By Tuesday, he said, he had already scheduled a dozen screenings. \nThe six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home is asking $725,000 for the “rare opportunity to own a work by America’s most prominent architect.”  Buyers should expect to pay a bit above the list price, as Veranth warns that the home, while well-maintained over the years, needs roof repairs, among other updates.  Including those in the payment puts the figure between $900,000 and $1 million, he told Crain’s. \nBuilt by Wright for the family behind consumer chemicals company Johnson Wax, the 3-acre property is currently owned by a trust linked to the great-granddaughter of company founder Samuel Curtis Johnson.  This great-granddaughter, Karen Johnson Boyd, commissioned the house from Wright and lived there until her death in 2016. Her widower, Bill Boyd, died in 2020. \nMembers of the Johnson family were big fans of Wright and commissioned him at least two other properties: their headquarters and a vacation home. \nThe main house is 4,978 square feet and sits on a ravine bluff overlooking Wisconsin’s Root River.  It is located approximately 77 miles north of downtown Chicago. \n“The dramatic and expansive Great Hall cantilevered over the ravine, emphasizing the continuity between indoors and outdoors”, claims the list of the complex, “blending with nature and maximizing the views”.  All but one of the six bedrooms have an en-suite bathroom and a balcony overlooks the main living space.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "View co-host Sarah Haines absurdly claimed on Wednesday that “there are no such thing as people having late-term abortions.”\nDuring a discussion about Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introducing a bill on Tuesday that would have banned abortion after 15 weeks – with exceptions for the mother’s life in danger, rape or incest – Haines noted that 15 weeks is the first week of the second trimester of pregnancy.\n“By the way, 15 weeks for anyone who doesn’t know is a week in your second trimester,” she said.  “And just to clear up a myth that’s often used to get a certain political outcome, there’s no such thing as people having late-term abortions.”\n“There’s no such thing as people having late-term abortions,” Haines reiterated, after some encouragement from the co-host Whoopi Goldberg.\nThe claim th…",

          "description": "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, then there is a very high probability that Russian propaganda claims that this creature is a tiger.  In the world in which Russians live today, a tiger may very well have wings, a beak and fins, if the Kremlin wishes.  But in this reality, even darker things are possible.\n\nIn Russia, nearly a quarter of the population lacks sanitation facilities, but missiles are considered a priority.\n\nIn Russia, its rulers can weaponize nearly a quarter of the world’s natural gas reserves, but nearly a third of households cannot heat their homes.\n\nIn Russia, they like “grandeur”.  But this most nebulous concept is never measured by economic development, well-being or quality of life.  The Russians measure it by fear.\n\nTerror is part of life …",

And now we have the above CNN report quoting US officials admitting that sanctions are not wrecking the Russian economy, but they are confident that it will in 2023. \nIn the meantime the European economy is in a recession. The U.S. is technically in a recession. Inflation is very real, and there are now growing fears that the energy crisis in Europe is going to cause widespread unrest this winter. From my vantage point it looks like sanctions are hurting the West, not Russia. \nAnd as for the push by many in Washington to up the sanctions by designating Russia as a state sponsor of terror. Russian President Putin has made it very clear that such an announcement by the U.S. will be seen by the Kremlin as a declaration of war against Russia by Washington.",

Still, it’s been a howler to watch NATOstan media on Kharkov, gloating in unison about “the hammer blow that knocks out Putin”, “the Russians are in trouble”, and assorted inanities. \nFacts: Russian forces withdrew from the territory of Kharkov to the left bank of the Oskol river, where they are now entrenched. A Kharkov-Donetsk-Luhansk line seems to be stable. Krasny Liman is threatened, besieged by superior Ukrainian forces, but not lethally. \nNo one – not even Maria Zakharova, the contemporary female equivalent of Hermes, the messenger of the Gods – knows what the Russian General Staff (RGS) plans, in this case and all others.
