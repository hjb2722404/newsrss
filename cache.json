          "description": "Washington Post: A mile-long line for free food offers a warning as covid benefits end \nHAZEL GREEN, Ky. — As he claimed the first spot in a mile-long line for free food in the Appalachian foothills, Danny Blair vividly recalled receiving the letter announcing that his pandemic-era benefit to help buy groceries was about to be slashed. \nKentucky lawmakers had voted to end the state’s health emergency last spring, by default cutting food stamp benefits created to help vulnerable Americans like Blair weather the worst of covid-19. Instead of $200 a month, he would get just $30.\n He crumpled up the letter and threw it on the floor of his camper.  “I thought, ‘Wow, the government is trying to kill us now,’” said Blair, 63, who survives on his Social Security disability check and lives in a mobile home with his wife after their house burned down five years ago. “They are going to starve us out.” \nBlair and his wife hop into their truck twice a month at 4 a.m. to ensure they get a few staples at the Hazel Green Food Project’s giveaway. On a recent Friday, they waited nine hours until local prisoners on work duty started loading bags of meat and vegetables, potato chips and cookies into vehicles in one of the nation’s most impoverished communities.    \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: The US is not alone. Food insecurity is becoming a bigger and more pressing crisis for almost every country in the world. There are many reasons for this, but IMHO inflation is creating a life affordability crisis for the globe, and with most governments facing debt levels that only keep growing, limiting their options to help.\nOn a side note. For me it is strange to watch people spending hours waiting in line for food in large pick-up trucks.",

          "description": "U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in Kyiv, Ukraine on February 20, 2023. (Photo by Presidency of Ukraine/Handout/Anadolu Agency   \nThomas Meaney, New York Times: In Ukraine, the United States Is In Over Its Head \nThe greatest blunder President Vladimir Putin may have made so far in Ukraine is giving the West the impression that Russia could lose the war. The early Russian strike on Kyiv stumbled and failed. The Russian behemoth seemed not nearly as formidable as it had been made out to be. The war suddenly appeared as a face-off between a mass of disenchanted Russian incompetents and supercharged, savvy Ukrainian patriots. \nSuch expectations naturally ratcheted up Ukrainian war aims. President Volodymyr Zelensky was once a member of the peace-deal camp in Ukraine. “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it,” he declared one month into the conflict. Now he calls for complete victory: the reconquering of every inch of Russian-occupied territory, including Crimea. Polls indicate that Ukrainians will settle for nothing less. As battles rage across Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine’s leaders and some of their Western backers are already dreaming of Nuremberg-style trials of Mr. Putin and his inner circle in Moscow.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I'm surprised the New York Times has published an alternate view of Ukraine's plight. It looks like the groundwork is being laid for a change in the Western narrative on what to expect from the Russia - Ukraine war.",
