They also targeted Guryev's son and Caribbean-based yacht Alfa Nero.\nViktor Filippovich Rashnikov, one of Russia's largest taxpayers, and two subsidiaries of his MMK, which is among the world's largest steel producers, also were slapped with sanctions, as well as two other Russian elites: Alina Maratovna Kabaeva and Natalya Valeryevna Popova, the statement said.\n\"The Treasury Department will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin's enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives,\" Yellen said, adding that the goal is \"to choke off revenue and equipment underpinning Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine.\"\nIn a joint action, the State Department imposed sanctions, including visa restrictions, on oligarchs \"running massive revenue-generating companies,\" including Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy, Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko and Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko, as well as nearly 900 officials, and a series of defense- and technology-related firms aiding \"Russia's war machine.\"\nThe Treasury sanctions seize any US-based funds or property owned by the individuals or organizations, and prohibit American-based firms from having any financial dealings with them, although investors will have a few weeks to wind down transactions with MMK.",

But according to an NBC report from 2020, former President Donald Trump had an opportunity to do the same, but refused because he didn't recognize al-Zawahiri's name. \nReporting in early 2020, NBC News reported that intelligence officials briefed then-President Trump many times about the most worrisome terrorist threats, specifically mentioning al-Zawahri.\nTrump would ultimately agree to take out ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Yemeni al Qaeda chief Qasim al-Rimi. But other of the significant names on the CIA's list were ignored.  \nTrump \"was more interested in a young and less influential figure much farther down the list, according to two people familiar with the briefings, because he recognized the name,\" the report said at the time. \n\n\"He would say, 'I've never heard of any of these people. What about Hamza bin Laden?'\" the former official told NBC.\nA Pentagon official agreed, noting, \"That was the only name he knew.\" \nBy contrast, Biden explained that after \"relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year. He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family.\"\n\"This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians, and one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success,\" Biden also said.",

Mark Hertling broke down the significance of the successful U.S. strike that took out Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda who took over from Osama bin Laden.\nZawahiri, noted Hertling, has been sought by the U.S. for decades — and was a critical piece of the terrorist operation.\n\"How significant is this strike killing the al-Qaeda leader?\" asked anchor Wolf Blitzer.\n\"This is a target the U.S. has been going after for three decades, even before the 9/11 strike,\" said Hertling. \"He leads al-Qaeda with various networks around the globe. Central places in control. These areas, we're talking about an individual who is the CEO of this organization. You can debate how powerful he is, compared to bin Laden, but it's a big deal.\"\nAnother important aspect, said Hertling, is how the U.S. was able to take him out despite no longer having on-the-ground intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan, having withdrawn U.S. forces last year.\n\"This is more than likely a drone strike. I would give that a 70 percent possibility,\" said Hertling. \"I would not rule out a hand strike on this individual, either. What you are talking about, the kinds of things we were talking about when we withdrew from Afghanistan, this will be an over-the-horizon strike with very little capability for collecting intelligence within Afghanistan. This was a significant hit by both the intelligence community and anyone who pulled off the operation.\"\nWatch below or at this link. \n\n\nRet. Gen. Mark Hertling on the strike against Ayman al-Zawahiri\n\nwww.youtube.com",

Biden will address the nation at 7:30 p.m. EST Monday evening. \nHe is among the most pursued terrorists in the world after the slaying of Osama bin Laden, MSNBC reported. \nThe Times also reported that the operation was not a military one, and instead was conducted through the CIA. The government won't respond to questions about it, however. \nAl-Zawahiri was among the top organizers of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Towers, the Washington Post described. \n\"Zawahiri was a senior adviser to bin Laden at the time of al-Qaeda’s first high-profile terrorist attacks, the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania that killed hundreds of people,\" said the report. \"Three years later, working from al-Qaeda’s base in Afghanistan, he helped oversee the planning of what would become one of history’s most audacious terrorist attacks: the Sept. 11 strikes in New York and Washington.\"\nSept. 11 hijackers were sent to begin training in the U.S. while Zawahiri was in charge of following up on other terrorist attacks that aimed to weaken the U.S. economy. \n\"He launched an ambitious biological weapons program, establishing a laboratory in Afghanistan and dispatching disciples to search for sympathetic scientists as well as lethal strains of anthrax bacteria,\" said the Post.",

But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,\" Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" he said, calling on nations to \"put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.\"\nGuterres's comments came at the opening 10th review conference of the NPT, an international treaty that came into force in 1970 to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\nThe meeting, held at the UN's headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will run until August 26.\nGuterres said the conference was \"a chance to strengthen\" the treaty and \"make it fit for the worrying world around us,\" citing Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East.\n\"Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used,\" the secretary-general implored, adding that he would visit Hiroshima for the anniversary of the August 6, 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city by the United States.\n\"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,\" Guterres added.\nIn January, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- had pledged to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons.\nAt the last review conference in 2015, the parties were unable to reach agreement on substantive issues.\n© 2022 AFP",

He was “the street fighter”, she writes, “not loud and feisty but quiet, stubborn”, never shaking the feeling that he was acting “with his back against the wall, writing, composing, negotiating his way out of a corner”.\nMary Ellin Berlin, born November 25, 1926 in Manhattan, grew up in a different world.  His childhood memories included dinners with the Astaires, the Goldwyns, the Capras, and Somerset Maugham, who, lying on the floor, placed a glass of water on his forehead and stood up without spilling a drop.\nAlthough she sometimes had to chase her father for attention and felt alienated by the fame of her parents – her mother, Ellin Mackay, was an heiress and popular novelist—Mary Ellin felt less resentment than delight at her good fortune.  When she relentlessly invited people to family theater seats for her father’s 1946 Broadway smash hit, “Annie Get Your Gun,” an annoyed friend told her to stop.\n\nSource Link",

During a chaotic period in the late 1980s, inflation soared to an almost unbelievable 3,000% and locals rushed to get groceries before clerks with price guns could do so. their turn.  Today, high inflation is back, exceeding 30% every year since 2018.\nTo understand how Argentines are coping, we spent two weeks in and around Buenos Aires, talking to economists, politicians, farmers, restaurant owners, real estate agents, barbers, taxi drivers, moneychangers coins, street artists, street vendors and the unemployed.\nThe economy isn’t always the best topic of conversation, but in Argentina it has animated just about everyone, sparking curses, deep sighs, and educated opinions on monetary policy.  One woman happily showed her stash for a wad of US dollars (an old ski jacket), another explained how she stuffed money in her bra to buy a condo, and a Venezuelan waitress snuck up. is asked if she had immigrated to the right country.\nOne thing has become startlingly clear: Argentines have developed a very unusual relationship with their money.\nThey spend their pesos as quickly as they receive them.  They buy everything from televisions to potato peelers in installments.  They don’t trust banks.  They barely use credit.  And after years of constant price hikes, they have little idea what things should cost.\nArgentina shows that people will find a way to adapt to years of high inflation, living in an economy that is impossible to imagine almost anywhere else in the world.  Life is especially manageable for those who can afford to turn the system upside down.  But all of these stark workarounds mean that few of those who have held political power through years of economic distress have found themselves paying the real price.\n\nSource Link",
