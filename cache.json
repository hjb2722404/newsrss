It’s perhaps a natural path for any traitor... He betrayed his entire Soviet past,” he said. “Our weapon-makers are more talented anyway. Our men are more ingenious because we’re Russians—of many different nationalities. God is with us! Either we will win, or humanity will cease to exist, because the Lord won’t stand for the triumph of warriors of the Antichrist.

The total should include 695,000 professional contract soldiers, he said, without explaining where the additional recruits would be found. \nThe commitment to spare no expense on the war will be a strain on government finances as the proceeds from energy exports come under pressure from price restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. While Russia is running a record current-account surplus this year, the flow of money is expected to weaken in 2023 as sales of gas to Europe plunge and Group of Seven sanctions curb Russia’s oil revenue.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: One third of the Kremlin's budget for 2023 is now slated for the military.

With winter approaching, it appeared the Kremlin intended to strangle the flow of energy to millions across the continent, an act of “blackmail,” some leaders said, designed to threaten countries into withdrawing their financial and military support for Ukraine. \nBut now, after months of investigation, numerous officials privately say that Russia may not be to blame after all for the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. \n “There is no evidence at this point that Russia was behind the sabotage,” said one European official, echoing the assessment of 23 diplomatic and intelligence officials in nine countries interviewed in recent weeks.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Russian media is playing up this Washington Post story .... No evidence Russia is behind Nord Stream blasts – WaPo (RT). More here .... No evidence of Russia behind Nord Stream attack — newspaper (TASS). \nAs to what is my take.\nRussia's Gazprom spent 10 years and $23 billion dollars to build these pipelines with the expectation that almost $1 trillion will be earned over the course of the lifetime of these pipelines. So yes. I will admit that I have trouble understanding the logic from those who say that Russia is the one who is responsible for blowing up their own gas pipelines. I mean .... they could have simply closed the taps.",
