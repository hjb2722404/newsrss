They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.\nAbdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.\n\nHe told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.\nSix years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.\n\"Evil did not win,\" he said. \"You can't kill rock and roll.\"\n(REUTERS)",

          "description": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - His doctors probably don't agree but Pope Francis thinks a shot of tequila just might help his painful knee.\nWhile his popemobile stopped in St. Peter's Square at his last general audience, a group of Mexican seminarians shouted out to him, asking how his leg was doing.\n\"It's being naughty,\" the Argentine pope replied in Spanish. A flare up of pain in his knee and existing leg problems have forced the pope to use a wheelchair at times recently.\nOne of seminarians then thanked the seated pope for continuing to carry out his duties despite the pain, telling the 85-year-old Francis that his persistence was an example for them as future priests.\nNoting that they were Mexican because of the flag they were carrying, the pope said: \"Do you know what I need for my leg? A bit of tequila.\"\nAfter much laughter, one of them shouted back: \"If one day we go to Santa Marta, we'll bring you a bottle,\" referring to the guest house where Francis lives in the Vatican.\nOne of the seminarians, Rodrigo Fernández de Castro, posted the exchange, which took place at the general audience last Wednesday, on TikTok.\n(Writing by Philip Pullella; Editing by Alison Williams)",

All of that, to put it mildly, is false.\"\nREAD MORE: Liz Cheney is 'more aggressive than even some Democrats in wanting to go directly after Trump': report\nKhodaryonok noted that the United States shipments of advanced military weapons to Ukraine is being effective in helping the country defend itself against the Russian onslaught, \"despite the resistance of a single senator.\" Kentucky Republican Rand Paul last week blocked Senate consideration of a new U.S. aid package to Ukraine.\n\"A million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future,\" Khodaryonok said. \"and we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us frankly will get worse.\"\nWatch the defense analyst's entire take on the Russian war effort below or at this link.\n\nIn an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation.

          "description": "By Natalia Zinets KYIV/NOVOAZOVSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine's military said on Tuesday it was working to evacuate all remaining troops from their last stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol, ceding control of the city to Russia after months of bombardment.

This meeting, which precedes a May 21 summit between Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden, reflects Yoon’s view that North Korea is the South’s “main enemy.”\nYoon’s presidency comes at a tumultuous time in U.S. foreign policy. Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine continues, and it enjoys Chinese support. Strategic competition is expanding with Beijing in the Indo-Pacific. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has conducted 16 missile tests in 2022 so far. Raising the possibility of internal instability in North Korea is the COVID-19 outbreak that Kim has finally admitted to, after more than two years of claiming zero cases in the country.\nIn this context, the South Korea-U.S. alliance remains as important as ever. The upcoming summit provides an opportunity not only to reaffirm the alliance at the start of the Yoon administration, but also to build on the ROK-U.S. vision laid out in the May 2021 summit.\nDave Maxwell\nMon, 05/16/2022 - 11:58am\n\nRead more about Recommendations for Yoon-Biden Summit – Must Build on the Strong Alliance Foundation\nLog in or register to post comments",

But motorized sleds bouncing along a wooded mountain trail in February were quiet save for the sound of metal runners on snow.\nThe machines, made by a Canadian start-up, Taiga, were battery-powered – the first electric snowmobiles to be sold on a large scale – and symbols of how transportation of all kinds is migrating to emission-free propulsion.  Taiga also offers battery-powered personal watercraft, another form of recreation where the gas-powered version is seen in some quarters as a bane.\nWhile electric cars are attracting the most attention, electric lawn mowers, boats, bicycles, scooters and all-terrain vehicles are proliferat…",

Australia this year, and that kept him out.  the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells, California, and Miami Gardens, Florida in March.\nBut with health protocols now relaxed in Europe, Djokovic returned to regular action on clay last month.

They certainly have that now to go with a generous dose of confidence.\nGallant had faith in Panarin, saying after the game he felt the Russian striker, even though he hadn’t come out on top earlier in the game, would pull through.  And he did, with just nine seconds left on the power play.  Panarin took the puck from Adam Fox at the top of the right face-off circle, skated a few steps toward goal, then shot right-footed, beating Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry on the short side through a screen and sparking a wild celebration on the ice and in the stands.\n“Honestly, they let me shoot since the first game,” Panarin said through an interpreter.  “My bad, I didn’t really do those shots. But maybe I should listen to everyone’s advice now and go out and take some shots.\nThe tying goal came with 5:45 left in the third period after a play that angered Penguins coach Mike Sullivan.  Pittsburgh’s Marcus Pettersson lost his helmet behind the Penguins goal after becoming tangled with Rangers forward Alexis Lafrenière.  According to the rule, Pettersson either had to find his helmet and put it back on or leave the ice for safety reasons.  Pettersson walked to the bench.\nKris Letang, Pittsburgh’s top defenseman, took Petterson’s place, but he skated to the net, past Jarry, and was unable to challenge Zibanejad’s shot.  And if Pettersson had been on the ice, he might have helped the Penguins clear the puck.  Sullivan, unsurprisingly, is not a fan of the rule.\n“I think it stinks,” he said.  “He has to go out.  His helmet was intentionally ripped off, but that’s the rule.\nFor the Penguins, who were in the playoffs for the 16th straight year, the loss was particularly hard to bear because it could be the last season for their longtime core of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Letang playing together.  These last two can be free agents and sign with other teams.\n\nSource Link",

Mr Woiwode was 63 when his jacket was caught in the draft shaft of a hay baler, breaking three ribs, compressing his spine and nearly severing his right arm.  As a teenager, her son, Joseph, was trampled by a horse and spent days in a coma;  when he recovered, his motor skills still fragile, he almost lost his fingers because of a mower. \nOne day, setting fire to the weeds blocking a tractor, Mr Woiwode nearly set himself on fire and Joseph, then a toddler strapped to the seat with a cowboy belt.  During a cataclysmic blizzard one winter, it was so cold for so long that Mr Woiwode had to fuel his wood-burning furnace with the dead chickens that had frozen in their coop.\nBut the place also nurtured Mr. Woiwode’s family and work.\n“There is a thump that the virgin ground has here on unshaded ground, so different from cultivated land,” he wrote, “and in the colors of the surrounding painter, in light undimmed by pollution, you can feel like you’re on a soundstage.For a second, you see the entire panorama as being constructed to contain you in its stage.\nThe Woiwodes practiced the Presbyterian faith to which they had turned when their marriage was difficult, and Mr. Woiwode, who had been raised Roman Catholic, often wrote about his chosen faith, about the land and about the biblical stories that supported and shaped it.

          "description": "Kouchner adds, “My grandmother killed herself soon after that.”\nIt’s the second funeral in the book — “a militant, heartbroken crowd who’d come to pay tribute to my grandmother’s freedom to kill herself.”  The suicide leaves Camille’s mother an alcoholic shell.  She drinks herself blind every night: “This is absolutely not up for discussion.  It’s my freedom.”\nThe book is a sharply focused portrait of a certain kind of privileged French family of its era, first revolutionary and then bourgeois: their sexual mores, their thirst for power and fame, the collateral damage to children.  The violation of her brother is explained, midbook, in one sentence: “He started stroking me, and then, you know …”\nFrom this point, the narrator’s voice ages as she comes to understand what this means, and the book takes on aspects of a psychological thriller.  The twins keep the secret for years.  At last, fearful for the safety of their own children, strangled by a “hydra” of guilt and shame, they confide in other members of their family, to decidedly mixed reaction.\nThe book finishes, effectively, in the most adult voice of all, that of the law.  Camille Kouchner addresses her stepfather directly, reciting the text of the French penal code on incest.  “Let’s be clear about this,” she writes:\n\nArticle 222—31—1 of the criminal code\nRape and sexual assaults are classified as incestuous when committed by:\n1) ascending year;\n2) a brother, a sister, an uncle, an aunt, a nephew, or a niece;\n3) or any other person, including a partner or family member, having legal or de facto control over the victim.\n\nClaire Berlinski is the editor in chief of The Cosmopolitan Globalist.  She lives in Paris.\n\nTHE FAMILY GRANDE, by Camille Kouchner |  Translated by Adriana Hunter |  214 p.  Other Press.  |  $24.\n\nSource Link",
