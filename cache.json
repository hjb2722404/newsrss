But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "The Kremlin said Thursday that footage, which could not be verified, apparently showing President Vladimir Putin greeting adoring supporters proved that he has \"astounding\" support after quelling an armed insurrection.\nMoscow has insisted that Putin's long rule has not been weakened after Wagner mercenaries marched hundreds of kilometers -- almost reaching Moscow -- and captured military facilities in southern Russia, appearing to gain some support.\nPutin is rarely seen meeting ordinary Russians, especially since the Covid pandemic, which saw him observe strict isolation rules, with some of those restrictions still in place.\nMoscow late on Wednesday released footage of Putin walking up to a cheering group of mostly women in Derbent, an ancient city in the Dagestan region of southern Russia.\n\"In Derbent, there was an astounding demonstration of support and happiness of the local population,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.\nHe said Putin \"could not refuse\" greeting the crowd.\nSurrounded by men in suits and a cameraman, the 70-year-old leader reached out over a barrier to shake people's hands.\nThen, with his jacket off, he waved goodbye and blew a kiss to the crowd, before getting in a car.\nThe Kremlin, which has not mentioned Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin by name since his mutiny, has insisted that Putin has not been weakened by the rebellion.\n\"The data we have show the prevailing and dominating support of the president and the special military operation,\" Peskov said Thursday using Moscow's official term for the conflict in Ukraine.\nPutin has insisted that the mutineers did not galvanize support during their rebellion.\nHe initially condemned the rebelling Wagner fighters as traitors and vowed tough punishment but after the mutiny was halted, Putin allowed the fighters to go back to their homes, join the regular army or go into exile in Belarus.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Cats are considered lucky in Japan, and owners of the popular pets spend big on their care. But how do you know when they're feline down?\nA tech firm and university in Tokyo have teamed up to produce an app trained on thousands of cat photos that they say can tell you when puss is in pain.\nSince its release last month, \"Cat Pain Detector\" has racked up 43,000 users, mostly in Japan but also in Europe and South America, said Go Sakioka, head of developer Carelogy.\nThe app is part of a growing array of tech for pet owners concerned for their furry friends' wellbeing, including similar mood and pain trackers made in Canada and Israel.\nCarelogy teamed up with Nihon University's College of Bioresource Sciences to gather 6,000 cat photos, in which they carefully studied the positions of the animals' ears, noses, whiskers and eyelids.\nThey then used a scoring system designed by the University of Montreal to measure minute differences between healthy cats and those suffering pain due to hard-to-spot illnesses.\nNext, the app developers fed the information into an AI detection system, which has further refined its skills thanks to around 600,000 photos uploaded by users, Sakioka said.\nNow the app \"has an accuracy level of more than 90 percent\", he told AFP.\nAccording to the Japan Pet Food Association, 60 percent of owners take their cat to a veterinarian at most once a year.\n\"We want to help cat owners judge more easily at home whether to see a vet or not,\" Sakioka said.\n\"Cat Pain Detector\" is already being used by some vets in Japan, the land of Hello Kitty, where tourists flock to cat cafes and some small islands are overrun by stray felines.\nBut \"the AI system still needs to be more precise before it's used as a standardIzed tool\", he cautioned.",
