According to the UN, 95 percent of Afghans are going hungry.

The situation has only worsened since then.

          "description": "Revelations that Australia's ex-prime minister secretly appointed himself to several ministerial posts during the pandemic sparked a political firestorm Monday, with his successor promising a rapid investigation.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Scott Morrison of \"tin-pot activity\" after it emerged the former leader had made himself minister of health, finance and resources, among other positions, without informing colleagues, parliament or voters.\nDescribing Morrison's actions as \"extraordinary and unprecedented\", Albanese said Monday he had sought legal advice from the solicitor-general and would be briefed later today.\n\"This is a sort of tin-pot activity that we would ridicule if it was in a non-democratic country,\" Albanese said. \"Scott Morrison was running a shadow government\"\nIn some cases, Morrison made himself a co-minister without telling the cabinet members he had already appointed to those positions.\nThe scandal has shone a light on the opaque nature of decision-making inside Australia's government -- and raised questions about whether more stringent democratic safeguards are needed.\nIt is still not clear how many posts Morrison held, but local media reported that he took on the resources portfolio and used his power to axe a significant gas project off Sydney's coast.\nMorrison's conservative coalition lost power in May elections, ending nearly a decade of centre-right rule in the country.\nIn Australia, elected politicians are selected by the prime minister before being sworn in by the governor-general in a formal ceremony that is usually publicly recorded.\nConstitutional law expert Anne Twomey described the allegations as \"bizarre\" and said it raised possible legal challenges to some of the former government's decisions.\n\"The secrecy involved in this is just simply bizarre. I mean, you know, you just wonder what's wrong with these people, if they have to do everything in secret,\" she said.\n\"It's just utterly inappropriate. We live in a democracy, which requires transparency.\"\n¬© 2022 AFP",

The tea leaves data suggests that YoungBoy may have performed particularly well on services with free tiers like Spotify and YouTube, where YoungBoy has been a huge attraction for years.\n\n\nEven so, the deciding factor in winning No. 1 was the number of copies sold in a complete package.  Last week, the CD version of ‚ÄúUn Verano‚Äù became widely available, so the album sold 6,000 copies, while ‚ÄúThe Last Slimeto‚Äù only sold 4,600.\n‚ÄúRebirth‚Äù by Beyonc√© best seller last week, falling two places to No. 3 in its second week, with the equivalent of 89,000 sales, a drop of 73%.

And by silence, I mean, I think I‚Äôm listening a little more than 12, 13 years ago.  I don‚Äôt like to use the word witness, but that‚Äôs what comes to mind.  I think it may have affected me in that I‚Äôm a bit more patient.

And I was like, ‚ÄòNo, Mikey would never leave his granddaughter.  And of course the reasoning is that the police department ‚Äì ‚Äã‚Äãthey‚Äôre right there in the park.  They will take care of her, they will return her to her mother.  I still have trouble with Mike leaving his granddaughter in the park.\nThere‚Äôs a scene in ‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù last season where Mike reads ‚ÄúThe Little Prince‚Äù to his granddaughter, Kaylee.  It is a passage where the little prince says: ‚ÄúMy flower is ephemeral, and it has only four thorns to defend itself against the world.  What do you think this scene means for Mike?\n\nSource Link",
