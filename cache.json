          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r Advances in technology are having a major impact in the workplace, creating new roles, changing job content, and obliging everyone to acquire the skills needed to keep pace with developments in a fast-moving environment.\r \r \r \r Those circumstances no doubt explain the demand for places on the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) programme offered by City University of Hong Kong (CityU).\r \r Available in both one-year full-time and two-year part-time modes, the course is a favourite with forward-looking data analytic professionals keen to build a highly rewarding career with tech and e-commerce firms or in big data, AI and machine learning across a broad spectrum of industries.\r \r But it is also attracting applicants from fields like banking, accounting, logistics, real estate and marketing, who see that relevant expertise will enhance their standing as problem solvers, strategists and managers and open the door to all kinds of new opportunities.\r \r \r \r “As data collection technology continues to develop and becomes cheaper, companies in different sectors want to take advantage of it,” says Dr Matthias Tan, Associate Professor at CityU’s School of Data Science and Programme Leader for MSDS programme. “By analysing the data they have, they can improve decision making and overall business performance. Right now, the field is expanding very quickly in terms of methodology and data collection techniques, so I am confident that demand for data scientists will continue to grow.”\r \r As a result, each September intake for the MSDS admits around 100 students. They are expected to take five core courses and five electives to achieve a total of 30 credits. The foundational modules cover areas such as exploratory data analysis and visualisation, statistical machine learning, and storing and retrieving data. This provides strong training in key aspects of both theory and practice.\r \r The list of electives gives students scope to pick courses…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

House Bill 4293 would ban such marriages. \nThe Michigan state House passed the measure resoundingly, but GOP Reps. Steve Carra, Neil Friske, Matt Maddock, Angela Rigas and Josh Schriver all voted against the measure, Heartland Signal reports on its Twitter feed.\nSo far this century, 5,400 children (under the age of 18) were married in Michigan, but the numbers have declined steadily in recent years, the report said, noting 468 girls married in Michigan in 2000 compared to just 32 in 2021.\nDemocratic Rep. Kara Hope, one of the bill’s sponsors, said, \"It's hard to believe that this practice is still legal in Michigan in the year 2023,\" according to the report. \n\"Victims of child marriage have less stability in their financial situations, more unwanted pregnancies and worse health outcomes,\" it says.\nA United Nations initiative aims to end child marriage by 2030.",
