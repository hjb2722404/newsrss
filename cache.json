The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

The documents, which carry markings suggesting that they are highly classified, have led to a string of stories about the war in Ukraine, protests in Israel and how the U.S. surveils friend and foe alike.\nThe source of the documents is not publicly known, but reporting by the open-source investigative site Bellingcat has traced their earliest appearance to Discord, a communications platform popular with gamers.\nDiscord's statement suggested it was already in touch with investigators.\n\"In regards to the apparent breach of classified material, we are cooperating with law enforcement,\" the statement said. \"As this remains an active investigation, we cannot provide further comment at this time.\"\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\nAlthough the documents only began drawing attention recently, Bellingcat said it found evidence that at least some of the files had been floating around on social media as far back as March or even January.\nBellingcat cited Discord users who it said gave similar accounts of the documents' provenance but cautioned that it was unable to independently verify all the information they shared.\nReuters could not immediately corroborate Bellingcat's reporting; attempts to reach former members of the server via the social media site Reddit and other servers on Discord were not immediately successful.\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Josie Kao)",

And how is it possible that he was able to copy and distribute those documents for months without the Pentagon noticing? These are some of the questions raised by the arrest of Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who is suspected of being behind the largest — and most embarrassing — leak of official secrets in the US since WikiLeaks in 2010. To answer these questions, it is necessary to revisit the attacks of September 11, 2001. \nTeixeira joined the National Guard, an auxiliary military corps whose main mission is to defend the United States in the event of war, immediately after graduating from high school three years ago. Following a background check, required for entry into jobs related to national security, he received clearance for access to high-level classified information. His assignment to an intelligence unit, in which he had to ensure that communications flowed properly as an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks, gave him access to restricted areas.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Former veteran CIA officer Larry Johnson in the video below makes a very compelling case on why Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira could not have leaked some of these documents.",
