The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.\nThe clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.\n\"We decisively condemn Pristina's provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,\" Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.\n\"The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,\" she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by \"Western mediators\" had come too late.\nSerbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo's independence, and Moscow has blocked the country's bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.\n(Reporting by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Conor Humphries)",

It currently polls on par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats. \nNever before have voters in Germany been this unhappy with the current coalition government: Only one in five says they are doing a good job. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens, and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) are plummeting in the polls, after only one and a half years in office. \nThis is according to pollster infratest-dimap who surveyed 1300 eligible voters on May 30 and 31, 2023, and published the results in its monthly \"Deutschlandtrend.\" \nThe far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the main beneficiary. Its approval ratings have gone up by another 2% since May and, if elections were held now, would win 18% nationwide putting them on a par with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD. In several eastern states, the AfD has long been the strongest party.  \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Centrists alarmed as poll shows growing support for German far-right party (AP)\n \nUpdate #2: German far right surges in polls, alarming mainstream parties (Euronews)\n\n \nWNU Editor: In my lifetime I have never seen a German government this incompetent AND dangerous. \nAfter only one and a half years in office, Germany has lost its source of stable and cheap energy. Its economy, once the envy of the world, is now in a recession. There is no leadership or direction from the Chancellor's office. And to top it all off, the country is now involved in a war against Russia.\nThe AfD may be a far-right populist party. But they, and other opposition parties, in the eys of many Germans are looking very good right now.",

          "description": "Politico:  The debt deal limits Pentagon spending. Lawmakers are already figuring out ways around it. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans say a supplemental for Ukraine could be a way to pad defense spending. \nThe ink is barely dry on a debt limit deal that constrains Pentagon spending for the next two years, but lawmakers in both parties are already looking for ways to boost funding levels in spite of those caps. \n The pact passed the House late Wednesday with the support of most Republican defense hawks, even though the deal caps national defense spending at the administration’s $886 billion proposal for fiscal 2024. It’s still unclear as of Thursday afternoon how the GOP will break in the Senate. \nThat hasn’t stopped Democrats and Republicans from looking for creative ways to increase the Pentagon budget.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Senators eye Ukraine aid bills as avenue to increase DOD budget (Roll Call)\n \nUpdate #2: Senators seek to bypass defense caps in debt ceiling bill (Defense News)\n\n \nWNU Editor: The US Senate has passed the debt ceiling deal .... The Senate just passed the debt ceiling bill. Here’s what happens next (CNN). \nAs to what is my take on this \"debt deal\". \n1) $4 trillion in more debt. \n2) The debt ceiling no longer has a real ceiling. \n3) The US budget will now be normalized from $4t to $6t, with spending mostly likely to be near the $6t mark (for the next two years). \n4) This new debt will be offering 5.25% interest of which half will be used for paying interest on existing debt.  \n\n5) This is not temporary. This is their plan. \n6) The Pentagon budget will continue to grow.",

And now we are being told that this counter-offensive will be the first step not only in expelling Russian military forces in Ukraine, but also recapturing Crimea?!?!?!? \nSince the start of the war Ukraine has loss almost half of its population. 20% of its territory. An economy and government that is totally dependent on Western aid. And an army that when the war started has been decimated through attrition, and is now made up by survivors, volunteers, and conscripts, that need regular and constant Western supplies to function. \nSo yeah. There are sky-high expectations ahead of Ukraine's counteroffensive.",
