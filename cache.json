          "description": "In the world's highest mountain range, global warming threatens thousands of glaciers, resulting in increasingly frequent natural disasters: landslides, avalanches and glacier collapses. Our reporters Alban Alvarez and Navodita Kumari travelled to the small northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, where these disasters are compounded by a rush to develop infrastructure such as hydroelectric dams.\nUp in the foothills of the Himalayas, the region of Uttarakhand is getting the Indian government’s attention. The state of 10 million inhabitants, bordering both China and Nepal, has become a vast open-air building site. The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi fully intends to take advantage of the region’s geographical position to make it a hub for renewable energy. \nIndia, the world’s third-biggest carbon emitter, which gets 80 percent of its electricity from coal, is counting on the large-scale construction of hydroelectric power stations in the region to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070. Uttarakhand certainly has assets: the state is home to dozens of rivers, especially the Ganges and the Yamuna, the country’s largest waterways. But in addition to being located in a seismic zone, Uttarakhand is threatened by global warming, resulting in the accelerated melting of its glaciers. \nFor the past decade, the region has experienced natural disasters every year: landslides, avalanches, glacier collapses and even \"cloudbursts\" – sudden storms that can destroy a valley in a few minutes. In 2013, some 10,000 Hindu pilgrims died there during sudden bad weather while praying at a religious site. The bodies of almost 4,000 of them were never found.",

China has condemned the United States for allowing her to go, though her visit there is technically only a transit.\nAt the end of the trip, Tsai is expected to meet U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in Los Angeles.\nChina staged war games near Taiwan in August after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.\nVisiting an army base in Chiayi in southern Taiwan, Tsai reviewed their training, seeing them erect anti-tank barriers and practice martial arts.\n\"Protecting Taiwan and defending democracy has always been our military's great mission,\" she told the soldiers, accompanied by Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng and National Security Council Secretary-General Wellington Koo.\n\"I believe that only by continuously training and strengthening the military's war preparedness can we be even more able to protect our home and defend our country,\" Tsai added.\nTsai has repeatedly offered talks with China, but says Taiwan will defend itself if attacked and that only the island's people can decide their future.\n(Reporting by Fabian Hamacher and Carlos Garcia Rawlins; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Stephen Coates)",

          "description": "On an otherwise typical morning, one very important component of village life appeared to be missing. The proud parish of just 600, woke to find all the ‘Eggs’ in its namesake street signs and notice boards had mysteriously disappeared. The ‘Welcome to Egginton’ signs bookending the village, now read ‘Welcome to …Inton’ leading to much head scratching from passers-by. As speculation grew, Egginton began to wonder who had hidden their eggs. In a cunning move, the unsuspecting residents were then given clues to a village location so Egginton could get its ‘Eggs’ back, as Cadbury revealed it was behind the amusing activity. The self-proclaimed ‘Easter obsessed’ village, donned their Easter bonnet best and hopped at the chance to get involved in some early Easter fun. Within minutes, the entire parish (plus some curious local sheep and lambs) was gathered on mass, in search of its eggs. Egginton was led to a giant purple Cadbury Easter egg, peaking through the daffodils in a nearby open space. The generous collection was made up of hundreds of Cadbury Easter eggs – one for everyone in the village to enjoy or hide for someone special this Easter.",

(Lynsey Addario/The New York Times)   \nNew York Times: From Rockets to Ball Bearings, Pentagon Struggles to Feed War Machine \nWASHINGTON — The Navy admiral had a blunt message for the military contractors building precision-guided missiles for his warships, submarines and planes at a moment when the United States is dispatching arms to Ukraine and preparing for the possibility of conflict with China. \n“Look at me. I am not forgiving the fact you’re not delivering the ordnance we need. OK?” Adm. Daryl Caudle, who is in charge of delivering weapons to most of the Navy’s East Coast-based fleet, warned contractors during an industry gathering in January. “We’re talking about war-fighting, national security, and going against a competitor here and a potential adversary that is like nothing we’ve ever seen. And we can’t dillydally around with these deliveries.” \nHis open frustration reflects a problem that has become worryingly apparent as the Pentagon dispatches its own stocks of weapons to help Ukraine hold off Russia and Washington warily watches for signs that China might provoke a new conflict by invading Taiwan: The United States lacks the capacity to produce the arms that the nation and its allies need at a time of heightened superpower tensions.   \nRead more ....    \nWNU Editor: If the US Department of Defense is having supply chain problems.

The United States and Soviet troops shook hands over the waters of the Elbe River on April 25, 1945. That water is now poisoned. \nA recent Gallup poll reveals the depth of the negative feeling:       \nAmericans’ already-negative opinions of Russia have soured further in the past year, dropping from 15% holding a favorable view to 9%. The current reading for Russia is the lowest Gallup has measured since it first asked about the “Soviet Union” in this format in 1989. \n Russia is now the fourth country in Gallup’s polling of country favorable ratings to register a sub-10% favorable score. Iran, Iraq and North Korea have had ratings below 10% on multiple occasions. The all-time low favorable rating for any country was 3% for Iraq in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War.  \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: The only prominent US political leader that is talking about the need to find a quick and peaceful end to the Ukraine war is former President Trump.
