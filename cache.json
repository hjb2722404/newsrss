Their usual venue, an ornate 450-seater hall, has been closed due to the six-month war that has seen Mykolaiv, a strategic southern port, repeatedly targeted by Russia forces.\n\"Of course, many plays have been cancelled, because some male actors went away to fight, some went abroad as temporary refugees. So, our theatre company has become smaller,\" said actress Violeta Mamykina, speaking in her cramped dressing room before going on stage.\nTheatre manager Artem Svystun described the performance as \"art-therapy\", giving local people who have stayed on in the city some brief respite from the stress of the war.\nIevhen Studzinskyi, who was in the audience for Thursday night's show, agreed.\n\"When I went outside, I said it plain and simple, 'it was fun',\" he said. \"There were tears. There was food for thought. There was a philosophy, depth. I felt really good.\"\n(Reporting by Umit Bektas; Writing by Andrii Pryimachenko and Alex Richardson; Editing by Alison Williams)",

But on August 26, 1942, he was powerless to prevent the roundup of the city’s Jews. “There weren’t any Germans in Lyon; the French police did everything – and that made it especially frightening,” Nodot recounted to the France 3 television station in 1992.\n“The authorities would turn up at people’s homes and say ‘Open up - police!’ They had people’s addresses; they had lists of names,” Nodot said. “They took people straight away, just as they were.”\nThe Vél d’Hiv roundup –…",

          "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was banned by a court on Thursday from attending public events or using the internet for five weeks after he was charged with discrediting the armed forces, Interfax news agency reported.\nRoizman, an outspoken supporter of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and opponent of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, was also barred until Sept. 29 from communicating without permission with anyone except his lawyer and relatives.\nThe court declined prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest and ordered him released from detention.\nRoizman denies all the charges.\nOn Wednesday, Russian media published videos showing Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by masked men in camouflage uniform. He told reporters as he was led away that he was being investigated for using the words \"war\" and \"invasion\" to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine.\nRussia says it is conducting a \"special military operation\" there. The offence of discrediting the military, newly introduced after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, carries a prison sentence of up to five years.\nState news agency TASS reported that investigators said the case was based on a YouTube video Roizman had uploaded.\nRoizman, a popular figure both in Yekaterinburg and nationally, was elected mayor of Russia's fourth largest city in 2013, amid a wave of protest against Vladimir Putin's decision to run for a third term as Russian president. Roizman resigned in 2018, after local lawmakers voted to abolish his office in what Roizman described as a politically motivated move against him.\n(Reporting by Reuters; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike.\n\"I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine,\" Denise Brown, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement.\n\"Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or traveling with their families.\"\nBrown said the human toll of the attack was \"just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine.\"\nShe cited other attacks that also killed civilians, as well as intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, that had damaged houses, schools, shops and pharmacies, and underscored the need to protect civilians.\n\"All actors, without exception, must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure so that they are protected, their houses preserved, and essential services remain,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Catherine Evans and Richard Chang)",

I was held in the Hampshire County Jail, so I know the three candidates for the position of sheriff very well. \nI choose to endorse Mrs. Yvonne Gittelson for sheriff.  She’s the best candidate because of what I saw her do while I was incarcerated.  She was a highly respected person among staff and the prison population because of her passion for her work, the respect she showed us and the trust she had in us, as well as the challenges she gave us. \nI’ve seen her with hard-core criminals with no security personnel, just cameras, and she’s never scared, which makes the inmates and staff respect her.  She is dedicated to charting a positive course for everyone she works with. \nI sincerely believe that Mrs. Yvonne is the answer to the change that must be brought to the prison.  I saw her pushing for inmate education when she had little help.  She helped me get my Hi-SET (GED) while I was there, and I’m proud to show my son that I finally got there. \nShe wanted remand inmates to be able to get an education instead of sitting around doing nothing.  I’ve been sober for over 24 months today and it’s thanks to the pills she gave us.  The addiction programs offered on the tablet have helped me a lot. \nThe things she accomplished were nothing short of a miracle with many inmates.  I hope everyone takes the time to get to know this woman like I do.  We need a nurturing but firm female sheriff, and that’s Mrs. Yvonne.\nKeith Pontbriand\nItems\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {   var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];   if (d.getElementById(id)) return;   js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;   js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=833431040023870\";   fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nSource link",

          "description": "Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has updated its information related to Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake to include any forks that may occur.\nIn a Thursday update to an Aug. 16 blog post, Coinbase said it would assess all potential forks in the Ethereum blockchain on a case-by-case basis.” The crypto exchange previously said that he planned to ‘briefly pause’ Ether(ETH) and deposits and withdrawals of ERC-20 tokens during the merger, which are expected to take place between September 10 and September 20.\n“Should an ETH PoW fork occur after The Merge, this asset will be reviewed with the same rigor as any other asset listed on our exchange,” Coinbase said.\n\nRest assured that all potential Ethereum forked tokens, including PoW forks, will go through the same strict listing review process that is performed for any other asset listed on our exchange.\n— Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) August 25, 2022\n\nExchanges and crypto companies dealing with ETH have made announcements informing customers of all the preparations needed before the merger, from proof of work, or PoW, to proof of stake, or PoS.  Many expect blockchain power consumption to drop precipitously, scalability to improve, and the network to be less vulnerable to attack.\nIt is unclear how crypto users might respond to a forked PoW token listed on Coinbase or any crypto exchange during Ethereum transitions.  Wednesday, the platform launched an ERC-20 token which will allow customers to use staked ETH while earning rewards, cbETH.\nRelated: The quadruple bug bounty for the Ethereum network – Up to $1 million in payouts before the merger\nBinance too said On Thursday, it might offer support for new tokens created by a potential hard fork but would “guarantee no listings” without a review process.  BitMEX made a similar announcement on August 8, adding that the offer was “highly speculative” and “may never exist”.\n\n\n\nSource Link",

Two things that point to the notion that Washington is supporting a long war in Ukraine, and truly doesn’t think there will be a diplomatic solution or cessation of violence there anytime soon: one, the $3 billion in recently announced military transfers is a “multi-year military investment” including weapons that won’t be available via defense contractors for at least three years. \nSecondly, a little nugget dropped on us Wednesday night: Biden plans on “naming ” the U.S. military assistance mission in Ukraine and making it a separate command with its own general. You know, like Operation Desert Storm, Operation Gothic Serpent, Operation Uphold Democracy, or Operation Unified Protector. We can expect the name, when it comes, will be heavy on the righteous benefactor angle, softer on the sword. But it is nevertheless a military operation, and that carries with it some practical, and serious implications. From WSJ: \nRead more .... \n WNU Editor: The US is signaling to everyone that the Ukraine war is going to be a long one.",

American military aircraft struck Iran-backed militia targets in eastern Syria for the third day in a row on Thursday as commanders sought to suppress a new flurry of attacks on US bases in the country. \nThe US deployed Apache helicopters, AC-130 gunships and M777 artillery in response to rocket fire that lightly injured three US soldiers at the Conoco base in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province around 7:20 p.m. on Wednesday. At least two additional rockets later landed outside the United States' Green Village base at al-Omar oilfield. \nThe military’s response has killed four “enemy fighters” and destroyed seven rocket launchers, US Central Command said today. The command called the retaliation “proportional and deliberate” in a statement last night. \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: US Launches More Airstrikes in Syria, Says Four Killed (Antiwar.com)   \nWNU Editor: These airstrikes are not going to stop these militias from attacking US targets in Syria.",
