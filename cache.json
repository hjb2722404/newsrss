Usually we are aware of ports in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and France,\" said El Callao's police chief, Colonel Luis Angel Bolanos.\nAt a press conference Monday, police displayed the cocaine, which had been fixed to rubber sheets to appear as hundreds of ceramic tiles packed in wooden boxes inside a shipping container.\nBolanos said the seized cocaine was valued at \"at least $20 million.\"\nThe Andean nation seized a record 86.4 tonnes of drugs and illicit substances last year, 28 tonnes of which were cocaine hydrochloride, police data shows.\nPeru and nearby Colombia are among the top global producers of cocaine and of the coca leaf it is made of, according to the United Nations.\n(Reporting by Anthony Marina and Alfredo Galarza; Writing by Brendan O'Boyle; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

          "description": "On an otherwise typical morning, one very important component of village life appeared to be missing. The proud parish of just 600, woke to find all the ‘Eggs’ in its namesake street signs and notice boards had mysteriously disappeared. The ‘Welcome to Egginton’ signs bookending the village, now read ‘Welcome to …Inton’ leading to much head scratching from passers-by. As speculation grew, Egginton began to wonder who had hidden their eggs. In a cunning move, the unsuspecting residents were then given clues to a village location so Egginton could get its ‘Eggs’ back, as Cadbury revealed it was behind the amusing activity. The self-proclaimed ‘Easter obsessed’ village, donned their Easter bonnet best and hopped at the chance to get involved in some early Easter fun. Within minutes, the entire parish (plus some curious local sheep and lambs) was gathered on mass, in search of its eggs. Egginton was led to a giant purple Cadbury Easter egg, peaking through the daffodils in a nearby open space. The generous collection was made up of hundreds of Cadbury Easter eggs – one for everyone in the village to enjoy or hide for someone special this Easter.",

(Lynsey Addario/The New York Times)   \nNew York Times: From Rockets to Ball Bearings, Pentagon Struggles to Feed War Machine \nWASHINGTON — The Navy admiral had a blunt message for the military contractors building precision-guided missiles for his warships, submarines and planes at a moment when the United States is dispatching arms to Ukraine and preparing for the possibility of conflict with China. \n“Look at me. I am not forgiving the fact you’re not delivering the ordnance we need. OK?” Adm. Daryl Caudle, who is in charge of delivering weapons to most of the Navy’s East Coast-based fleet, warned contractors during an industry gathering in January. “We’re talking about war-fighting, national security, and going against a competitor here and a potential adversary that is like nothing we’ve ever seen. And we can’t dillydally around with these deliveries.” \nHis open frustration reflects a problem that has become worryingly apparent as the Pentagon dispatches its own stocks of weapons to help Ukraine hold off Russia and Washington warily watches for signs that China might provoke a new conflict by invading Taiwan: The United States lacks the capacity to produce the arms that the nation and its allies need at a time of heightened superpower tensions.   \nRead more ....    \nWNU Editor: If the US Department of Defense is having supply chain problems.

The United States and Soviet troops shook hands over the waters of the Elbe River on April 25, 1945. That water is now poisoned. \nA recent Gallup poll reveals the depth of the negative feeling:       \nAmericans’ already-negative opinions of Russia have soured further in the past year, dropping from 15% holding a favorable view to 9%. The current reading for Russia is the lowest Gallup has measured since it first asked about the “Soviet Union” in this format in 1989. \n Russia is now the fourth country in Gallup’s polling of country favorable ratings to register a sub-10% favorable score. Iran, Iraq and North Korea have had ratings below 10% on multiple occasions. The all-time low favorable rating for any country was 3% for Iraq in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War.  \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: The only prominent US political leader that is talking about the need to find a quick and peaceful end to the Ukraine war is former President Trump.
