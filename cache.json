          "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.\nBiden on Thursday insisted he was \"doing great\", and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.\n\"I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery,\" Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.\nIt is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.\nThe pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.\nThe leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.\nEarlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the \"next ten days\", weeks after both countries' top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.\nBeijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.\nPelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: \"Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese.\"",

Along the route where he rides his bike several times a week in Lenexa, another Kansas City suburb, more and more road signs have appeared on either side of the issue.\n“It brought everything to the fore,” said Markert, who was retired from the mortgage industry and who said his opposition to abortion in almost all cases was motivated by his Christian faith.  “If Roe vs. Wade wouldn’t have been upset, I think ‘Vote Yes’ would have been ‘more likely to win.  He added: “I don’t know if it’s now.”\nAs Election Day approached, the rhetoric heated up.  Campaign placards on both sides have been stolen or destroyed, according to police and organizers.  In the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, vandals target a Catholic church this month, splashing buildings and a statue of Mary with red paint, an episode that police have linked to the abortion debate.\nTwice in the past few weeks someone tore down signs supporting the amendment at Faith Baptist Church in Salina, Kansas, pastor Jesse Rowland said.  A third sign has been placed in the cemetery.\n“It’s a bit more of trench warfare – everyone is entrenched on one side or the other,” Mr Rowland said.  “No one is talking, really, from what I’ve observed.”\n\nSource Link",

But he has two virtual meetings on his Monday public schedule.  During the lunch hour, he will deliver a video address at the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives conference.\n\n\nLater in the afternoon, he will participate in a meeting in a complex White House auditorium led by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo with business and labor leaders to discuss the Chip Act, a legislation providing subsidies and tax credits to companies that manufacture semiconductors in the United States.  states.  The Senate plans to hold a key test vote on the legislation later today.\n\n\nThe White House has not determined when Mr. Biden will be allowed to return to his duties in person while he waits to test negative.  Dr. O’Connor reiterated that “he will continue to self-isolate in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations” and added that he is “very particularly conscientious in protecting one of the executive residences, the White House, the Secret Service, and other personnel whose duties require close (albeit socially distanced) proximity to him.\n\nSource Link",

While fielding a question about the value of morality in tech, Schmidt explained that he, himself, had been naive about the power of information in the early days of Google. He then called for tech to be better in line with the ethics and morals of the people it serves and made a bizarre comparison between AI and nuclear weapons.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: US must seek international cyberspace norms with China, Russia: experts (FOX News).   \nWNU Editor: I like to believe that we are still years (if not decades) away from developing systems that exhibit AI.
