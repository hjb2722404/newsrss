The missile strikes, the most widespread since the start of the invasion, prompted President Joe Biden to boost US support to Ukraine, offering “advanced air defense systems” in a call to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said the strikes indicated a “profound change” in the nature of the war. The explosions came as the UN General Assembly was set to open debate on a draft resolution condemning Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Read about the day's events as they unfolded on our liveblog below. All times are Paris time (GMT + 2).",

As the war continues to escalate in Ukraine, we feature an interview recorded earlier this month with world-renowned political dissident Noam Chomsky in Brazil and political writer Vijay Prashad. Chomsky discusses why he thinks there is no major U.S. peace movement in response to the Ukraine war, and talks about the dangerous U.S. Senate policy on China and Taiwan, which he says, along with Ukraine, could end in a “terminal war.” Prashad also examines the destruction wrought in the Global South by Western so-called humanitarian invasion in the name of demo…",
