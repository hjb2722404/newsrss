The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Prosecutors allege that the firm invoiced UMP rather than the campaign. They say Sarkozy spent 42.8 million euros on his 2012 campaign, almost double the permitted amount.\n(Reuters)",

However, after the GOP won control of the House in 2022, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rescinded this policy.\nThe impeachment of Mayorkas, in which Republicans have remained vague about what high crimes or misdemeanors they are actually accusing him of, is expected to fail at trial in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
