          "description": "A fire in an informal immigrant neighborhood in Coronel, Chile, resulted in the death of 14 individuals, most of whom were children. The victims are believed to be undocumented Venezuelan immigrants who had recently arrived in the area. The cause of the fire is still being determined, but preliminary reports suggest that it may have been sparked by a fire from a handmade stove. Chilean President Gabriel Boric expressed his condolences and called for reflection on how society treats immigrants.",

Many global community members criticized Israel's response to the recent Hamas attack, accusing them of excessive force and even genocide. Bennett argued that Israel is held to a different standard and posed a hypothetical scenario to highlight this point. He opposed a two-state solution and claimed that Israel had previously given Gaza to the Palestinians, but they used it to attack Israel instead.",

By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "Speaking to FRANCE 24 one month after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Mohammad Shtayyeh, prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, called for \"an immediate ceasefire\" in Gaza, but said that \"the Israelis don't want any ceasefire because today the Israelis are in the mood of revenge\". Shtayyeh argued that Israel's goal of eliminating Hamas \"is totally not going to happen\", and called for a \"comprehensive solution\" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as an \"international intervention to put serious pressure on Israel\". Finally, he said he would like to see \"general elections\" held for the Palestinians.",

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). \nThe news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",

But given the demand for the carrier air wing and delays to the Nimitz-class replacement—the Ford-class—the USS Nimitz (CVN 68) itself is unlikely to retire as soon as expected. \nThe Navy’s fiscal 2023 budget has already called to extend the first-in-class CVN 68, commissioned in 1975, for another deployment cycle instead of decommissioning it in 2025 as previously planned. Service officials say the upcoming budget request could include a final decision on extending the next in the class, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, beyond its 2027 projected end-of-service date—though extending just that ship likely will not be enough. \n Read more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The US Navy is also looking to speed-up production of future aircraft carriers ....
