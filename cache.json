          "description": "Annexation 'vote'\nNuclear threat\n\n\t\tThe integration of the war-scarred regions into Russia would represent a major escalation of the conflict, as Moscow could then try to say it was defending its own territory from Ukrainian forces.\n\t\n\n\t\tAfter the votes were announced by his proxy officials in Ukraine, Putin announced that Russia would call up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort and cautioned that Moscow would use \"all means\" to protect its territory.\n\t\n\n\t\tFormer Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said in a statement on social media that those means included \"strategic nuclear weapons\". He predicted the voting regions \"will integrate into Russia\".\n\t\n\n\t\tFor most observers, the results of the concurrent votes are already a foregone conclusion and were rushed because Ukrainian forces were making sweeping gains in a counter-offensive to recapture the east.\n\t\n\n\t\tThe referendums are reminiscent of a similar ballot in 2014 that saw the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine annexed by Russia. Western capitals said the vote was fraudulent and hit Moscow with sanctions in response.\n\t\n\n\t\tElection officials in the Donetsk region, partially controlled since 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists, said voting would take place door-to-door for the first days. But it would only be possible in polling stations on the final day, Tuesday.",

          "description": "Interfax-Ukraine: Putin seeks to restore USSR, death of people is part of plan – Zelensky in interview with Alain Delon \nVladimir Putin wants the restoration of the USSR, and people are only expendable material for him, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with famous French actor Alain Delon, shown on the air of the telethon. \n\"He [Putin] understands perfectly well what he is doing. He knows how many people are dying. But for him this is an integral part of the plan,\" Zelensky said. \nAt the same time, he believes that Putin has made the majority of the nation believe in what he is doing. \n\"There are social networks. We understand how people react. Many have been brainwashed by the information war, dirty information. Many have gone crazy and rejoice when they kill us. It looks scary,\" Zelensky said.\nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Unfortunately you have to click on the above video to go to Youtube to watch it. It is also in French, and there is no close-captions or translation. \nFortunately I speak French, and while it is a repeat of what he has been saying for the past few weeks, Zelensky did mention 2 important points. One .... he was \"shocked\" at Israel’s lack of support, and (2) he remarked that Ukraine is losing 50 soldiers a day. \nThis is a hard to believe number, especially when Zelensky himself admitted a few months ago that Ukraine was losing 60 - 100 soldiers a day .... President Zelensky Says 60-100 Ukrainian Soldiers Are Being Killed Per Day And Around 500 Wounded (June 1, 2022), and his top aid admitted losses between 100 - 200 soldiers a day .... Senior Aide to President Zelensky Says Ukraine Is Losing 100 - 200 Soldiers Each Day (June 10, 2-22). My sources in Ukraine tell me that the number runs in the hundreds per day.",
