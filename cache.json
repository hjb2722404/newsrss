They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.\nAbdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.\n\nHe told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.\nSix years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.\n\"Evil did not win,\" he said. \"You can't kill rock and roll.\"\n(REUTERS)",

All of that, to put it mildly, is false.\"\nREAD MORE: Liz Cheney is 'more aggressive than even some Democrats in wanting to go directly after Trump': report\nKhodaryonok noted that the United States shipments of advanced military weapons to Ukraine is being effective in helping the country defend itself against the Russian onslaught, \"despite the resistance of a single senator.\" Kentucky Republican Rand Paul last week blocked Senate consideration of a new U.S. aid package to Ukraine.\n\"A million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future,\" Khodaryonok said. \"and we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us frankly will get worse.\"\nWatch the defense analyst's entire take on the Russian war effort below or at this link.\n\nIn an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation.

Most free throws, almost 80% of them, are successful.  So why bother boxing?\nAnd then there’s Miami’s PJ Tucker, a 6-foot-5, 245-pound wrecking ball who spent his career disguised as a power forward.

Tucker took advantage of that window to throw most of his body weight into the midsection of Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics.\nIt was a bit much.  One of the referees advised Tucker to cool him down, which he didn’t like.  But that wasn’t going to stop Tucker from playing the only way he knew how to play – hard – …",

He was named one of three finalists for the Hart Trophy for most valuable player of the regular season and is almost guaranteed to receive the Vézina Trophy for top goaltender.  All voters needed was his .935 save percentage and 2.07 goals-against average, both league-best.\nShesterkin, 26, was drafted out of Russia by Rangers in the fourth round of the 2014 draft and fit right into a line of Rangers goalkeepers dating back to the early 1990s with Mike Richter, who was followed , two years after his own retirement.  , by Henrik Lundqvist in 2005.\n“What a series of goaltenders we’ve seen here with the Rangers,” said Eddie Olczyk, a TNT analyst and Richter’s teammate on the last Rangers team to win a Stanley Cup, in 1994. It hasn’t been a problem for Rangers, and when you have it, you have a chance to win every night.\nOlczyk said he spoke to Gallant months ago about Shesterkin, and the coach praised him for the goalkeeper’s incredible ability to read, react and get in the right position before the shot or the pass.\n“I don’t think you hear that very often,” Olczyk said.  “He seems to know what’s going to happen first.  When this happens, you are playing five card stud with six cards.  It’s a very good hand to play with.\nLundqvist was like that too.  He was still a Ranger when Shesterkin made his debut on January 7, 2020. Shesterkin spoke very little English then, and it was difficult for Lundqvist to communicate with him in a casual and thorough manner to get a sense of who Shesterkin was.  .  But he noticed his new team-mate was rather relaxed and chatty with other Russian-speaking Rangers players, like Pavel Buchnevich and Vladislav Namestnikov, both of whom are no longer with the team.\nNow a Rangers analyst on the MSG Network, Lundqvist says Shesterkin’s laid-back demeanor was key to the Russian goalkeeper’s ability to withstand pressure and failure – what little he had of it.\n\nSource Link",

Today, in addition to demographic trends that have long eroded the size of rural Iowa school populations, diminishing funding, the district is grappling with inflation as the price of fuel for school buses has soared in arrow, Mr. Lutt said.\nIn some states where schools have avoided distance learning — Florida, for example — enrollment has not only rebounded, but remains robust. Analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank, concluded last month that distance education was a major driver nationwide, with enrollment declining the most in districts most likely to have delayed their return to classrooms in person.\nPrivate schools also recorded enrollment gains.  Federal enrollment counts have yet to be released, but the National Association of Independent Schools and the National Catholic Educational Association have reported increases totaling about 73,000 K-12 students over the past two years.\nAt the same time, some families are leaving their local public schools not because they are dropping out of the system altogether, but because they have moved to other parts of the country that are more affordable.\nEnrollment also increased in rural resort areasdriven by the relocation of tech workers and others able to work remotely, especially after the pandemic took hold.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "BAGDOLI, India — A health worker was making her daily rounds in a village in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan when the husband of a woman suffering from nagging labor rushed towards her.\nFor months, the health worker, Bhanwar Bai Jadoun, had advised the woman to give birth in the hospital.  But the woman’s mother-in-law insisted on giving birth at home with the help of a local midwife.\nNow complications had set in.  Mrs. Jadoun suggested taking the woman urgently to a hospital 10 miles from the village, Bagdoli;  she would notify the doctors there.  An auto rickshaw was arranged.  Both mother and baby were saved.\n“When people see me every day, they know they can trust me,” Ms Jadoun said.  “They see me as their guide to healthy living.”\n\n\nFor the past two decades, a government progra…",

Poll after poll shows the 96-year-old Queen who has battled some recent health issues is widely respected by Canadians.\nHowever, for several years an ever-decreasing number of Canadians, according to polls, have wanted to swear allegiance to another British monarch, in particular Charles, who is hated by many here and who represents an…",
