          "description": "Thomas Peter / Reuters   \nMichael Schuman, The Atlantic: Why Xi Wants Trump to Win \nAfter four years of Joe Biden, China’s leaders would likely be relieved to have Donald Trump back in the White House. \nCompared with his predecessor, Biden has operated quietly. Trump launched a trade war; slapped tariffs on Chinese imports; and infuriated Beijing by referring to the coronavirus as “the Chinese Virus,” blaming the Chinese Communist Party for its spread, and even at times humoring theories that the party may have played a role in its creation. \nBut Biden has hit China harder than Trump ever did. Armed with a more determined foreign policy, he has inflicted acute damage on the country’s economy and geopolitical ambitions, from which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has struggled to recover. “A Biden-led U.S., probably from the Chinese perspective, looks like a more formidable challenge,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., told me.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Both Michael Schuman and The Atlantic are long time opponents of former President Trump while also being vocal supporters of President Biden. They do not disappoint in the above post. \nAs to what is my take. \nOne of the major cornerstones of U.S. foreign policy since Nixon's trip to China in 1973 was to go to great lengths to make sure that the Soviet Union (Russia) and China never formed a political/economic/military alliance. To do so would present a clear geopolitical threat to long term US strategic national interests. \nSighhhh ....\nFor the past 50 years this has been the policy. No more now. I can now say with confidence that the Biden administration has successfully blown-up this U.S. foreign policy priority. \nBottom line. \nA President Trump is not going to change this new political/international reality. And if Biden is re-elected, it will probably accelerate it even further. In both situations President Xi is the winner, and  Xi knows that.",
