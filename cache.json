          "description": "Cuba's embassy in Washington was attacked by a man using two Molotov cocktails on Sunday night, the country's foreign minister said, describing the incident as a \"terrorist attack\".\n\"The Cuban embassy in the US was the target of a terrorist attack by an individual who launched 2 Molotov cocktails. The staff suffered no harm,\" said Bruno Rodriguez in a post on social media platform X.\nThis was the second attack against the Cuban mission in Washington in recent years, after a man opened fire on the building in April 2020. There were no injuries from that attack. \nThe Sunday night attack took place hours after Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel returned to Havana after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York and other activities with Cubans in the US.\nIn New York, there had been demonstrations by Cubans resident in the United States against Diaz-Canel's presence at the UN, according to posts and videos shared on social media.\n\"The anti-Cuban groups resort to terrorism when feeling they enjoy impunity, something that Cuba has repeatedly warned the US authorities about,\" said Rodriguez after Sunday's attack.\nIn April 2020, the Cuban foreign minister summoned the then US charge d'affaires in Havana, Mara Tekach, to express his \"energetic protest\" over what he called a \"terrorist aggression\" against his embassy.\nThat shooting left bullet holes in exterior walls and columns, broke a street lamp and damaged several panes of glass and moldings on the front of the building. \nUS authorities arrested Alexander Alazo, then 42, for the attack.\nAlazo was indicted in July 2020 and charged with multiple offences, including \"violent attack on a foreign official or official premises using a deadly weapon\", according to the US Justice Department. \n© Agence France-Presse\nuscuba",

          "description": "A Pablo Picasso masterpiece expected to fetch at least $120 million at auction went on show Monday in Dubai, kicking off a set of rare viewings outside the United States.\nThe 1932 portrait of Marie-Therese Walter, Picasso's mistress and \"golden muse\", is being exhibited for two days before heading to Hong Kong and London, a boon for the United Arab Emirates' bid to establish itself as a cultural powerhouse.\nThe viewing \"marks the first time a painting of this calibre by the world-renowned artist has ever been exhibited in the UAE\", Sotheby's Dubai said in a statement, noting it is the first time the portrait had been shown outside the US in half a century.\n\"Over the years the UAE has earned the status of being a global art destination, which receives a further boost as this rare Picasso is unveiled here,\" said UAE Culture Minister Sheikh Salem bin Khalid al-Qassimi.\nThe painting titled \"Femme a la montre\" will be sold in November as part of a two-day auction of late New Yorker Emily Fisher Landau's prestigious collection.\nWalter met Picasso in Paris in 1927, when the Spaniard was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova, and while Walter was 17.\nWalter, whose daughter with Picasso passed away last year, was also featured in \"Femme assise pres d'une fenetre (Marie-Therese)\", which sold in 2021 for $103.4 million by Christie's auction house.\nFifty years after his death in 1973 at age 91, Picasso remains one of the most influential artists of the modern world, often hailed as a dynamic and creative genius.\nBut in the wake of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault, the reputation of this workaholic with a vast output of paintings, sketches and sculpture has been tarnished by accusations he exerted a violent hold over the women who shared his life and inspired his art.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "A British nurse jailed for life for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six others will face a retrial on an outstanding charge of attempted murder, prosecutors said on Monday.\nLucy Letby, 33, was convicted last month of killing five baby boys and two baby girls, making her Britain's most prolific child serial killer in modern times.\nBut the jury in the months-long trial at Manchester Crown Court were unable to reach decisions on six counts of attempted murder relating to five babies.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which brings prosecutions in England and Wales, said it will seek a retrial on a charge that Letby attempted to murder a baby girl in February 2016.\nA provisional trial date has been fixed for June 10 next year, also at Manchester Crown Court in northwest England.\nJonathan Storer, chief crown prosecutor with the CPS, said the decisions on whether to seek retrials were \"extremely complex and difficult\".\n\"Before reaching our conclusions, we listened carefully to the views of the families affected, police and prosecution counsel,\" he said.\n\"Many competing factors were considered, including the evidence heard by the court during the long trial and its impact on our legal test for proceeding with a prosecution,\" he added.\nLetby was arrested following a string of deaths at the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England between June 2015 and June 2016.\nShe consistently denied all the charges against her.\nLetby attended Monday's hearing via videolink from a conference room at a prison near Wakefield, northern England.\nSitting behind a desk, she only spoke to confirm her name and that she could see and hear the proceedings.\n© 2023 AFP",
