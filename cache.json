The decision to bring back Cameron and fire interior minister Suella Braverman, a prominent supporter of leaving the EU, has been seen as a risky strategy. Sunak has been trying to keep all wings of the party happy and portray himself as a tough decision-maker. However, the party still lags behind Labour in the polls.",

          "description": "The government of El Salvador has implemented a $1,130 fee on travelers from African countries and India who connect through the nation's main airport. While the fee is described as an \"airport improvement fee,\" it comes amid US pressure to control migration flows to its southern border. The measure is believed to be aimed at reducing migration, particularly to Nicaragua, a transit point for migrants from Haiti, Cuba, and Africa trying to reach the US. The move could potentially benefit El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's reelection campaign, despite criticism of his human rights record.",

Fadeyeva, who used to run Navalny's office in Tomsk, has been charged with running an extremist group and promoting activities that infringe on people's rights. This is part of an ongoing crackdown. Navalny himself was convicted earlier this year on extremism charges and sentenced to 19 years in prison.",

Strickland,\" the Vatican said in a statement.\nIt said the bishop of Austin, Joe Vasquez, had been named as apostolic administrator of the diocese, but gave no further details.\nThe Vatican has not said what sparked the apostolic visitation this summer -- which Strickland himself made public -- or what conclusions were drawn.\nBut Strickland, appointed by former pope Benedict XVI in 2012, was one of the most prominent critics of Pope Francis.\nThe Argentine pope, 86, has sought to forge a more compassionate Church, open to different views.\nBut he has faced intense opposition from critics -- particularly in the United States -- who accused him of causing confusion and failing to uphold key Catholic beliefs.\nIn a message earlier this year on X, formerly Twitter, Strickland accused the pope of \"undermining the deposit of faith\".\nIn a blog posted on his website in September, the bishop addressed rumours that he was being encouraged by the Vatican to step down.\n\"I cannot resign as bishop of Tyler because that would be me abandoning the flock\" under his care, he wrote.\n\"I have also said that I will respect the authority of Pope Francis if he removes me from office as Bishop of Tyler,\" he wrote.\n\"I love Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church which He established. My only desire is to speak His Truth and live God's Will to the best of my ability,\" he wrote.\nThe diocese of Tyler on Saturday announced the Vatican's decision to dismiss the bishop on its website, saying: \"Our work as the Catholic Church in northeast Texas continues.\"\n© 2023 AFP",

Dan Goldman (D-NY) is enraged by this, issuing a statement accusing the Republican chairman of abusing his power to harass the family of a terror victim.\n\"In the clearest sign yet of House Republicans' devious and distorted priorities, Chairman Comer has decided to subpoena a private American citizen whose 3-year-old niece is currently being held hostage in Gaza by the terrorist group Hamas,\" said Goldman. \"Despite no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, House Republicans are spending their time attacking the grieving family of a Hamas hostage rather than working to get that hostage released.\"\n\"Chairman Comer's behavior is disgusting,\" continued Goldman. \"In his soulless desperation to smear President Biden ahead of the 2024 election, he has stooped to an entirely new low of abandoning the American families of hostages in a pathetic attempt to score political points against President Biden. In this trying time at home and around the world, the American people cannot tolerate this wild goose chase anymore. It must stop immediately.\"\nComer has spent months trying to look for solid evidence that the president has been laundering bribes through his son's international business deals. No such evidence has yet emerged, and many of their hearings with Hunter Biden's business associates have if anything provided evidence of the opposite.\nThe investigation has been folded into a broader impeachment inquiry into the president, which as of now has not actually formulated a theory of charges against him.",

The six vehicles, carrying soldiers and air defense missile launchers, made their way slowly through wooded areas, across fields, and down rural tracks, looking to avoid detection by the enemy. Progress was slow. Vehicles got bogged down on more than one occasion, and we struggled to navigate using night vision equipment whilst trying to relate paper maps to the silhouettes of hills and trees. After several hours, we arrived at the battlegroup headquarters to which we were assigned.\nThe post And You Are?

          "description": "Xi and Biden meet amid a fracturing world order © Kevin Lamarque/Reuters \n Ishaan Tharoor, Washington Post: Xi and Biden meet amid a fracturing world order \n There’s a lot riding on the meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two convene at a summit of Pacific rim nations on Wednesday. Both leaders will face each other after months of tensions and anticipation. There have been angry barbs tossed over the future of Taiwan and stealthy balloons sent over the North American landmass. Beijing fulminates over a legacy of U.S. global “hegemony” and styles itself as a champion of a different kind of international order. The Biden administration, much like its right-wing predecessor, sees a rising China as the main 21st-century challenge to the United States on the world stage, and has sought to organize both its domestic and international agendas in response. \n\n \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: I have a different take from the above Washington Post article. I personally think Chinese President Xi made the decision to go to San Francisco to meet Biden, albeit on the sidelines, to gauge if there has been any change in US thinking and policy since he last talked with the US President. It is one thing to see and read on the news and listen to one's subordinates on what is the status of U.S. - Chinese relations, it is a whole different level when the leaders meet. \nAs to what both sides expect. On the U.S. side the White House has been very clear on what they want (link here). But this is not what Beijing is focused on. Their focus is on issues like Taiwan and trade, and they certainly want the U.S. to back-off as China continues to become a global player while deepening ties with countries that the U.S. is in conflict with (i.e. Russia and Iran). \nMy prediction. \nNothing is going to change from today's meetings. On the big issues the two sides have no common ground.",
