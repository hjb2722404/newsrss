The Russian authorities were not supporting the event. The attack occurred after a Hamas delegation visited Moscow. The rioters overran the airport, searching for Israeli passengers, and made threats against Jews. The incident is expected to strain diplomatic relations between Russia and Israel. The airport will remain closed until November 6.",
