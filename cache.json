John Kasich about the latest developments from the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nKasich also served nine terms in Congress, rising to chair the Budget Committee before he vacated his seat to unsuccessfully run for president in 2000.\n\"Gov. Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?\" Blitzer asked.\n \"Oh yeah. he's taking on water,\" Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.\n\"And he's shrinking,\" he continued. \"You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting.\"\n\"And I feel that he's melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, 'You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.' The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman's testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath,\" he said. \"If they don't agree with her story, with what she's been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath.\"\n\"The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It's hard for me to believe in our country we would've had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much.

The obstacle continues to be the inability to obtain enough computer chips to complete the vehicles.\nFor now, at least, consumers are still eager to buy.  Manufacturers are selling virtually every car or truck they make and have seen no signs of inventory building up at dealerships, even as new vehicle prices hit record highs.\n\n\n“It tells me that vehicles are always on the move, and that’s probably the number 1 thing I look at,” Paul Jacobson, Gener…",

State.  A spokeswoman for Walmart, which has 1.7 million employees in the United States, said the company regularly reviews its benefits based on employee demand, and that the company is “now reviewing the evolution federal and state landscape” when considering its offerings.  The rest of the companies listed did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n“We are working thoughtfully and diligently to find the best path forward, guided by our desire to support our associates, all of our associates,” Doug McMillon, Walmart chief executive, wrote in a memo to staff Friday.\nAmazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer after Walmart, said it would cover out-of-state abortion travel for its employees, most of whom are hourly workers.  But that perk applies to employees of its healthcare plan, not the contractors who make up a substantial part of its workforce, like its vast network of delivery drivers.\nAs the list of companies covering abortion-related travel grows, some workers wonder why their employers won’t do the same.  Isabela Burrows, 19, who works at a PetSmart in Howell, Michigan, learned that Roe v.  Wade had been knocked down by a client last week and was frustrated that her company had said nothing.  Michigan has an abortion ban that has been blocked in court and which Democratic leaders have said they will not enforce.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — At least three people were killed by an earthquake in southern Iran early Saturday morning, state television reported.\n“Unfortunately, so far we have had three fatalities and eight injuries,” Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, head of emergency management for Hormozgan province on Iran’s Persian Gulf coast, said in the report.\nIranian media said the quake had a magnitude of 6.1, while the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Center put it at 6.0.  The quake struck at a depth of 10 kilometers, or just over six miles, the European monitoring group said.  Tremors were felt in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nMajor geological faults crisscross Iran, which has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years.\n\nSource Link",

At a nighttime happening, young women danced in tunics made of polyurethane birch logs and ponchos studded with foam rocks resembling riverbeds.  Like elves of nature, the dancers frolicked on “nature carpets”, foam carpets made by the Turin artist Piero Gilardi.  Guests sipped their Camparis lying on mock cabbage patches.\nIn the radical sass of a forest glade-like nightclub, Gilardi delivered a serious message, embodying the ecological lesson of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.”” wrote a few years ago: Chemicals were poisoning the earth.  Nature begins at home.  Live with it, respect it, protect it.\n\n\nNow, some 55 years later, in the sh…",

Experts told Insider that the drone wonder weapons are becoming increasingly ineffective because Russia has improved its defense systems and is downing and jamming many of Ukraine's drones.   \nRead more .... \nWNU editor: In the first three months of war there were numerous postings on Ukraine social media of drones being used to knock out Russian armor.
