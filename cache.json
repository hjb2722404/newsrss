I thought, why is this happening in Hong Kong? It is a financial centre, an international city. And yet, many people are living in such poor conditions. I decided to work as a social worker and did so for eight years.”\r \r Embarking on a Journey of Teaching and Research\r \r One could argue that Chan’s academic career started with those…",

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r  \r \r Waves of immigration have been seen again recently from politically and economically less stable and prosperous regions to those so-called Western democratised and industrialised countries. Rapid changes in the geopolitical terrain, along with a drastic transformation in the appeal of the defining elements of democracy and prosperity in the past decade, has made immigration to Western countries less attractive nowadays, but some still hold a perception of Western liberalism as the ultimate goal of immigration.\r \r Regardless of what reasons a person has for deciding to immigrate, some basic challenges presented by the process of immigration and integration into Western host societies include barriers of language, culture, ethnicity, education, recognition of credentials and professional experience, and employment. This does not mean the development and upward mobility of immigrants and their offspring  are hamstrung for good, but empirical research has generally shown that different life trajectories for immigrants and their offspring in Western host societies emerge in the process of assimilation. Some immigrants successfully move to a better-off class—termed the white Protestant middle-class in America by scholars—while many remain in the labouring classes or even urban underclasses, leading a life of poverty and marginalisation.\r \r The picture will be more complicated for the offspring of immigrants. This is because immigrant parents need to overcome the invisible obstacles of intricate educational and social systems to help their children succeed academically and obtain a prestigious college degree as a credential for upward mobility, consonant with what Portes, Fernandez-Kelly, and Haller (2009) mentioned: “(w)ithout the costly and time-consuming achievement of a university degree, such dreams are likely to remain beyond reach” (p. 1081). Specifically, recent research on immigration authored by Dr Jerf YEUNG Wai-keung, Associate Professor of CityU’s Department of Social and…",

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r The past few years have seen huge growth in mobile fitness apps globally. Expecting increased revenue to be generated from this category, app designers strive to add features to enhance the user experience and motivate better performance. \r \r Dr HUANG Guanxiong, Dr Crystal JIANG Li, and doctoral student SUN Mengru from CityU’s Department of Media and Communication surveyed 643 WeRun users to examine the effects of social networking functions of fitness apps on users’ participation in physical activity. WeRun is a fitness plugin embedded in the most widely used mobile social networking app WeChat in China and has accumulated more than 100 million active users. Similar to other fitness apps, WeRun tracks users’ daily step counts and ranks them among WeRun friends. Users can also “like” their friends’ step counts, and the app will notify the users about the “likes” received. \r \r The study focused on the ranking and “liking” functions and linked them to social comparison and social support mechanisms. The survey found that checking WeRun rankings and following more friends on WeRun were positively correlated with participation in physical activity. The social comparison mechanism appeared more dominant than the social support mechanism. Specifically, upward comparison (comparing oneself with those who are more competent in a particular task) was positively associated, and downward comparison (comparing oneself to those who are less competent) was negatively related to physical activity participation. \r \r The more frequently users checked the rankings, the more friends they followed on WeRun and the more upward comparison, leading to more participation in physical activity.  \r \r The study has several implications for motivating physical activity and promoting fitness apps. Fitness app design can benefit from sending more notifications to encourage users to compare their behaviour more often. The design can leverage the positive effects of upward comparison by sending messages like “You are…",

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r Information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as the internet are often thought to have removed the boundaries among countries and brought us to a boundless world. But is that really the case? To investigate this question, research authored by Dr Jun ZHANG, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Asian and International Studies, takes as entry point technological nationalism among middle-class professionals in urban China in the context of the Sino-American trade war of recent years. \r \r Nationalism is a form of identity that is built on—as Benedict Anderson famously argues—an imagined community within a bounded territory. Unlike much existing research, this work does not see ICTs as merely the medium through which nationalism is expressed. Instead, it looks into how ICTs are entangled in people’s everyday lives and how such entanglement shapes “socio-technical imaginaries” of their relationship with their country. Experts may understand ICTs through theories, algorithms and experiments. But when many ordinary people talk about ICTs, they are actually talking about things such as smartphones, and daily practices such as ordering food and hailing a car through online platforms—a way of life that can be called a “platformised lifestyle”.\r \r This research draws on over a decade’s conversations with middle-class professionals and observation of their lifestyles in the urban areas of the Pearl River Delta. It is found that these middle-class professionals are proud of their platformised lifestyle with its unique socio-technological features, high-end smartphones made by Chinese companies, and development in ICTs by tech companies such as Huawei—seemingly advanced enough to alert the American government and thereby leading to Huawei being sanctioned. For many professionals, these achievements suggest that China is moving beyond its sweatshop factory reputation and becoming a rising power in technology. This matters a lot to these professionals. While they have benefited greatly…",

          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r \r In contemporary US politics, the Democratic Party is often regarded as the most welcoming to racial minority groups. Even so, each election cycle sees many members of these groups cast their vote for the Republican Party. In 2016, for example, Chinese Americans from the East Coast to Silicon Valley organised rallies for Republican candidates. Even though former President of the US, Donald Trump consistently used anti-Asian rhetoric throughout the pandemic, he received an even higher share of votes from Asian Americans in 2020 than in 2016. Why do some Asian Americans support a seemingly anti-minority party? \r \r Although existing research underscores the importance of majority-minority relations to voting behaviour, work done by Dr LIU Dongshu, Assistant Professor of CityU’s Department of Public Policy, and other researchers, proposes a new “minority-minority” perspective. He argues that some Asian Americans feel victimised by pro-minority policies promoted by the Democratic Party as they perceive those policies to only help African Americans and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans. This perceived competition results in Asian Americans supporting the Republican Party, whose policies they perceive to, at least, undermine their competitors from other minority groups. In short, we argue that Asian Americans support the seemingly anti-minority Republicans because they feel more threat from other minority groups.\r \r To assess this, the research team relied on two representative surveys of Asian Americans from 2012 and 2016, along with an experiment Liu and his team conducted in 2018. The surveys find that Asian Americans who perceive themselves to have less in common politically with African and Latino Americans are more likely to support the Republican Party. Experimentally, the team uses affirmative action in university admissions, which many Asian Americans believe to disproportionately favour African and Latino Americans at the expense of Asian Americans, to show that Asian…",

Although it has already been 27 years since Chang’s death, her works are still loved by readers of different generations, and provide evergreen inspiration for numerous screen adaptations, such as Ang LEE’s Lust, Caution and Ann HUI’s latest film Love After Love. \r \r To give secondary school students multiple perspectives to understand Chang’s work and her writing style, CityU’s Department of Chinese and History (CAH) organised three events based on her literary works for secondary school students and teachers, to enhance students’ writing skills, and share relevant teaching techniques with other Chinese subject teachers.\r \r Eileen Chang’s Literary Work in Film\r \r Several of Chang’s novels have been made into plays and films in recent decades. The latest adaptation was Love After Love, a movie adapted from Chang’s Agarwood Incense: The First Censer, which was also award-winning director Ann Hui’s third adaptation of Chang’s work. The first event of the series, held on 5 March 2022, originally planned to show Love after Love to students on a large screen in the assembly hall of a secondary school. However, this had to be taken online due to the outbreak of the pandemic’s fifth wave. In spite of that, the event still attracted 256 participants from over 30 secondary schools. Secondary school teacher and juvenile fiction series writer YAN Pui-kei hosted the event and guided students to compare the text with the adaptation. Two teachers from local secondary schools were also invited to discuss Chang’s works in greater depth with students.\r \r \r \r Mastering Techniques of Novel-writing\r \r The characters in Chang’s works have well-defined personalities.

Candidates are challenged about the existence or validity of their university degrees, and controversy is common.\nThis is because, under Kenya’s elections act, contestants for president, senator and, governor seats must show proof of a degree from a university recognised in Kenya. Members of parliament resisted attempts to extend this requirement to them, and the Kenyan High Court ruled in their favour.  \nIt’s not just politicians that are under pressure to produce qualifications. Many public servants have used fake degrees in pursuit of job opportunities or promotions. One case involved a man who posed as a high-ranking police officer for over 10 years.

The government has urged wage restraint to avoid an inflationary spiral.\nUnions formed picket lines around rail stations for the second day this week and warned of more industrial action unless a deal can be reached to improve pay and avoid redundancies.\n\"We'll continue to talk to the companies about everything that's been put on the table and we'll review that and see if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action,\" Mick Lynch, secretary-general of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), told the BBC.\n\"But if we don't get a settlement, it's extremely likely that there will be.\"\nAlthough talks are ongoing, a third day of strikes is planned for Saturday. Other industries are also moving towards industrial action in what unions say could be a \"summer of discontent\".\nThe government has criticized the strikes, calling them counterproductive and most damaging for those on low incomes who depend on public transport and are unable to work from home.\nLater on Thursday, ministers will set out planned changes to a law that would make it easier for businesses to use temporary staff, in a moved designed to minimize the impact of strike action.\n\n\"Once again trade unions are holding the country to ransom by grinding crucial public services and businesses to a halt. The situation we are in is not sustainable,\" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said.\n\"Repealing these 1970s-era restrictions will give businesses freedom to access fully skilled staff at speed, all while allowing people to get on with their lives uninterrupted to help keep the economy ticking.\"\n(REUTERS)",

Pat Fallon of Texas used a hearing about toxic workplace culture to attack football star Tom Brady.\nDuring a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Wednesday, Fallon lashed out at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\"Last week marked the anniversary of the scandal that led to Watergate, which led to felony convictions and the first resignation of a United States president,\" he said. \"And a scant seven and a half years ago, another scandal rocked our nation threatening the very core and foundation of our republic, that being, of course, deflategate.\"\nThe congressman recalled the scandal \"where in an AFC championship game, the NFL footballs, the pigskins, the rock, the pill, the hand egg, the melon and the leather was mysteriously underinflated by two PSI.\"\nFallon noted that the league eventually suspended Brady, referring to him by the nicknames \"the GOAT, the California Cool, Real Slim Brady, the Master of the Tuck, the Lord of the Rings, Tom Terrific.\"\n\"Mr. Commissioner, I'm sure you're aware that many in New England worship Mr. Thomas Patrick Brady as a demigod of sorts,\" he continued. \"My point here, sir, is this country simply can't afford another scandal, particularly a preventable one.\"\nFallon called on Goodell to change the NFL rules to \"guarantee the consistency of the pressure of footballs.\"\nThe rant shocked sports reporter Ari Meirov.\n\"This hearing is off the rails,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nOne video of Fallon had nearly 40,000 views just hours after his remarks.\nWatch the video below.",

As a black woman who rejects the imposition of the “strong black woman” myth in my life, this sentence is one that has always struck me as an unjust demand that we endure serious harm.  Death, in this framework, is indirectly disentangled from the processes of progressive exhaustion of a person.  There’s an immediacy that underlies the cliché saying that if something doesn’t kill you then, then persevering makes you better.  There’s no room for contempt or anger at the thing that didn’t explicitly kill you because you’re now better off for resisting it. \n\nFor my latest book, “America, Damn: Violence, Black Women, and the Struggle for Justice”, I spent years watching what was slowly and dramatically wagi…",

The company dominates the growing electric car market, even as other manufacturers struggle to sell cars due to a shortage of computer chips.\nTesla’s approach, which has been copied by other young electric car makers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, could eventually have major ramifications for the auto industry.  Most automakers and car dealerships are making big profits right now, as the shortage of new cars ha…",

It does this by raising interest rates, which makes mortgages, auto loans, and business loans more expensive.  As silver becomes more expensive, it weighs on spending and hiring, weakening the job market and the economy in general, perhaps in particular.  Slower growth will give supply a chance to catch up with demand.\nThe adjustment process is already unpleasant: Stock prices have fallen, home sales are starts to slow…",

          "description": "A new Granite State poll of likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire signals waning support for former President Donald J. Trump as the party’s 2024 presidential nominee — and growing strength for Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida.\nAmong more than 300 likely Republican primary voters, 37% said they wanted Mr. Trump to be the party’s next presidential nominee, compared with 39% who said they would support Mr. DeSantis, within the margin of error of 5.5% for this question.  Mr. Trump is now “statistically linked” to Mr. DeSantis, according to the poll.\nThat’s a significant change from October, when a Granite State poll showed Mr. Trump had the support of 43% of likely Republican voters;  Mr. DeSantis was at 18%.\n\n\nBut Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted the poll, warned there was still plenty of time before the 2024 presidential cycle: “It’s daylight saving time.  We haven’t even had the midterm elections yet.\n\n\nThe tightening between Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis is “part of a typical pattern,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.  “As the primary draws closer, new candidates are emerging and attracting more media attention, and therefore more voter attention, than the losing candidate from the previous election.”\nThe survey was conducted from June 16 to 20.  It also showed that among more than 840 likely voters in the 2024 general election, Mr. DeSantis was a stronger Republican challenger than Mr. Trump to face President Biden in the next presidential election.\nMr. Biden, who won the state in 2020, would get 50% of the vote if he ran against Mr. Trump, who would get 43%, according to the poll.  But Mr. Biden was only expected to get 46% against Mr. DeSantis, who would get 47%, according to the poll.\nIn a brief interview, Mr. Smith described waning support for Mr. Trump as voters “move away from last year’s model to look at this year’s model”.\n\nSource Link",

Even if Vladimir Putin fails to wrest back Ukraine, his country will remain a haphazard amalgamation of regions and nations with hugely varied histories, cultures, and languages. The Kremlin will continue ruling over colonial holdings in places including Chechnya, Tatarstan, Siberia, and the Arctic. \nRussia’s history is one of almost ceaseless expansion and colonization, and Russia is the last European empire that has resisted even basic decolonization efforts, such as granting subject populations autonomy and a meaningful voice in choosing the country’s leaders.

The grueling conflict has shifted to the eastern provinces, where Russian progress in the Luhansk region has been described as “plodding.” Still, military experts predict that the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk may fall. At the same time, the Ukrainians — increasingly well-equipped, courtesy of the West — talk boldly of reclaiming the southern city of Kherson, which the Russians took early in the conflict. \nAmerican attention has drifted somewhat from the war to domestic concerns, which makes it easy to overlook that what’s unfolding in Ukraine is one of the deadlier conflicts of the past 200 years. That it is a “mere” proxy war, rather than a clash between two great powers, also tends to obscure its scale. But the rate at which soldiers are dying is already significantly higher than in the typical war of the modern era — and both sides are digging in, meaning it will steadily climb the list of conflicts that have caused the most overall fatalities.    \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: A few weeks ago I accepted the depressing fact that this war is going to last a minimum of two years.

Morris believes the leak “must have undoubtedly come from the Biden forces.” \nFurther, Morris says that he’s heard rumors close to the White House that Biden’s dementia is getting worse and has become harder to control and cover up. \n“I believe there may be a move coming to invoke the 25th Amendment against Biden and replace him with Harris,” Morris writes. “Biden’s people are pushing back against it by shooting at Harris and saying that she’s not really ready to be president.”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I must admit that I am surprised that President Biden is still in office.
