          "description": "The summer of 1994 was uncharacteristically warm for Great Britain. Hot, sunny days were followed by close, sticky nights — and by the end of June, pressure had started to build. The last week of the month was an explosive one, meteorologically and culturally. On Friday June 24, an exceptionally severe thunderstorm hit the south east of the UK, diffusing so much grass pollen it triggered a sudden and short-lived asthma epidemic. Two days later, and after years of mounting speculation, the British press broke the news that Prince Charles had accidentally revealed his unfaithfulness to Princess Diana during an ITN documentary. (When asked if he had stayed loyal to his wife, the Prince of Wales nodded. \"Yes absolutely,\" he said before adding of his marriage \"until it became irretrievably broken down.\")",

          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r A compelling tale of palace intrigues and a love triangle, Maria Stuarda is a masterpiece of Italian romanticised poetic vision of the English imperial court in the Tudor era, loosely based on the historical figures Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587) and her cousin Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland (1533-1603).\r \r \r \r Professor Lo Kingman will produce and direct this upcoming production with four live performances. Maestro Wilson Ng will return and join Musica Viva for his second project with the company. The six main roles will be performed by two casts of international and local artists in this operatic gem produced by an all-native creative team, including set designer Isaac Wong, costume designer Andrew Cheung, and lighting designer Zoe Cheung. The opera was last staged in Hong Kong in 1986.\r \r \r \r \r \r As part of his Tudor trilogy, Donizetti wrote Maria Stuarda with the libretto by Giuseppe Bardari (1817-1861), based on Andrea Maffei’s translation of Friedrich Schiller’s 1800 play Maria Stuart. Fascinated by England in the Tudor period (1485-1603), Donizetti wrote three operas around three queens, namely Anna Bolena (1830), Maria Stuarda (1835) and Roberto Devereux (1837).\r \r Donizetti’s Maria Stuarda is a tragedia lirica (tragic opera) with a troubled performance history even before its premiere. It was so fraught with misfortune that diverted audiences’ attention from the opera’s musical richness. Many think Maria Stuarda includes some of the composer’s best works.\r \r Maria Stuarda premiered at La Scala in Milan in 1835 amid a climate of political censorship and suffered neglect shortly after. This operatic gem was revived in Bergamo, Italy in the mid-20th century and many performances were staged around the world subsequently.\r \r In this operatic interpretation of a royal conflict, where 16th-century England meets 19th-century Europe, Donizetti sheathed the themes of honour, virtue, piety, pride and purity in…",

(Taiwan Ministry of National Defense via AP)   \nStraitArrowNews: Taiwan can’t fend off China without US weapons \nSince the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weaponry to the Ukrainians. Things like Javelin anti-tank missiles and HIMARS rockets. Now, as China seems poised to launch an invasion of Taiwan, some are concerned that the U.S. might not have enough weapons to help the self-governing island defend itself. \nDefending Taiwan is a vastly different undertaking from U.S. efforts with Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where Russia could assemble troops along the border before invading, the Chinese would have to cross 100 miles of open ocean to launch an assault. There hasn’t been an amphibious assault on such a scale since the Korean War. \nPreventing the Chinese from establishing a beachhead would be critical to defending the island. If the Chinese succeeded in establishing a footing and is able to transport troops and weapons to the island, the battle is probably over.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Fortunately for Taiwan the Chinese military have a 100 mile ocean that they must cross to launch an assault. But the Chinese will succeed if the firepower is not there to stop them. Bottom line. The Taiwanese need weapons if they have any hope to persevere.\n\nThe same can be said about the Russia - Ukraine war. If Ukraine was not receiving US military aid, the military would have collapsed a long time ago, and the Zelensky government would have been forced to agree to peace terms dictated by Moscow.",
