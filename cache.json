With more research, company executives said, the technology could be used to make many other replacement body parts, including spinal discs, noses, knee menisci, rotator cuffs and joints. reconstructive tissues for lumpectomies.  Later, they said, 3D printing could even produce much more complex vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys and pancreas.\n“It’s so exciting, sometimes I have to calm down a bit,” said Dr. Arturo Bonilla, a pediatric reconstructive ear surgeon in San Antonio who performed the woman’s implant surgery.  The trial was funded by 3DBio Therapeutics, but Dr. Bonilla has no financial stake in the company.  “If all goes as planned, it will revolutionize the way it’s done,” he said.\nJames Iatridis, who directs a spine bioengineering lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said other 3D-printed tissue implants were in the works, but he was unaware of any other product tested in a clinical trial.\n“The 3D ear implant is then a proof-of-concept to assess biocompatibility, shape-matching and shape retention in living people,” said Dr. Iatridis.\nStill, the outer part of the ear is a relatively simple appendage that’s more aesthetic than functional, said Carnegie Mellon’s Dr. Feinberg.  He warned that the road to solid organs – such as livers, kidneys, hearts and lungs – was still a long one.  “Just going from an ear to a spinal disc is a pretty big jump, but it’s more realistic if you have the ear,” he said.\nThe 3D printing manufacturing process creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model.  The technology typically involves a computer-controlled printer laying down material in thin layers to create the precise shape of the object.\n\nSource Link",

Sabrina is brimming with excitement when she shows off her mom’s ballet moves or talks about upcoming vacations, her favorite meals or her day at school.  Or they flip through photo albums, remembering vacations on Assateague Island.\nOne afternoon last year, Sabrina sat at the kitchen counter, drawing an intricate plan of a house where she imagined one of her teachers lived.  When Crystol arrived home, Sabrina ran to greet her.  Then she collapsed on the sofa in anticipation of a massage.  Her mother knelt beside her.  Crystol pretended to make pizza on his daughter’s back – kneading the dough, spreading the sauce and sprinkling the cheese.\nBut within an hour, Sabrina would be overwhelmed with disappointment, frustration, or some emotion she couldn’t name.  She stamped her foot, hard.  And start moaning.\n“Do you need help?”  her father asked, his voice even, his eyes averted.\nBetween moans, Sabrina announced, “I’m crazy.”  But she stopped her parents’ efforts to talk to her.  “I hate you,” she said.  “Leave!”\nAt times like this, her mother encourages her to breathe in and out.  “Smell the roses and blow out the candles,” she says.  And his parents are there, frozen, waiting for the continuation.\nWhen Crystol first saw Sabrina, asleep in a crib in the hospital, she cried with happiness.  It was July 2008. Unable to have a baby on their own, she and Jeremy had become foster parents, planning to adopt.  They brought Sabrina home when she was only a day and a half old.\nThey weren’t intimidated by what the fostering agency told them: Sabrina’s biological mother and father both had developmental disabilities and the father had been arrested for sexual assault.\n\nSource Link",

You’ll be asked to make your choice for Governor (Governor Gavin Newsom is up for re-election), Lieutenant Governor, Treasurer, Attorney General and more.\nYou will be asked to vote for a representative of the House.  And you’ll be asked to vote for the US senator – twice: once to fill out the rest of Vice President Kamala Harris’ term, which ends in January, and once for the full six-year term that begins after that. .\nThen, depending on where you live, you’ll have local elections for your city council, district attorney, mayor, state legislators and more.  (In San Francisco, for example, voters will be asked if they should recall Chesa Boudin, the district attorney.)\nHow does the California primary system work?\nSince 2011, California has had what’s called a first-two primary system, which means the top two candidates will advance in the November general election, regardless of their political party.  The November races could be matchups between two Democrats or two Republicans, rather than between the top Democrat and the top Republican.\nIn almost all statewide elections, there will be a runoff, even if a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.  The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is a notable exception.\nIn local races, a candidate can win with the majority of votes.  The most publicized example is the race for mayor of Los Angeles.  (If a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote this month, they will become mayor without facing a runoff in November.)\nWho should I vote for?\nOf course, we cannot answer that.  But you may want to read your local newspaper’s recommendations, as they will have interviewed candidates.  here are the candidates endorsed by the Los Angeles Times in state and local elections in Southern California.  The Sacramento Bee has compiled its endorsements here.  And here’s the San Francisco Chronicle list of endorsements for national and local elections.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "The Tampa Bay Lightning are talented, tough and playoff tested.  As two-time defending champions, they possess a rare understanding of what it takes to carry the Stanley Cup around the ice – twice in two years.\nBut Rangers striker Barclay Goodrow is also talented, tough and playoff-proven.  And he is also a two-time defending champion.\nGoodrow played for the Lightning in 2020 and 2021 and helped them win those cups.  His experience in that winning venture is part of what prompted Rangers general manager Chris Drury to sign Goodrow as a free agent last summer.  Goodrow received a six-year sentence, $21.8 million contractin part, to add an intangible, but essential, winning ingredient to a team preparing to make a deep playoff.\n“For sure it was a big chunk,” Drury said Tuesday at the Rangers…",

I fought until the last second of the game and I’m proud of it.\nBut the best-of-five-set format remains a different kind of challenge than the best-of-three-set variety played on the regular tour.  For now, Alcaraz’s best results in major tournaments are the quarter-finals at the US Open last year and now in Paris.\n“I didn’t start well, and at this level, quarter-final of a Grand Slam, you are playing against the best players in the world, so you have to start the game better than I did today” , said Alcaraz.  “I have to follow the lesson.  I mean, I have to improve for the next Grand Slam or the next games.  But I would say that I am not far from reaching a semi-final or winning a Grand Slam.\nZverev, a semi-finalist at Roland Garros last year, clearly felt the odds were stacked against him on Tuesday in light of recent results at Alcaraz.  Alcaraz had won the Barcelona and Madrid titles back-to-back on red clay and were on their way back to Roland Garros after saving a match point against fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos-Viñolas in the second round.\n“I knew I had to play my best tennis today from the start, and I’m glad I did,” Zverev said.  “Obviously he kept coming back. He’s an amazing player. I told him at the net, he’s going to win this tournament many times, not just once, and I just hope I can win it before it starts. fight all of us, and we won’t stand a chance.\nZverev, despite his strong performance (and obvious relief) on Tuesday, is still a long way from winning his first Grand Slam singles title.  In the semi-finals he will face the winner of Tuesday’s second match: a night session between Djokovic and fifth seed Rafael Nadal, who has won the French Open a record 13 times.\n“It’s not really easier from here,” said Zverev, still elated.  “But I’ve often said, I’m no longer 20 or 21;  I am 25.  I’m at the stage where I want to win, I’m also at the stage where I’m supposed to win.\n\nSource Link",

After Donbas Russian forces will be focused on the city of Zaporizhhia (see the above map),  and after that the city of Dnipro. \nThis is open country, and ideal terrain for Russian forces to do what they have always been trained to do. Conduct operations that isolate enemy units, and then destroy them with artillery. \nOn another sad note. This region and the Donbas has always been the industrial heartland of Ukraine. Its loss will be incalculable for Ukraine, and the Kremlin knows it.",
