The Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority, including three justices nominated by Trump, will expedite consideration of the request. Trump's trial is set to begin on March 4, 2024.",

The miners failed to emerge at the end of their Thursday night shift at Springs, east of Johannesburg, in a near repeat of a three-day protest in October, the Gold One company said. The miners all came out on Monday. Twelve were injured and were taken to hospital with injuries including fractures and cuts, said Ziyaad Hassam, head of legal affairs at the Gold One mine in Gauteng province.",

          "description": "The Hollywood sign, a landmark symbol of the film industry, celebrated its 100th birthday by being illuminated for the first time in decades. The sign was originally constructed in 1923 as an advertisement for an upscale real estate development and initially read \"HOLLYWOODLAND.\" It has since been featured in numerous films and has seen real-life tragedy, such as the suicide of actress Peg Entwistle. Over the years, the sign has undergone restoration and currently reads \"HOLLYWOOD.\" The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce played a key role in preserving the sign and turning it into a trademark for the town.",

The court froze the lower court's ruling that would have allowed Kate Cox to obtain the procedure. Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, sought an emergency hearing after learning her unborn baby had trisomy 18. The court's decision has sparked debate over the state's medical exception to its strict abortion ban after six weeks.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

The bill must pass the Senate and be signed by President Joe Biden before becoming law. It is uncertain whether there will be enough time in the Senate schedule for it to be voted on this year.

          "description": "French lawmakers sent the government’s immigration bill back to the drawing board on Monday, in a surprise move that cut short debates at the lower house and dealt a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to pass laws without a majority.\nLawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far right party as well as many conservatives joined forces to reject the bill on its first day in the National Assembly, adopting a motion proposed by the Greens, which passed by just two votes.\nThe rejection does not mean the government needs to resign and does not signal the end of the immigration bill.\nThe government can now decide to send it back to the upper house, send it to a joint committee of senators and deputies to find a compromise, or pull it, which is unlikely.\nIt can also use special executive powers to force its adoption without a vote.\nThe immigration bill has been a key plank of Macron’s attempts to show he can be tougher on law and order issues while keeping France’s doors open to foreign workers who can help the French economy.\nBut short of a majority in parliament, he has struggled to pass a bill that has strict provisions disliked by left-wing lawmakers and more liberal aspects criticised by some conservatives and the far right.\nThe government has presented the bill as essential to expel foreign criminals more easily. One provision removes a ban on expelling those migrants who arrived in France before the age of 13, as was the case for the alleged Russian-born Islamist militant who killed a French teacher in October.\nOther provisions that have been hotly debated are whether non-EU migrants should continue to get access to free medical coverage in France, as well as the government’s aim to facilitate the legalisation of workers in industries suffering from labour shortages such as cafes and restaurants.\n(Reuters)",

          "description": "A fresh indictment against Hunter Biden will have broken the “spirit” of US President Joe Biden, says Curtin University's Dean of Global Futures Professor Joe Siracusa. \n\nThe President’s son is facing a total of nine criminal charges, which accuse him of failing to pay his taxes when spending big on his luxurious lifestyle. \n\nHunter has evaded more than $1.4 million in taxes while funding his extravagant lifestyle, which includes drugs, escorts, cars and luxury hotels. \n\n“This, I think, finishes off the Biden administration – Biden is weary,” Professor Siracusa told Sky News Australia. \n\n“There’s going to be a hell of a race to replace him in the Democratic Party.”",
