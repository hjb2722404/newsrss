At first, around the shores, the continental shelf is little more than an extension of the adjoining landmass. But then one reaches the edge of the abyss and, with the sudden drop that follows, everything changes. Remarkably, in view of what is known about the rest of the planet, and even outer space, most of the ocean floor remains largely a mystery. The scientific consensus is that only 5% of the deep sea has been explored in any detail. When a passenger jet was lost somewhere in the Indian Ocean in 2014, rescuers floundered without definitive maps of the maritime space and its currents at different depths that might have helped in their search.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2024/03/07/36184\">Read the full story, ‚ÄúInto the Abyss: The Scramble for the Ocean Floor‚Äù, on globalissues.org</a> ‚Üí</p>",

          "description": "Argentine President Javier Milei and former U.S. president Donald Trump made calls to \"make Argentina great again\", as the right-wing firebrands met at a conservative conference on Saturday.\nKnown for their distinctive hair, spicy oratory and rejection of traditional political norms, the two men met behind the scenes at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, which they addressed separately.\nAnd both were keen to repurpose Trump's electoral sales pitch -- \"Make America great again\" -- for the South American country.\n\"Make Argentina great again,\" Trump said as they posed for photos backstage, while Milei rasped his famous Spanish-language slogan: \"Long live freedom, damn it!\"\nDespite myriad legal woes, Trump is gearing up for a probable rematch with President Joe Biden in November's elections, having lost to the Democrat in 2020.\nAnd he was very much on home turf at CPAC, where he is wildly popular.\nDuring his speech, Trump said Milei \"has achieved a lot, he is a great gentleman, he is MAGA,\" noting that the acronym for his famous tagline works with either country's name.\nElected last year on a wave of anger over decades of economic crisis, right-winger Milei has embarked on massive economic deregulation by presidential decree.\nHe also has devalued the peso and cut state subsidies.\nMilei too invoked \"MAGA\" in a speech.\n\"We are not going to give up on making Argentina great again,\" he said, during an address in which he warned that the world \"is in danger\" due to socialism.\nHe ended with a plea: \"Do not give up your freedom, fight for your freedom because if you do not fight for freedom it will lead you to misery.\"\n¬© Agence France-Presse",

And here's the thing. There's a lot to dislike, sort of every link of the chain here. First of all, the FBI writes down lots of things that human informants and confidential informants say. That doesn't mean it is necessarily true. Yes, they record it in a form, 1023, but they write it down. It doesn't mean it's verified, it doesn't mean it's accurate, it doesn't mean it's reliable. Once they receive it, they have to go about the hard work of corroborating it, or debunking it. And it sounds like the FBI never corroborated, and indeed, ultimately debunked this disinformation.\"\nHe continued:\n\"So why this debunked Russian disinformation would then be handed off to Republican members of Congress to be used as the basis to impeach an American president is mystifying, Ayman. And look, let's use Jim Jordan as an example. You played a clip of him appearing to double down, even though he now knows it's Russian disinformation, and Smirnov has been indicted for lying to the FBI about the Bidens. Jim Jordan is a serial abuser of his position and his authority. This is the guy who refused to comply with a lawfully issued congressional subpoena because had he complied and testified he might have incriminated Donald Trump.\"\nWatch the video below or click the link.",
