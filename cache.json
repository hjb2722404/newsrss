          "description": "From Bollywood-style dance to henna tattoo workshops, celebrations for Queen Elizabeth’s record-breaking 70-year reign in the northwestern English city of Preston had a multicultural flavour on Saturday. With a population of 140,000 and close to Manchester, Preston is home to a large community with South Asian ancestry, and this year combined its annual festival of subcontinental arts, culture, tradition and heritage with celebrations for the queen’s Platinum Jubilee. To mark the royal landmark, the Preston City Mela, a showcase for all things South Asian since 1997, broadened its scope to include culture from the 54 Commonwealth countries.  “Of course we live in this country and we do love our queen, but it’s nice to have our culture in the spotlight for a change, and all the Commonwealth cultures as well,” Hanifa, a Preston resident of Indonesian origin, told Agence France-Presse. “The atmosphere is so nice and to have all those influences, all these cultures, makes it even nicer,” said the 60-year-old, who was enjoying the day with friends. She said she watched on television as the royal celebrations got under way in central London on Thursday with the Trooping of the Colour military parade, and found it “moving” to see the queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family. Gulab Singh, organiser of the Preston mela, said this year’s curators had tried to align with the jubilee “as much as we can”. “With the Mela, it’s always South Asian art, but we’ve broadened it up to reflect the Commonwealth perspective,” he explained. “This year, we have a cake-cutting ceremony … Cake cutting is sooo British,” added fellow organiser Shreya Ghodke. The Commonwealth is a grouping of mainly former British colonies headed by the queen, who is also head of state in 14 of these countries or realms in addition to the UK. Australia, New Zealand hail Queen Elizabeth as republic question returns Sitting in the sun, 58-year-old Amit Chauhan was getting into the festive mood, eating vegetable samosas and nodding to the music…",

Their number, 450 to 500, is smaller than the last deployment. \nThe decision to redeploy in Somalia might appear to be surprising, for two important reasons. First, US president Joe Biden promised during his campaign to avoid the “forever wars” against terror lasting since 2002. None of these wars were ever fully won and remain unpopular with the US electorate. It is also surprising in the light of moves to restructure the US military to meet a threat from China. \nWhat better …",

Putin has warned that if Kiev receives long-range missiles, Russia will move and strike sites that have been off-target so far. -/Kremlin/dpa\nSupplying long-range missiles of Western manufacture to Ukraine will result in a strong response from Russian forces, President Vladimir Putin told state broadcaster Rossija 1.\n“If they supply, then we will draw the corresponding conclusions from this and deploy our means of destruction, of which we have enough, to deliver blows to those objects that we are not yet attacking,” he said. The West’s aim in supplying arms to Ukraine was to draw out the conflict, Putin said.\nThe Russian leader appeared relaxed about the delivery of modern HIMARS multiple rocket launchers announced by the United States, saying it would not change the balance of forces fundamentally. “There’s nothing new here,” he said, noting that the Ukrainian army already had similar, Russian-made systems and that US deliveries would just replace systems that had been destroyed.\nPrecisely which missiles were deployed would be decisive, Putin said. According to his information, missiles with ranges of between 45 and 70 kilometres would be supplied, similar to Russia’s Uragan, Smerch and Grad systems. Ukraine had 515 such systems when the \"operation\" began and is still thought to have 360, he said.",

My condition was the worst,\" he blogged in April.\n\"But this time it's different, I was sent off by many people and have their support through tracking systems and wireless radio. I couldn't be more grateful.\"\nAside from his 1962 Pacific crossing, Horie is known for sailing around the world solo in 1974 and his longitudinal voyage around the world between 1978 and 1982.\nThe latest expedition was the first he had undertaken since 2008, when he sailed from Honolulu to the Kii Strait on a wave-powered 31-foot boat.\n© 2022 AFP",

And the next day I lost all my sponsors,\" she told French television this week.\n\"I want to thank you for everything you've done for women's tennis and for women,\" Martina Navratilova said in the French Open video.\n\"What a beautiful tribute. Thank you,\" King responded in a tweet.\n© 2022 AFP",

He believes Russia is keeping them there to make it more difficult for Ukraine to mount a counter-offensive.\n\"They are being held there by Russian troops and practically used as human shields,\" he said in Kiev.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kiev is waiting for further weapons to be delivered from the West before trying to liberate more territory.\nBoichenko also said that more than 20,000 people had been killed in the fighting around the largely destroyed city of Mariupol.\n\"This is twice as many as in World War II under German occupation. It is the biggest bloodshed in the history of Mariupol,\" he said. The figures could not be independently verified. He added that the risk of infection from only partially buried corpses is high.\nMariupol city head Vadym Boichenko updates the press on the operational humanitarian and social situation in Mariupol during a briefing at the Ukraine-Ukrinform Media Center. -/Ukrinform/dpa",

The exploration and rites of passage it took to find these places, their secrecy or their access maintained through generations of internet users in some cases, can vanish with an over-eager Instagram post.  And one geotagged Instagram post begets another and another.\n“There are people who feel like they’ve tended a garden for years, and then you come in with a dirt bike and donuts and peel it, kicking the dirt in their face,” said Devon Howard, the former editor.  of Longboard magazine and a leading figure in surfing.\nDropbox, a fun and once-quiet spot near Mulcoy’s Tofino home, is now so crowded he doesn’t bother surfing there anymore.  If someone shares a photo of the wave pulling one day, the break is filled with new surfers the next, he said.\nSome photographers have redirected their careers to respect local breaks. Chris Burcard, an outdoor photographer with 3.8 million Instagram followers, has become known for his photographs of extremely remote locations.  It wasn’t his original plan: the central coast of California, where he’s from, is full of big waves – but ill will towards anyone photographing them.\n“One of the reasons I was drawn to remote, wild places was because I was so tired of taking care of things at home,” Burkard said, using a swear word, citing having his car vandalized and receiving death threats.\nHe and other photographers see no reason to name a place, even if it is photographed.\n“For me, the mystery and anonymity of the surfing experience is key,” Burkard continued.  “When I grew up seeing these secluded beaches on the cover of Surfer, and all you got was the name of a country, it was so cool. Which made me want to make it a career is literally this lack of information.\n\n\nSource Link",

It’s not a ban, but it does mean the number of handguns legally owned by Canadians outside of the military and police won’t increase from the roughly 900,000 currently held.\nThe other thing that caught the eye was the government’s decision to follow through on its earlier ban on military-style assault rifles with a mandatory buyback program.\nThe bill, however, goes beyond freezing and banning.

This year, its data shows that more than 11,600 parties are planned in Scottsdale, compared to 30,000 in Nashville.  If that rate of growth continues in Scottsdale, Mr. Petrakis said, it has the potential to overtake Nashville in terms of bookings.  And on a recent weekend in May, more than one bachelor party attendee said Scottsdale was “the new Nashville.”\nRobert Mayer, 35, owner of Arizona Party Bike, said his Scottsdale location began booking a record number of bachelorette parties in the summer of 2020. Brides were looking for a place to celebrate without restrictions pandemics, he added.  Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, never enacted a statewide mask mandate and reopened restaurants for indoor dining in May 2020. In Maricopa County , which includes Scottsdale, about 1,200 new Covid cases are currently reported per day.\nMr. Mayer’s company, which features on Bach, runs tours of the Old Town on cart-sized cranksets, charging up to $499 (plus the cost of alcohol) for two-hour private tours for up to 15 people.  His clientele is currently 75% female, with a median age of 28, he said.  Local outfitters of hot air balloons and desert jeep tours are also teeming with groups of women in their twenties singing Katy Perry songs and only occasionally throwing up.\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that the influx has already caused unrest.  One Saturday in May at the Arizona Party Bike depot in Old Town, Lacy Gray, 27, a company guide, had to explain the rules of the road to a South Dakota bachelor party after her members, sporting candy-colored wigs, took their seats at a neon-pink pedal bar.\nAn instruction?  No playback requests “‘WAP’, specifically,” Ms. Gray said.  (The song was proactively banned, Mr. Mayer added, after attracting stares from “disgruntled” pedestrians.)\n\nSource Link",

Barber rushed for 1,196 yards and 1,269 yards in 2003 and 2004.\nThe Cowboys selected him in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft.\nFootball was a family affair for barbers.  In addition to his father, Barber’s brothers, Thomas and Dominique, also played for the University of Minnesota Gophers.  Dominique was a defensive back with the Houston Texans of the NFL.\nIn a statement Thursday, PJ Fleck, head coach of the Gophers, said, “Marion was one of the best to ever play in Minnesota, and he’s a big reason a lot of people are Gopher fans today.”\n\n\nSource Link",

Gauff, the prodigy from Delray Beach, Florida, is a particularly thoughtful and committed finalist, ready to use her athletic success to speak out on social issues, like gun violence in the United States, which she did after her semi-final victory over Martina Trevisan on Thursday.\nJust four years ago, they both competed in the French Open women’s tournament, with Gauff winning the title and Swiatek losing in the semi-finals.

          "description": "In 1980, Fred Wilpon would buy the team, adding another layer of connective tissue: Wilpon attended Lafayette High School in Brooklyn with Dodgers Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax and was a rabid Brooklyn Dodgers fan.  It was under his leadership that Citi Field opened in 2009 with so many Dodgers-related touches — including the enormous Jackie Robinson Rotunda — that some Mets fans complained there were no more winks. in Brooklyn than at the Mets.\nThe connections would only continue, with Mike Piazza’s Hall of Fame career spanning the franchises and Justin Turner, a crucial member of the current Dodgers squad, having started his career in orange and blue.\nNow Steven A. Cohen, who tried to buy the Dodgers in 2012, is calling the Mets shots.  In his first public remarks after buying the Mets, he cited the Dodgers as a model of what he hoped the Mets would become.  He backed that up by pushing the Mets payroll near the top of the sport.\n“They’re going to separate themselves from the pack,” said Valentine, who, in keeping with the connective tissue theme, was once married to a daughter of Ralph Branca, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  “Kind of like the Dodgers tried to do when they left town, and the Yankees always have.”\nTwo of Hodges’ adult children — Gil Jr., 72, and Irene, 71 — plan to be at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, along with two of Irene’s granddaughters and a cousin.  And as the videos roll and the lights flash, the iron steel cable that spans decades and miles will remain as strong as ever.\n“Without a doubt, the 1969 World Series was amazing,” says Irene Hodges of her favorite memory.  “Everyone was just thrilled.  All of Brooklyn was crazy.  It was a wonderful moment.  My dad, I think, was a little scared to manage in New York.  He knew how good the fans were here, how much they loved him, and he just wanted to do the right thing for them.  He wanted to have a successful team.  And he did.”\n\nSource Link",

She took command early on Saturday to win her 35th straight game and sixth straight tournament.\n“Two years ago to win this title was something incredible,” Swiatek said.  “Honestly, I couldn’t expect better, but this time I feel like I worked hard and did everything to get here even though it wa…",

Mere days before, two assassins on motorbikes shot dead an Iranian military colonel in the heart of Tehran. In February, several drones hit an Iranian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base in the west of the country at Kermanshah. Although never officially taking responsibility, various unsubtle hints by Israeli officials and media reports have left little doubt as to the provenance of these attacks.   \nRead more .... \nUpdate: Senior Iranian Officer Dies, Leaving Questions About His Death((New York times)    \n WNU Editor: Israel would not do this alone.
