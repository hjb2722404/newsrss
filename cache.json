It led foreign policy experts to fear that the invasion was part of a larger war of genocide.\nBy the end of May, Russian state TV was threatening to invade Poland. Now that the war has been going on for 131 days, a Daily Beast report cited Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko hinted that the next war will be against Europe as a whole. \n“The time has come for the forgetful Europe to give itself a moral cleansing,” Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state television's BelTA.\nLukashenko talked about fighting Nazis in World War II, known to Russians as the “Great Patriotic War,” and said that their efforts aren't over.\n IN OTHER NEWS…",

          "description": "While the United States Catholic bishops continue a debate over whether politicians should get communion, another group of bishops is working on making desperate deals with drug traffickers, Vice News said citing Mexican newspaper Milenio. \n“There is a need for a social pact,” said Bishop Sigifredo Noriega. “A pact where even the bad guys could have a say.”\nThe \"bad guys\" he's talking about are organized crime groups that have been increasing decades-long violence in Mexico. The Catholic church is estimated to have multiple billions of dollars but they're not about to use it for a holy war against the drug cartels in Central America. \nTwo priests were killed last month in church and they are searching for solutions. The assumption seems to be that giving them \"a say\" might persuade the narcos to work cooperatively within the community to traffick their drugs without so many murders. \nIN OTHER NEWS: Family says road rage shooting that was captured on video was racially motivated\n\"The bishop of Zacatecas suggested 'directly speaking' with members of organized crime,\" said the report. It explained, \"Zacatecas is one of Mexico’s states most affected by violence related to drug trafficking, and is leading in the ranking on murders this year.\"\n\nFather Javier Campos was 79 years old when he was murdered and Father Joaquín Mora was 80. Their deaths are said to be a result of drug boss José Noriel Portillo “El Chueco” (of the Sinaloa Cartel) chased a tourist guide into the church. The priests tried to protect the man but they were all three killed, said Chihuahua state authorities. They were then dumped two days later about 125 miles from the church. \n\"The murder of the Jesuit priests reinforces the call to examine the security strategy in Mexico, as we are experiencing a wave of historical violence: the number of murders so far this six-year term exceeds 122,000 people,\" the Archdiocese of Mexico said in an editorial.\nRead the full report at Vice News.",

          "description": "Britain's finance and health ministers resigned on Tuesday, in what looked to be the final blow for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's premiership after he had tried to apologize for the latest scandal to dog his administration.\nBoth finance minister Rishi Sunak and health minister Sajid Javid resigned in what appeared to be a choreographed release of letters to the prime minister, in which both took aim at his ability to run an administration that adhered to standards.\nThe resignations came as Johnson was apologising for what he said was a mistake for not realizing that a former minister in charge of pastoral care was unsuitable for a job in government after complaints of sexual misconduct were made against him.\nBoth had formerly publicly supported Johnson during months of scandal over his administration's conduct and a damning report into parties at his Downing Street office and residence that broke strict COVID-19 lockdown rules.\nSunak, who had reportedly clashed with the prime minister in private about spending, said: \"For me to step down as Chancellor while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other serious challenges is a decision that I have not taken lightly.\"\n\"However, the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously. I recognize this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning.\"\nJavid said many lawmakers and the public had lost confidence in Johnson's ability to govern in the national interest.\n\"I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership - and you have therefore lost my confidence too,\" Javid said in a letter to Johnson.\n(REUTERS)",

It also partially destroyed the interiors of the shops including a hairdressers and a travel agent.\nYusuf Karacelik, parliamentary group leader of the party in Oberhausen, said in a written statement on Tuesday that he assumed it was a \"targeted attack from the right.\"\nSpeaking to dpa, Karacelik called it a \"right-wing terrorist attack.\"\nNational party leader Janine Wissler also said she believed there could be a right-wing political motive behind the blast.\nThere are currently no indications of who carried out the suspected bombing. A police spokesperson said that they were investigating all possible leads and that a political motivation could not be ruled out.\nGlass lie on the ground after an explosion at The Left Party (Die Linke) office.

I appealed to the Prime Minister to work with the Moscow administration to resolve the problem and I want to strengthen the Jewish community in Russia, which must be worried at this time about the consequences of the decision.

Morgan, who scored twice on Monday, and Megan Rapinoe both received their first call-ups to the squad since October for the Concacaf event.  But Morgan, 33, is already defending his position against rising stars like Catarino Macario, who is currently out with a knee injury.  And young forwards like Mallory Pugh, Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman all play in the same position as Rapinoe, who turned 37 on Tuesday.\n“It’s not easy being a striker in the United States right now,” Andonovski said when he announced his Concacaf Championship roster.  “Obviously it’s great, but it’s not easy because the competition is getting bigger and bigger.\nSimilar battles are playing out on the pitch at every position, in every roster decision, as the United States go from a roster that has taken them to two consecutive World Cup titles to one that could take it to one. third against regional rivals like Canada, the reigning Olympic gold medalistand European contenders like Sweden, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and England – among others – who contest the European championship this month.\nThe Americans’ remaining group stage schedule includes matches against Jamaica (Thursday) and Mexico (Monday).  Canada leads Group B, which includes Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Panama.  The final will take place on July 18.\nTo achieve this, Andonovski will rely on a mix of experience, talent and generations at his disposal: of the 23 players in the American squad, seven are in their thirties but eight are 25 or younger.  And so far, he hasn’t made any promises to anyone.\n“It doesn’t mean that all these players who have done well in the past are just going to come back here at the next camp because they did well a year or two years ago,” Andonovski said in February, when a the previous list also omitted several accomplished veterans.\n\nSource Link",

In Florida, case and death data are released only once every two weeks.  As recently as last week, many other public testing sites shut down Alaska, Colorado and Rhode Island;  Iowa is closing many sites by the end of next week.\nRecent virus numbers have wobbled during holidays like Memorial Day and Juneteenth, during which many states often pause reporting and then restart tracking afterwards, a trend that is sure to continue this week. after the 4th of July holiday weekend.\n“Tracking the daily test tally is less informative than it used to be,” Dr Adalja said, citing the strong link between cases and hospitalizations in the past.  Today’s numbers shouldn’t be treated like checking a sports team’s daily standings or scores, he added.\n“I think testing plays a different role,” he said.  “Even when testing was at a different stage, it was always an underestimate.”\nTo get localized insight into the evolution of the virus, Dr Adjala said he had come to rely on hospitalizations as a percentage of his capacity.  It also checks the CDC community level monitoring, which includes new hospital admissions and the number of beds used.  He urges focusing on serious illnesses, rather than following “booms and busts of cases”.\nHospitalizations increased slightly throughout June, although they remain low.

Castro-Huerta, in which the State of Oklahoma asserted that it had jurisdiction to prosecute certain crimes committed against Indian citizens on Indian reservations.  This claim was unsupported by law or history, violating legal precedents, established practices in other states, and the clear intent and authority of Congress.\n\nThis week, Gorsuch got his answer: Yes, the court would wither and side with an aggressively political media campaign against the rule of law.

Less than 12 hours earlier, five people were injured in a shooting in Chicago’s South End.\nThe Highland Park shooting was notable for its scale (at least three dozen injured), its fatality (at least six killed) and its location, an affluent suburb that doesn’t often see such violence.  But it was part of a pattern: the brutal pervasiveness of gun violence in a nation with more guns than people.\n\n\nBy early Monday morning, at least 57 people had been shot in Chicago over the July 4 weekend, nine of them fatally, according to NBC Chicago.

Wade, a question lurks between court opinions and news reports: why are pregnancy risks so rarely discussed anywhere, even though this information is relevant not only to individual decisions, but also to policies regarding abortion, pregnancy and health care for women?\nWith the wave of abortion bans unfolding across US states, these risks are going to come into greater focus – figuring both in women’s decisions to risk getting pregnant if they live in a state that has banned abortions, and arguments that will occur in state legislative chambers about the degree of threat to a mother’s health that must be present to permit an abortion under untested and rapidly changing state laws.\n…",
