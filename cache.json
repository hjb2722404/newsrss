A truck arrives from the Bucha town morgue — inside, the remains of 20 unidentified bodies. It's the third such burial at the town cemetery in the last week. Father Andriy stands alone among the dead — there are no relatives here to mourn their passing. As they are lowered into the ground, he is here to ensure they will not be forgotten.\n\"It is very important for us to bury them with dignity, not just to bury them as bodies, but to bury them as people with the hope of resurrection from the dead,\" says the Orthodox priest. \nSix months after the massacre in Bucha, the scene at the cemetery is the beginning of a process of closure.

          "description": "Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin on Thursday said she was upset that videos of her dancing at private parties were published online as they were meant to be seen only by friends.\nMarin, 36, spoke after a two-minute video of her singing and dancing with well-known local influencers and artists spread on social media and in Finnish media on Wednesday.\nThe clips were originally posted to a private Instagram account. Marin, who became the world's youngest serving government leader in December 2019, said she knew she was being filmed but never thought the videos would become publicly available.\n\"These videos are private and filmed in a private space. I resent that these became known to the public,\" Marin told reporters. She said she did not know who leaked them.\nMany Finns have voiced support for the young leader for combining a private life with her high-profile career. But newspaper Helsingin Sanomat said the episode raised questions about her judgement.\n\"Marin may have acted in good faith, but this gullible she should not be,\" the paper wrote in an editorial.\n\"The prime minister can, in a sensitive situation, put the weapons of information warfare in the hands of those who would like to hurt Finland,\" the newspaper said.\nMarin said the video was a compilation of clips from two separate occasions a few weeks ago. She said people at the events consumed alcohol but no one took drugs to her knowledge.\n\"We just partied, also in a boisterous way. I danced and sang,\" Marin said, denying a claim that the videos had been a publicity stunt less than a year until the next general election.\nMarin in January told Reuters she and her fellow young female ministers have been targeted with extensive hate speech for their gender and appearance while in office. \n(REUTERS)",

Aaron Chown/PA Wire/dpa\nResearchers say that the lava flow at a volcano in Iceland that started erupting earlier this month has slowed down in the past few days.\nAccording to measurements by researchers at the University of Reykjavik, the lava flow was only moving at two metres per second on Tuesday. This number is subject to change, however.\nThe researchers said it is not possible to say whether the slowing lava flow is that the eruption is coming to an end or whether it is just a temporary slowdown.\nThe eruption started in a valley near Fagradalsfjall mountain on the Reykjanes peninsula south-west of Reykjavik, on August 3.\nThousands of tourists have visited the site of the eruption, a chasm which is hundreds of metres long.\nTo the annoyance of the Icelandic authorities, onlookers have repeatedly strayed into the lava field.\nThe path to the eruption site is to remain closed on Wednesday due to a storm warning.\nMagma flows from a heart shaped crater at the volcano in Fagradalsfjall, following an eruption from a new fissure on the Reykjanes Peninsula, around 35 miles (56 km) from the capital city of Reykjavic, the eruption has been ongoing since the 3rd August 2022.

In April this year at a briefing, he questioned whether \"black and white lives\" in emergencies worldwide are given equal attention.\nWHO emergencies director Mike Ryan also hit out at an apparent shortage of concern about the drought and famine unfolding in the Horn of Africa, and the ensuing health crisis.\n\"No one seems to give a damn about what's happening in the Horn of Africa,\" said Ryan, speaking at a virtual media briefing on Wednesday.\nThe WHO called for $123.7 million to tackle the health problems resulting from growing malnutrition in the region, where around 200 million people live and millions are going hungry.\n(Reporting by Jennifer Rigby; Editing by Hugh Lawson)",

Yet too many institutions continue to discriminate in the name of redressing discrimination.  The latest example is that of the public schools in Minneapolis.\nThe new Minneapolis teachers’ collective agreement requires layoffs to be based on seniority — also known as “last in, first out” — if positions need to be cut for financial reasons.  But minority teachers tend to be younger and less experienced than white teachers.  Thus, the contract exempts members of an “underrepresented group” from the seniority layoff rule.\n\nSchool districts should hire and fire based on job qualifications and performa…",

There are some stark facts that must be acknowledged: \n1) Ukraine’s air force is inactive. Whatever still exists is not providing close air support to besieged Ukrainian troops or carrying out aerial attacks against Russian positions. \n2) Ukraine’s rotary wing aircraft–i.e., helicopters–also is inactive.

They might not know much else about Ukraine, but they know it’s the kind of place where just being the son of the vice president of the United States can get you an $83,000 monthly paycheck for sitting on the board of an energy company. \nNo one knows this better than Ukrainians themselves, who have to put up with a level of official corruption on par with countries like Mexico and Gabon. Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Ukraine 122 out of 180 countries worldwide, and the second most corrupt country in Europe — right after Russia.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Being someone whose nationality is partly Ukrainian and who has many family members and friends who are still in Ukraine, I know too well that the culture of corruption is unfortunately endemic in Ukrainian society.

He warned that Russia has a preference for using certain special dates for so-called “congratulations.” \nThere are concerns that Russia might use Belarus as a launchpad for attacks given a flurry of movements observed there in recent days, according to Ihnat. \n“We constantly observe the movement of [Russian] troops in the territory of Belarus, as well as the transportation of ammunition, Iskander and other types of missiles. This happens all the time. If an Il-76 flies from the Russian Federation to the territory of Belarus, then it is clear that it delivers weapons,” Ihnat said.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I have been reading a lot of unverified news reports from Russia in the past few weeks that it is preparing a major offensive on the Ukraine front in the coming weeks.

According to an expert, this Chinese-made MLRS could be a ‘game changer’ in a potential conflict with Taiwan. \nThe pictures were posted on Twitter by Lyle Goldstein, the Director of Asia Engagement at the Defense Priorities think tank. \nAccording to Goldstein, the images, sourced from the Chinese television channel CCTV-7, showed the MLRS firing rockets into the Taiwan Strait on August 4, as part of the Chinese military drills in waters surrounding Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s arrival on the island by aircraft on August 2, despite several warnings from China.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Here is a summary on how China's missile systems compare to the US HIMAR ....
