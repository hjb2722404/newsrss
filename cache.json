          "description": "BREAKING NEWS - Check back for updates\nBrazil’s presidential race will need to go to an October 30th second round after former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fell short of the 50%+1 he needed to avoid a run-off with extremist incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.\nBrazilians voted Sunday in a historic presidential election, with leftist front-runner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who led in the pre-election polls, winning but still short of the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff election.\n\nThere are fears the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro will not accept a defeat after he warned that he will only leave office if he's \"killed, jailed, or victorious\" and has called on his base to \"go to war\" if the vote is \"stolen.\"\nBolsonaro took an early lead as results started coming in but in 2014, when Lula's leftist party last won a presidential election, it only took the lead after two hours of vote counting. Results from Brazil’s poorer northeast, Lula's stronghold, take longer to be counted.\nLula eventually took the lead when 70.00% of the vote was counted.\n\nWith 98.04% of the vote counted at 8:45pm EDT:\n\nWith 70.00% of the vote counted at 7:02pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 63.45% of the vote counted at 6:54pm EDT:\n\nEARLIER: With 46.46% of the vote counted at 6:35pm EDT:\n\n\nLula went into Sunday ahead of Bolsonaro in pre-election polls with 50 percent to 36 percent, according to the final poll from the Datafolha institute.\nTo win outright and avoid a runoff on October 30th: 50% + 1 votes are needed.\nPolls closed at 5:00pm local time (20.00 GMT) or 4:00pm EST.\nOfficial results can be found here: latest Brazil Election Results",

          "description": "There is a growth gap between the incomes of black women and white men. \n\nThis year’s Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, the date that symbolizes how far black women must work in the current year to match what white men did the year before, was September 21 ― more than a month later than last year.  The most recent analysis revealed that Black women only earn 58 cents for every dollar paid to white men.  This is five cents less than the previous year’s data.\n\nBut even more worrying than growing pay disparities is that the stress of discrimination in the workplace makes many black women physically ill.  It’s time for corporate America to address the inequalities in the workplace that particularly harm the well-being of black women. \n\nDiscrimination in the workplace impacts all aspects of black wo…",

Ahead of the midterm elections, GOP candidates are running campaign ads with the claim and pledging to stop the IRS once Republicans control Congress again.  Where did this idea originate and is there any truth to it?  Here’s what to know about if inspectors come.\nWhere did the Republicans get that number from?\nThe 87,000 figure comes from a Treasury report released in May 2021 that evaluated a proposal to provide the IRS with additional funding of $80 billion.  That amount of money has already been passed, cou…",

Yet, the ship is still not ready to deploy. \nAfter pouring nearly $300 million into its repairs, the service says it would prefer to simply decommission the ship and move on. \nIn fact, the Navy would like to decommission the nine other vessels in this class of amphibious dock landing ships, all of which need significant repairs. Some have more than a decade of planned service life left, but the Navy says it would rather spend its money on other capabilities than attempt to repair them. \nBut the Navy isn’t the primary user of these amphibious platforms. The Marine Corps relies on these ships to carry its Marine expeditionary units, which are considered the nation’s crisis response force. But the Corps’ ability to keep forces spread across the globe and quickly react is at risk. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: There is also disagreement on what the future light amphibious ships should look like ....
