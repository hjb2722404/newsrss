Austin's hospitalization, following complications from a procedure, was not disclosed to senior defense officials until Thursday. The delayed notification puzzled officials across the government, and Austin issued an apology, taking responsibility for the lack of disclosure.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Last month, the United States restricted visas to officials from Uganda who implement a new law that carries potential death sentences for homosexual relations.\nPresident Joe Biden promised on taking office in 2021 to advocate forcefully at home and abroad for LGBTQ rights, although US diplomats often say a quiet approach is more effective.",

(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post)\n\n \nWashington Post: Obama, worried about Trump, urges Biden circle to bolster campaign \nThe former president shared his thoughts about the reelection campaign during a private lunch with Biden at the White House \nFormer president Barack Obama has raised questions about the structure of President Biden’s reelection campaign, discussing the matter directly with Biden and telling the president’s aides and allies the campaign needs to be empowered to make decisions without clearing them with the White House, according to three people familiar with the conversations. \nObama grew “animated” in discussing the 2024 election and former president Donald Trump’s potential return to power, one of the people said, and has suggested to Biden’s advisers that the campaign needs more top-level decision-makers at its headquarters in Wilmington, Del. — or it must empower the people already in place. Obama has not recommended specific individuals, but he has mentioned David Plouffe, who managed Obama’s 2008 race, as the type of senior strategist needed at the Biden campaign. \nObama’s conversation with Biden on the subject took place during a private lunch at the White House in recent months, one of the people said, a meeting that has not been previously reported. Biden, who has long used Obama as a sounding board, invited his former boss to lunch, and the two discussed a range of topics including the 2024 election. \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Report: Obama Worried About 2024 Biden Campaign, Aides Dish on Tension Between Camps (Red State)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Former President Obama's concerns are genuine.
