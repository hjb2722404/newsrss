But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

The siblings, aged 13, 9, 4, as well as a now 12-month-old baby, survived the impact.\n(Reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Oliver Griffin; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

Alexander Mercouris gives his updates on the war below.\nIt appears that after a few days of fighting Ukrainian forces have been able to advance along some parts of the front-lines, but the casualty numbers and equipment losses are staggering. Thousands killed and wounded, and hundreds of armored and other military vehicles destroyed. \nBut what is shocking is that even with these heavy losses, they still have not reached any of the Russian fortified lines. \nAn army that is advancing against fortified and prepared positions will always suffer heavy losses.

Having taken seriously President Joe Biden’s pledge to defend the island, Beijing also struck pre-emptively at U.S. and allied air bases and ships in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. managed to even the odds for a time by deploying more sophisticated submarines as well as B-21 and B-2 stealth bombers to get inside China’s air defense zones, but Washington ran out of key munitions in a matter of days and saw its network access severed. The United States and its main ally, Japan, lost thousands of servicemembers, dozens of ships, and hundreds of aircraft. Taiwan’s economy was devastated. And as a protracted siege ensued, the U.S. was much slower to rebuild, taking years to replace ships as it reckoned with how shriveled its industrial base had become compared to China’s.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Taking a quote from the above Politico article, it is always about the money .... “We could throw a trillion dollars a year at the defense budget now, and we’re not going to get a meaningful increase in traditional military capabilities in the next five years.” (Christian Brose, chief strategy officer, Anduril Industries).",
