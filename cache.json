At first, around the shores, the continental shelf is little more than an extension of the adjoining landmass. But then one reaches the edge of the abyss and, with the sudden drop that follows, everything changes. Remarkably, in view of what is known about the rest of the planet, and even outer space, most of the ocean floor remains largely a mystery. The scientific consensus is that only 5% of the deep sea has been explored in any detail. When a passenger jet was lost somewhere in the Indian Ocean in 2014, rescuers floundered without definitive maps of the maritime space and its currents at different depths that might have helped in their search.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2024/03/07/36184\">Read the full story, “Into the Abyss: The Scramble for the Ocean Floor”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>",

          "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 31,000 soldiers defending the country from Russia's invasion have been killed, in what is the country's first official figure for military casualties in more than two years of fighting. \n\"I don't want to mention the number of wounded,\" Zelensky said at a press conference on Sunday. U.S. and Russian officials had previously said between 100,000 and 300,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the conflict, figures which Zelensky dismissed as \"nonsense.\" \nZelensky meanwhile put Russian losses at 180,000 dead and 500,000 wounded.",
