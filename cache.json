ADNOC also signed a memorandum of understanding to make more deliveries next year. An ensuing trip to Qatar didn’t immediately yield any more deals. \nSecuring additional supplies is crucial for Germany after the Kremlin shut down a key pipeline. Officials have grown increasingly concerned about blackouts and rationing this winter, and the economy is hurtling toward a recession. The deal announced Sunday shows how difficult it will be for the country to get more gas in the near-term.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: So much for this summer's reassurances from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his ministers that they would succeed in finding alternatives to Russian gas. They lied. But at least he got one tanker from Qatar, and maybe a few more next year, albeit at a record high price.",
