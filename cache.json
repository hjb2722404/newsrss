Russian state propaganda is built around the myth of a Ukraine in the hands of \"Nazis\", one where the Russians come to \"liberate\" the \"Russian speakers\". This propaganda is disseminated not only in Russia, but also in the occupied Ukrainian territories, where the population is plunged into a parallel reality. FRANCE 24's reporter Elena Volochine went to meet locals and exposed the terrifying real-life consequences of Russian propaganda on the ongoing war in Ukraine.",

The French baguette has been added to UNESCO's list of cultural treasures known as 'intangible heritage'. The idea of the register is to protect traditions and skills, such as Belgian beer culture or Neapolitan pizza, so they are not lost over time. But if the French baguette is so popular, why does it need protecting? And how do you make a baguette? We take a closer look.",

          "description": "Dreaming of a European diploma, and of eventually working in the European Union, many students – most of them African – spend thousands of dollars a year to study in universities in Northern Cyprus. Many of these students were reeled in by recruiters who get a hefty sum from these institutions. However, once the students actually get to Northern Cyprus, their dreams crumble. Some are barred from even entering the country. And things aren’t much better for those who do make it in, many of whom are surprised to learn that the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is not actually considered part of the EU. Our Observers told us about the dubious methods employed by a system that values profit above all else.",

I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at.\"\nThe White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were \"not true.\"\nMusk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.\nThe world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.\nHe also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.\nIan Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine.

Natalia Gavrilita: First of all, the attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. These attacks have already caused two nationwide power cuts, one on November 15, 2022, and one a week ago. Today, we heard about new potential attacks, including ones targeting the nearby region of Odesa.\nI think that the greatest threats we face relate to energy security — among other things — because of the supply line via Ukraine as we don't have any high-voltage transmission lines that can be connected to the Romanian grid. We are working on this and hope to have a joint high-voltage transmission line in 2024. Until then, we remain very vulnerable. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It is going to be a tough winter in Moldova .... Ukraine war: Moldova braces for blackouts (BBC).

All of my relatives in Ukraine are now dependent on me for a remittance to survive. And they are the lucky ones. \nThe official inflation rate is around 25%, but they tell me that for the basics like food and fuel prices have more than doubled. \nBefore the war Ukraine was already having problems paying the loans and debts that it has accumulated since 2014. Ukraine is certainly not going to be able to pay-off the debt that it has accumulated since the start of the war, and it certainly does not have the resources to rebuild the country when the war is over. \nWhat is also ominous is that all of Ukraine's youth know this. Even if the war should end today, they have no desire to stay in a broken country that will take generations of hardship to pay-off its debts and rebuild the country. Everyone under 30 that I know in Ukraine have either left the country, or will (in the case of the men) when the conflict is over.",
