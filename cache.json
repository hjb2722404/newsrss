John Kasich about the latest developments from the House Select Committee Investigating the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nKasich also served nine terms in Congress, rising to chair the Budget Committee before he vacated his seat to unsuccessfully run for president in 2000.\n\"Gov. Kasich, does this feel from your perspective like a potential turning point, at least for some Republicans?\" Blitzer asked.\n \"Oh yeah. he's taking on water,\" Kasich said, suggesting the imagery of a sinking ship.\n\"And he's shrinking,\" he continued. \"You know, I said the other day he reminds me of the Wicked Witch of the West,  when they threw a bucket of water on her she started melting.\"\n\"And I feel that he's melting, he is losing influence and there are people beginning to say, 'You know what? Whether I believe all these details or not, this is not our guy.' The other thing I think needs to be made clear is in regards to this woman's testimony, Cassidy Hutchinson, if people are going to take shots at her, they should be forced do it under oath,\" he said. \"If they don't agree with her story, with what she's been able to recount, fine. Testify under oath.\"\n\"The other thing is, Gloria [Borger], can you believe this guy trying to go to the Capitol to overturn the election? It is beyond reprehensible. It's hard for me to believe in our country we would've had somebody doing this, but this guy has done so much. I never felt he was fit for the office and it's all proven out to be true, unfortunately,\" he said.\nWatch:\n\n\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nwww.youtube.com",

But nine months after the filmmakers‚Äô first visit to the school, the New York Times published reports of physical abuse, tampered transcripts and ‚Äúbigoted‚Äù behavior from its founders, Mike and Tracey Landry.  ‚ÄúAccepted‚Äù viewers get a front-row seat to experience the shattering impact of the school‚Äôs collapse through the stories of four promising high school students: Adia, Alicia, Cathy and Issac.\nAs we watch both the documentary‚Äôs subjects ‚Äî and its director ‚Äî navigate shocking real-time development, a quiet probing film emerges that pierces the mythos of America‚Äôs meritocracy.\n\n\nChen makes the choice to walk at the same measured pace throughout ‚Äî even after the TM Landry scandal came to light ‚Äî and forgo the cryptic notation we‚Äôre used to hearing when the jig is up.  Likewise, Chen and Daphne Qin Wu‚Äôs cinematography seamlessly oscillates between intimate handheld shots and aerial views of western Louisiana landscapes that reflect the eventual loss of access to the Landrys and the ‚Äòschool.\n\n\nUltimately, it‚Äôs the resilience of the film‚Äôs teenage subjects that elevates ‚ÄúAccepted‚Äù to new heights.  As they sit for close-ups in front of a swirling blue backdrop, the Georgetown and Stanford sweatshirts are gone, and the hopes they once held.  But in their place is a clear understanding of the misguided pressures on individual minority students to succeed in a society that systematically disadvantages them, and a surprisingly powerful story about peace with imperfection.\nAccepted\nUnclassified.
