She was 96 years old.\nShe died “peacefully sleeping at home in Los Angeles” on Tuesday morning, Michael A. McConnell of Zero Gravity Management said in a statement on behalf of her three children.  Lansbury would turn 97 in just five days.\nThroughout her 80-year career, Lansbury has starred on the big screen, television and on stage.  She has won five Tony Awards, most recently in 2009 for her role in the Broadway revival of “Blithe Spirit”. \n\nLansbury starred in Disney’s 1991 animated musical “Beauty and the Beast”, voicing Mrs.  Potts, but is perhaps best known for starring as mystery writer Jessica Fletcher in the CBS hit “Murder, She Wrote,” which ran from 1984 to 1996. \nBefore her television career, she was considered one of the last movie stars of Hollywood’s golden age, CBS Los Angeles  reported.
