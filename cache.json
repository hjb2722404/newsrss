          "description": "FRANCE 24 spoke to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Gloomy economic forecasts have cast a long shadow over this year's event in the Swiss Alps. But Georgieva said that although the IMF projects 2023 to be \"a difficult year\" and for growth to fall further, \"we don't expect a global recession\". She cited resilient labour markets and consumer spending, the post-Covid reopening of China and signs of inflation trending downwards.",

Although French people arguably have striking down to a fine art, on closer inspection, the figures debunk the myth. So why is the stereotype of a nation on strike so hard to shake off?

Tens of thousands are likely to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD, a condition for which only a few medical establishments in Ukraine are able to offer modern treatments. The most prominent among them, Forest Glade just outside Kyiv, launched a programme on Thursday to help share its expertise. FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg reports.",

          "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may be able to generate beguiling images, \"deepfake\" video and passable high-school essays, but Australian musician Nick Cave is deeply unimpressed with their song-writing skills.\nCave, whose decades-long career has been built on macabre lyrics and emotional stage performances, was asked by a fan to assess the merits of a work created in his style with ChatGPT.\nThe chatbot by OpenAI has been making headlines around the world for its ability to generate essays, news articles and other prose from short prompts.\nThe Cave fan, named as Mark from Christchurch in New Zealand on Cave's website, asked the tool to produce a song \"in the style of Nick Cave\".\nOne of the AI-created verses runs: \"I'm the king of the abyss, I'm the ruler of the dark / I'm the one that they fear, in the shadows they hark.\"\n\"This song sucks,\" wrote Cave in response, calling ChatGPT's work \"replication as travesty\".\nHe followed up with a detailed argument about what makes a good song and what doesn't, describing the process of writing as \"an act of self-murder\".\n\"Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don't feel,\" he wrote.\nHe added: \"Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit.\"\nCave allowed only one concession to the AI-penned couplets, writing that one line did speak to him -- \"I've got the fire of hell in my eyes.\"\n\"I have got the fire of hell in my eyes -- and it's ChatGPT,\" he concluded.\n© 2023 AFP",

But Fractures Are Emerging \nWASHINGTON — The billions of dollars in new arms for Ukraine announced this month — including British tanks, American fighting vehicles and howitzers from Denmark and Sweden — are testament to President Vladimir V. Putin’s failure to split the NATO allies after nearly a year of war. But small yet significant fractures are getting too big to hide. \nThe differences are over strategy for the coming year and the more immediate question of what Ukraine needs in the next few months, as both sides in the war prepare for major offensives in the spring. And while most of those debates take place behind closed doors, Britain’s impatience with the current pace of aid and Germany’s refusal to provide Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine broke out into public view this week.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. If Ukraine loses the war and/or be forced to make serious concessions to Russia to end the conflict, some NATO members will be re-evaluating their position in NATO. This is why NATO cannot afford to lose this conflict, or even have the perception of losing the conflict. The geopolitical consequences to the NATO and specifically the US will be devastating and long lasting.",

We may not be your cup of tea,” Karp said. “To make society work, there are basic functions that have to work, one of which is the reduction of terrorism, pushing back on, in my view, human rights abuses largely done by adversaries to the West. You may not agree with that, and bless you. Don’t work here.”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Palantir has been on my radar when I first heard what they are doing years ago.
