          "description": "[Sponsored Article]\r  \r \r Thanks to the rise of smartphones and mobile technology, consumers are increasing their use of digital payment acceptance methods such as credit cards, mobile payment apps, and other forms of contactless payment methods to pay for everything, from big-ticket items to groceries and bus fares. It is more important than ever for small businesses to ensure they are not falling behind on the cashless trend.\r \r Over the past two years, the pandemic has accelerated this transformation, with Hong Kong seeing its largest drop in cash usage.

Many of these SMBs are eager to adopt digital payment methods, and many now understand the benefits to their business when providing this option for customers. \r \r \"Setting up a point-of-sale terminal seemed daunting at first when we considered accepting digital payments,\" says Koyi Chan, owner of flower shop Botanic Union. \"But it turned out to be less of a hassle than expected.\" \r \r \"Allowing our customers to pay digitally has had a huge impact on our business, especially during the Christmas season when people shop for Christmas trees and flowers at our shop and on our website.

          "description": "(Reuters) - Russia's Duma has indefinitely stopped broadcasting live plenary sessions to protect information from \"our enemy\", a leading lawmaker said on Tuesday as parliament's lower house debated topics related to the war in Ukraine.\n\"Those questions that require sensitive discussion in a narrow professional circle should not be the property of our enemy,\" Vladimir Vasilyev, head of the dominant United Russia faction, told the military news channel Zvezda TV.\nRussia uses the term \"special military operation\" to describe what Ukraine and its Western allies say is a war of imperial conquest. Moscow says the West is engaged in a proxy war against it by hitting its economy with sanctions and providing Ukraine with cash, weapons and intelligence.\nThe move meant there was no live broadcast on the Duma website or social media of Tuesday's session, where deputies were due to consider a report from Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin on the process of moving civilians to Russia from the Russian-occupied Kherson region of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are waging a counter-offensive.\nThey were also due to consider a draft law that would allow the Defence Ministry to mobilise people who have committed grave crimes into the armed forces - repealing an existing ban on calling up criminals.\nAnother deputy, Andrei Svintsov, said the broadcast restriction was imposed because most issues under discussion at the moment related to the \"special military operation\". He said live public broadcasts would resume once it was over.\n\"Deputies ask questions and get quite frank answers. We understand that there may be some sensitive information from government representatives, from deputies,\" Svintsov said.\n(Reported by Filipp Lebedev; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)",

Thus far, none of the possible targets have been hacked or breached. \n“The FBI is being considerably more proactive,” a senior U.S. official told the Post. “It’s part of a larger move that the FBI isn’t waiting for the attack to occur. They’re increasingly trying to prevent.”\nThe official explained that scanning a network is likely part of a “comprehensive broad campaign” against the targets. “This is what they do.”\nThe FBI said that they visited at least a dozen Republican Party headquarters offices. Agents spoke to Democratic parties in several states, but apparently didn't visit them personally. \n\"The DNC and state parties have been in contact with the FBI,” the official said. “There is no evidence that any systems have been compromised.”\n“The RNC remains secure and we have not been compromised,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Emma Vaughn said in a statement to the Post. “Cybersecurity remains a top priority for the entire Republican ecosystem, which is why we place a premium on ensuring our stakeholders have the necessary tools, resources and training on best practices so that our Party remains protected and vigilant.” \nALSO IN THE NEWS: Marjorie Taylor Greene serves notice to Kevin McCarthy that he needs to hand her 'a lot of power' \nSee the full report at the Washington Post.",

          "description": "President Biden says the conservative Supreme Court majority and extremist Republicans are about to discover women’s political power.\nVideo of President Biden:\n\nThe president said: “With Dobbs’ decision, the court actually dared women to move on, lead, be heard. In my opinion, one of the most unusual parts of the decision was when most wrote, “Women are not without Suffrage or political rights”. Let me tell you one thing. The courts and extreme Republicans have spent decades trying to overthrow Luo. They’ll know in a minute.”\nBiden later added: “The only way to stop these extremist laws that endanger women’s health and rights is for Congress to pass a law, I said in court nearly 50 years ago that Roy was right and I believe Congress should codify Roy once and for all.”\nBiden said that if more Democrats are elected to the House and Senate, “If we do that, here’s the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. When Congress passes it, and I will sign it in January, 50 years after Roy first decided the land law, “Together we will restore the right of choice for every woman on this land.  “\nSpeaker Pelosi dismisses Andre Mitchell’s GOP talking points on midterms When Mitchell tried to claim that voters were more interested in the economy and crime than choice.\nBiden is right. Republicans are about to discover the political power of women who make up the majority of the country, and when they flex their political muscle, the repercussions will be felt across the country.\nPolls have consistently underestimated women’s turnout in special elections. If the trend continues on Election Day, the president will be vindicated and Democrats can retain their one or two majorities in Congress.\n\nSource: Politicususa.com",

The menu’s hearty southern and northern Italian dishes are suited to the “country” theme and “meant to be shared,” its website says.  \nBut the president of Meridian Retail Leasing, James Famularo, who negotiated the lease for Campagnola owner Curt Huegel said Huegel “relyed on a talented designer, Delphine Mauroit, owner of DMDesign & Architecture, to capture the soul and vibe of the original” – possibly including the original bar, furniture and artwork.\nThe new space in a former yoga studio at the base of the tower will have 3,400 “perfect L-shaped” square feet on the ground, Famularo said, plus 2,000 square feet in the basement.  The configuration allows the dining room to occupy the entire ground floor.\nHe couldn’t discuss the terms due to a nondisclosure agreement.  The move is expected to take place in about nine months.\nThe owner was replaced by Brandon Singer of MONA leasing, a brokerage firm backed by RFR.\nHuegel’s company, Host Restaurants, owns several major locations in and out of town.  Among them is the Sefton Bar/Lounge opposite the original Campagnola – a lease which Famularo also managed.\nHuegel was always known for restaurantsnot for the bars – but Famularo said he got the idea from Sefton when he noticed many Campagnola customers were looking for drinks nearby while waiting for their tables.\n\nSource Link",
