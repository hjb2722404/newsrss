          "description": "Two days after the second coup d’état in Burkina Faso in less than a year, FRANCE 24 journalist Wassim Nasr locates the origins of the new putsch in a jihadist attack in the country’s north that caused “turmoil in the ranks of the military” – echoing a progression from two attacks that preceded the first coup. Nasr also explains how Burkinabe army captain Ibrahim Traore tapped into anti-French sentiment to mobilise supporters in Ouagadougou following his announcement that junior officers were ousting junta leader Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba.",

          "description": "Stock market movements over the next few weeks will be key in determining whether we are heading into a short-term or long-term recession, according to forex trader and crypto analyst Alessio Rastani.\nDuring the period October-December 2022, the analyst expects to see the S&P recover.  “If this bounces back or the rally fails and comes back down, then most likely we are entering a long-term recession and something very close to similar to 2008,” Rastani said in the latest Cointelegraph interview. \nAccording to the analyst, such a recession could last until 2024 and would inevitably negatively impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC). \nSpeaking about the latest pound crisis, Rastani believed that its main cause is the rally in the US dollar, which is putting pressure on most other fiat currencies, including the yen and the euro.  However, according to Rastani, the US dollar is approaching the top. \n“Once we see a clear break, a sustained break of the 111.5 and 110 levels on the dollar index, then I think the dollar is at the top. And then I’m looking for a multi-month decline in the dollar at 104 at the 100 level on the dollar index,” he explained. \nCheck complete maintenance on our Youtube channel and don’t forget to subscribe! \n\n\nSource Link",
