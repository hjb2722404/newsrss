The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.\n\"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids,\" said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.\nThe protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.\nNational police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.\nThe now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and \"will not yield to any political pressure on the matter\".\nNetanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.\n\"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister',\" said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.\n(Writing by Dan Williams; editing by John Stonestreet)",

The country stands for evil, he said. \"It has become synonymous with terror and will be an example of defeat and just punishment for its terror. The Kremlin cannot stop the punishment.\"\nZelensky mentioned several cities and regions that had been particularly affected by fresh Russian attacks. He said the Kharkiv region alone had seen 40 missile attacks since the beginning of the year. In the city of Kherson, he said, three Ukrainians were killed by Russian fire on Saturday — on their way to do their shopping.",

The website offers you access to original articles, fascinating podcasts with insightful guests, virtual and in-person events, and other resources to help illuminate this complex form of conflict. All IWI content is generated by members from the IW community — like you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDemand for IWI content has only increased over the past three years since our first podcast released. The new website is one part of a plan to grow IWI as a platform to meet this increased demand and to continue providing valuable resources to the IW professional community. We hope you enjoy the new website, and encourage you to continue helping us build this community. There are many ways to support: submitting an article, joining the team as a volunteer, planning an event in partnership with IWI, donating (even small contributions help!) or making a purchase from the IWI store, or simply continuing to follow IWI content and sharing it with other irregular warfare professionals in your network. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn behalf of the more than 50 volunteers who have worked incredibly hard to make this new website and the content it supports possible, we thank you for your continued support and engagement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Doug Livermore & Charles Faint\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n      Dave Maxwell\nSat, 03/11/2023 - 9:21am\n\nRead more about Irregular Warfare Initiative Launches New Website\nLog in or register to post comments",

According to military observers, this air defense boat was modified and converted from the British Bladerunner.

The idea is to use an air-to-air missile with a nose that bends to get at the target before it can get away. The service views this as one path to giving current and future combat aircraft, including a sixth-generation stealth jet being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance program, a new way to engage increasingly maneuverable threats. \nThe Air Force Research Laboratory highlighted what is formally known as the Missile Utility Transformation via Articulated Nose Technology (MUTANT) project at this week's 2023 Air and Space Forces Association's Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado. AFRL says that MUTANT leverages work that has been done over the past six years on related technologies, but notes the core concept takes advantage of related research and experimentation dating back all the way to the 1950s.   \nRead more .... \nUpdate: US Air Force's New MUTANT Missile Can Bend Its Nose!
