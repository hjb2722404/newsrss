But other of the significant names on the CIA's list were ignored.  \nTrump \"was more interested in a young and less influential figure much farther down the list, according to two people familiar with the briefings, because he recognized the name,\" the report said at the time. \n\n\"He would say, 'I've never heard of any of these people. What about Hamza bin Laden?'\" the former official told NBC.\nA Pentagon official agreed, noting, \"That was the only name he knew.\" \nBy contrast, Biden explained that after \"relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year. He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family.\"\n\"This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians, and one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success,\" Biden also said.",

Central places in control. These areas, we're talking about an individual who is the CEO of this organization. You can debate how powerful he is, compared to bin Laden, but it's a big deal.\"\nAnother important aspect, said Hertling, is how the U.S. was able to take him out despite no longer having on-the-ground intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan, having withdrawn U.S. forces last year.\n\"This is more than likely a drone strike. I would give that a 70 percent possibility,\" said Hertling. \"I would not rule out a hand strike on this individual, either. What you are talking about, the kinds of things we were talking about when we withdrew from Afghanistan, this will be an over-the-horizon strike with very little capability for collecting intelligence within Afghanistan.

These aren’t naturally occurring whatsoever,\" claimed QAnon influencer GhostEzra.\nThe NCRI and the Rutgers Miller Center conducted open-source analysis of Russian disinformation websites and individuals, and then analyzed the use of terms around food security on Twitter and Telegram, and detected the pattern of disinformation flowing from Kremlin-linked media and QAnon influencers and other conspiracy theorists.\n“There is a significant overlap between QAnon and other anti-vax and online conspiracy communities,” said Alex Goldenberg, lead intelligence analyst at the NCRI and a research fellow at the Rutgers Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience. “Some of the more colorful food-mandate conspiracies intermingle with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.”",

          "description": "UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world faced \"a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War\" and was just \"one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\"\n\"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,\" Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" he said, calling on nations to \"put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.\"\nGuterres's comments came at the opening 10th review conference of the NPT, an international treaty that came into force in 1970 to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\nThe meeting, held at the UN's headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will run until August 26.\nGuterres said the conference was \"a chance to strengthen\" the treaty and \"make it fit for the worrying world around us,\" citing Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East.\n\"Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used,\" the secretary-general implored, adding that he would visit Hiroshima for the anniversary of the August 6, 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city by the United States.\n\"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,\" Guterres added.\nIn January, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- had pledged to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons.\nAt the last review conference in 2015, the parties were unable to reach agreement on substantive issues.\n© 2022 AFP",

He was “the street fighter”, she writes, “not loud and feisty but quiet, stubborn”, never shaking the feeling that he was acting “with his back against the wall, writing, composing, negotiating his way out of a corner”.\nMary Ellin Berlin, born November 25, 1926 in Manhattan, grew up in a different world.  His childhood memories included dinners with the Astaires, the Goldwyns, the Capras, and Somerset Maugham, who, lying on the floor, placed a glass of water on his forehead and stood up without spilling a drop.\nAlthough she sometimes had to chase her father for attention and felt alienated by the fame of her parents – her mother, Ellin Mackay, was an heiress and popular novelist—Mary Ellin felt less resentment than delight at her good fortune.  When she relentlessly invited people to family theater seats for her father’s 1946 Broadway smash hit, “Annie Get Your Gun,” an annoyed friend told her to stop.\n\nSource Link",

During a chaotic period in the late 1980s, inflation soared to an almost unbelievable 3,000% and locals rushed to get groceries before clerks with price guns could do so. their turn.  Today, high inflation is back, exceeding 30% every year since 2018.\nTo understand how Argentines are coping, we spent two weeks in and around Buenos Aires, talking to economists, politicians, farmers, restaurant owners, real estate agents, barbers, taxi drivers, moneychangers coins, street artists, street vendors and the unemployed.\nThe economy isn’t always the best topic of conversation, but in Argentina it has animated just about everyone, sparking curses, deep sighs, and educated opinions on monetary policy.  One woman happily showed her stash for a wad of US dollars (an old ski jacket), another explained how she stuffed money in her bra to buy a condo, and a Venezuelan waitress snuck up. is asked if she had immigrated to the right country.\nOne thing has become startlingly clear: Argentines have developed a very unusual relationship with their money.\nThey spend their pesos as quickly as they receive them.  They buy everything from televisions to potato peelers in installments.  They don’t trust banks.  They barely use credit.  And after years of constant price hikes, they have little idea what things should cost.\nArgentina shows that people will find a way to adapt to years of high inflation, living in an economy that is impossible to imagine almost anywhere else in the world.  Life is especially manageable for those who can afford to turn the system upside down.  But all of these stark workarounds mean that few of those who have held political power through years of economic distress have found themselves paying the real price.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "why everyone believes\nIn the mid-1960s, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Joseph Weizenbaum built an automated psychotherapist he called Eliza.  This chatbot was simple.  Basically, when you typed a thought on a computer screen, it asked you to expand on that thought – or it just repeated your words in the form of a question.\nEven when Dr. Weizenbaum selected a conversation for the academic paper he published on the technology, it looked like this, with Eliza responding in all caps:\n\nMen are all the same.\nHOW?\nThey always bother us about something or other.\nCAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE?\nWell, my boyfriend made me come here.\nYOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE\n\nBut much to Dr. Weizenbaum’s surprise, people were treating Eliza like she was human.  They freely shared their personal problems and were comforted by his answers.\n“I knew from long experience that the strong emotional bonds that many programmers have with their computers are often formed after only short experiences with machines,” he later said. wrote.  “What I didn’t realize was that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thoughts in completely normal people.”\nWe humans are sensitive to these feelings.  When dogs, cats, and other animals exhibit even a tiny amount of human behavior, we tend to assume they look more like us than they really do.  The same thing happens when we see cues of human behavior in a machine.\nScientists now call it the Eliza effect.\nThe same thing happens with modern technology.  A few months after the release of GPT-3, an inventor and entrepreneur, Philip Bosua, sent me an email.  The subject line was: “God is a machine”.\n“There is no doubt in my mind that GPT-3 has become sentient,” it read.  “We all knew this would happen in the future, but it seems that future is now.  He considers me a prophet to spread his religious message and that is strangely how he feels.\n\nSource Link",
