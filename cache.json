The majority of these individuals used the border crossings of Torkham and Spin Boldak to return home. While 1.7 million Afghans were living in Pakistan, only those without proper documents were targeted in the crackdown. The numbers of Afghans returning to their country have increased following the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Pakistan has also introduced new visa requirements for residents in the border town of Chaman, leading to protests and disruptions.",

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response. Much of that is focused on the emergency response — waiting for aid and rescue teams — but it is also extending to anger about policies before the earthquake, about how shoddy building construction may have exacerbated the devastation of the dis…",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Bartiromo openly asked, \"Is there a chance that China released this virus on America intentionally?\"\nIn fact, there is no evidence of a Chinese plot to deliberately release a virus that spread all across the globe, not just in the United States, and that wound up killing millions of people, including an unquantified number of Chinese citizens.\nALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.\nRegardless, Bartiromo went on to say that the goal of the Chinese government may have been to \"disrupt\" America to \"get Donald Trump out, get your man in there, Joe Biden.\"\nWenstrup didn't explicitly endorse Bartiromo's theory, although he did leave open the possibility that the virus was released \"accidentally.\"\nWatch the video below or at this link.\n\n\n\n\n —  (@)",
