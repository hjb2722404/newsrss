Brown's speech at this year's Air & Space Forces Association's mega conference outside of Washington, D.C., the soon-to-be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs dropped two new images of the B-21 Raider. While the stealth bomber was rolled out in December of last year, it remains cloaked in secrecy. Brown, the top Air Force uniformed officer, didn't specifically reference the images in his presentation. \nUp until today, only one angle of the full aircraft has been seen by the public — head-on — and in a very controlled environment at the bomber's unveiling. Aside from a close-up of the cockpit area at an angle, all imagery published since then has been from the same head-on perspective, although it has progressively shown the aircraft in more detail. Now we have our first quartering view of the flying-wing jet, which provides significant details about its design. A new head-on image also gives us a better idea of the bomber's actual size. Both images were taken at Northrop Grumman's facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. \n\n \nRead more .... \nNew Images Emerge Of The B-21\n\n \nCSAF Shows Off New Images of the B-21; Raider Begins Engine Runs -- Air & Space Forces \nB-21 Raider stealth bomber: New images show US Air Force’s £585m cutting-edge aircraft -- The Independent\n \nNew B-21 photos released, as engine runs begin -- Breaking Defense\n \nNew Photos Offer Rare Glimpse at US' Classified B-21 Stealth Bomber -- Sputnik",

          "description": "US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the NATO Summit © Provided by The Telegraph\n\n \nThe Telegraph: Ukraine’s counter-offensive is stalling. The West must prepare for humiliation \nTime is running out for Ukraine. After 18 months of war, it is no longer a question of if the Western alliance will falter, but when. Since the start, despite making many of the right noises and supplying some military hardware, France and Germany, in particular, have been reluctant partners. Their leaders have often seemed more concerned with finding an “off-ramp” for Vladimir Putin than ejecting his forces from Ukraine. As well as dependency on Russian energy, a pacifist instinct among Western European political classes has led to neglect of their armed forces and a corresponding fear of escalation. \nAs the provider of the lion’s share of backing for Ukraine, it is the US calling the shots in this war. Yet, since the earliest days, President Biden, too, has been dragging his heels, giving just about enough military assistance to keep Ukraine fighting, but intentionally not enough to enable a victory.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The above author (Colonel Richard Kemp) is a fervent supported of Ukraine, and that is why his commentary is an eye-opener. \nBottom line. \nThe West has to escalate their involvement in the war even more by significantly ramping up military aid to Ukraine and increasing economic pressure on Russia. If not, Western public support for the war will continue to decrease, and the likelihood of a Ukraine victory is all but unlikely.",

          "description": "WNU Editor: For more info on the above video .... Mysterious 9/11 video that emerged on YouTube 20 years after atrocity (Mirror). \nWNU Editor: I was in my office 22 years ago when I noticed that the browser on my computer was very slow. I was trying to load CNN, and it would just not load. My guess was that CNN's servers had crashed, but I could not load any other news services like the BBC, CBC, France24, AP, etc.. That was when I knew something was wrong. \nI was finally able to load some news from the CBC, and it was then that I knew what was happening. While wondering how could a passenger plane pilot make such a catastrophic mistake, news of a second plane hitting the next tower was being reported. I knew right away that the U.S. was under a coordinated attack, and I made the decision to go home. \nWhile driving home I called my brother who was living in California to tell him that the U.S. mainland was under attack. After a minute my connection to him died. I learned later from my brother that when I called him I actually woke him up (it was 6:45am his time), and by telling him that New York and Washington were under attack his first thought was that a nuclear attack was underway. \nGetting home I had 3 VCRs, and I started to record the news from the CBC, ABC News, and NBC. I knew history was happening, and I wanted my own archive. I recorded the news from those channels for the next 36 hours, and when finished I took the tapes and put them aside to look at them later. \nTwenty-two years later, I took the tapes out last night, and watched some of it for the first time. \nSighhhh .... \nIt does not get old. It feels like yesterday.",
