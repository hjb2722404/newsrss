He was 94. Ramos became a hero to many for defecting from Marcos' government, where he led the national police force, spurring the dictator's downfall during the 1986 popular uprising against his rule.

Iraq has been without a president and prime minister for a record period because of the deadlock.\nSadr maintains large state power himself because his movement remains involved in running the country - his loyalists sit in powerful positions throughout Iraqi ministries and state bodies.\nIraqis linked neither to Sadr nor to his opponents say they are caught in the middle of the political gridlock.\nWhile Baghdad earns record income from its vast oil wealth, the country has no budget, regular power and water cuts, poor education and healthcare, and insufficient job opportunities for the young.\n(Reporting by Reuters TV in Baghdad and Amina Ismail in Erbil; Writing by John Davison; Editing by Helen Popper)",

Prince William had started the presentation, but Williamson, the captain of the England women’s football team, knew that, just this once, royalty might be forced to wait.  She took a breath.  She stared absently at her ponytail.  She looked at her teammates, the podium and the trophy, just a little in disbelief.\nIt wasn’t until she was absolutely sure she was ready that she started the walk: the one no one has done for more than half a century and sometimes it seemed like no one would do it again. never.  Now there she was, a 25-year-old from Milton Keynes, a town that has long been used as a synonym for bland, strolling to fame and down in history.\n\nEngland’s wait for their national football team to lift a major trophy…",

What they find instead is a Falstaff who might have come out of a formal painted portrait: a balding, elderly knight with tufts of silver hair and mustaches. sparse, a huge belly, rosy cheeks and squinting frog eyes peering through boozy mists.The sight is so eerie that you cling to your seat.\n“You realize,” Mr. Rich continued, “that it is the character of Shakespeare, and not a parody of camp, that is being served.”\nPatricia Ann Carroll was born May 5, 1927 in Shreveport, Louisiana and grew up in Los Angeles.  Her father, Maurice, worked for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Electricity;  his mother, Kathryn (Meagher) Carroll, worked in real estate and office management.\nMs Carroll attended the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles on an English scholarship, but left before she graduated.  “I realized what I was learning wasn’t going to advance what I wanted to do,” she said in 2011. “I always thought experience was the best preparation.”\nIn 1947, Ms. Carroll left Los Angeles for Plymouth, Mass., where she worked at the Priscilla Beach Theater and, she said, ate, drank and breathed the theater.  She made her professional stage debut there that year in “A Goose for the Gander”, with Gloria Swanson.  Soon after, she traveled to New York, where, among other odd jobs, she shined shoes.\n\nSource Link",
