          "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a sympathy message to his United States counterpart Joe Biden on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, a day after the 79-year-old US leader tested positive for Covid-19.\nBiden on Thursday insisted he was \"doing great\", and said he would continue to work while isolating at the White House with mild symptoms.\n\"I would like to express my deep sympathies to you and wish you a speedy recovery,\" Xi wrote in the message, CCTV reported.\nIt is the first public contact between both leaders since their last virtual summit four months ago, as ties between the two global superpowers continue to deteriorate over issues including Taiwan, Ukraine and technology sector competition.\nThe pair held a video conference on March 18, when Biden warned Xi against assisting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.\nThe leaders have known each other for more than a decade, having travelled together when both were vice-presidents.\nEarlier this week, Biden said that a call with Xi would take place within the \"next ten days\", weeks after both countries' top diplomats met in an attempt to defuse escalating rhetoric over Taiwan.\nBeijing recently blasted a planned trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.\nPelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: \"Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese.\"",

          "description": "The trailers for Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” one of the summer’s most anticipated movies, have raised some intriguing questions.  Is it a western?  Horror movie?  science fiction?  Satire?  Will it live up to the expectations raised by Peele’s first two jaw-dropping surf features, “Get Out” and “We,” or confuse them?\nI can now report that the answer to all of these questions is: Yeah.  That is to say, there are fascinating internal tensions in the film, as well as impeccably managed suspense, sharp jokes, and a seductively unnerving atmosphere of general weirdness.\n“Nope” seems less polemical than “Us” or “Get Out”, more at ease in its idiosyncrasies and flights of imagination even if it follows, in the end, a more conventional narrative path.  This might be cause for some disappointment, since…",

Pelosi is now the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine during the war, with the surprise visit adding to the growing momentum behind the West’s support for the country's fight against Russia. Photo by Ukrainian Presidency via ABACAPRESS.COM    \nPolitico: Pelosi to Blinken: Label Russia as terrorist state, or else Congress will  \nHer comments highlight the chasm in the actions lawmakers want the administration to take and what the secretary is comfortable doing.  \nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi had a message for Secretary of State Antony Blinken: Designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism — otherwise, Congress will. \nThe warning, made on a call between the two earlier this week, was described to POLITICO by two sources familiar with the conversation. Spokespersons for the State Department and Pelosi’s office declined to comment. \nCongress gave the power to label another country as a state sponsor of terrorism to the secretary of state. Some in Congress, though, say lawmakers could pass a law to make the designation without the State Department, thus pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin on their own. \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Pelosi pushes Biden to label Russia as terror sponsor — or Congress will: report (NYPost)  \nUpdate #2: Pelosi reportedly pushes State Department to identify Russia as a state sponsor of terror, saying that if it won't, Congress will (Business Insider)   \nWNU Editor: The Kremlin has responded ....
