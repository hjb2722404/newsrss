Since then, many migrants have been urgently trying to return to their countries of origin. The Ivory Coast in particular has organised a repatriation of its citizens, who have had to pack up their lives and leave with just a few days' notice. Our correspondents in Tunis and Abidjan followed some of them from their hasty departure to their arrival in a country that many had left long ago.",

However, Europe's record-breaking life expectancy has a downside: in order to pay for its increasingly healthy legion of retirees, the French right wing says there's no other option but to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. The left retorts that if corporations paid their fair share in taxes, that would more than sustain the country's cherished pay-as-you-go pension system. Ahead of what unions are billing as their biggest strikes yet against the government's pension reform, what exactly does the future hold for workers?",

          "description": "A landlord in Canada changed the locks on a home and took votes from its occupants on whether one of the tenants could return, the Daily Hive reported. \nMan-Ling Weng claimed Daichi Araki owed him $4,500 in damages, which Araki disagreed with. \nDetails from a British Columbia small claims case at the Civil Resolution Tribunal say Weng became a tenant at the home in 2019 but took over rent-collecting duties in 2020 as well as other responsibilities. Araki and Weng had an unwritten agreement where Weng payed Araki $600 on a month-to-month basis. \nOn September 21, 2021, Araki allowed Weng’s friend, identified in the Hive's report as \"SJC,\" to stay in her rented bedroom. Weng then increased her rent payments from $600 to $700. Weng then took a trip to Taiwan, and SJC then signed a document post-dated May 24, allowing SJS to stay in Weng’s room to “safeguard her possessions.”\nIN OTHER NEWS: Backfire alert: GOP's anti-'wokeness' crusade could end up undermining their own candidates\nWhen Weng's return date was pushed back to 4 months later, Araki gave Weng until May 31 to move out -- even though Araki didn't initially signal any objections to the extended return date. \nAraki said Weng had “breached their contract by subleasing her room to SJC without his consent.” The court said that this contradicted Araki’s statement allowing SJC to move in.\n\"In the end, Araki was ordered to pay $40 to Weng for a partial rent refund and $130 in damages for $170,\" the Hive's report stated.",

          "description": "Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed former President Donald Trump on Monday and, apparently, omitted crucial chunks of their conversation about Ukraine when it was broadcast to Hannity's radio audience.\nJustin Baragona, the senior media reporter at The Daily Beast, noticed the discrepancy on Tuesday.\n\"According to Trump, all he needed to do was let Russia 'take over' parts of Ukraine,\" Baragona explained. \"Saying that Russia was going for the 'whole enchilada' with Joe Biden as president, Trump added that Russia 'took over nothing' while he was in the White House because Russian President Vladimir Putin 'understood' that 'he would have never done it.'\"\nTrump added, \"that's without even negotiating a deal. I could have negotiated. At worst, I could've made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could've worked a deal.\"\nBut as Baragona pointed out, that is not what Hannity played.\n\"Instead, shortly after Trump says, 'I could have negotiated,' the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that 'China no longer respects the United States,'\" Baragona observed.\nBaragona also noted that \"besides asserting that he would have stopped Russia from invading Ukraine by making a deal to let them 'take over something,' Trump also said in the portion not aired by Fox that 'so many more people are dying than is being reported' while reiterating this 'would have never happened' under his watch.\"",

Another 28 migrants traveling as families from Guatemala and El Salvador were also in the trailer, bringing the total number of passengers to 343.\nAuthorities discovered the trailer on a highway without a driver, INM said. It was outfitted with fans, a partially ventilated roof and a structure that created a second level inside the trailer.\nA photo that INM distributed showed plastic bottles and other trash strewn across the floor of the long, narrow compartment.\nThe children will be put into custody of Veracruz's family services system while the other migrants will be processed to determine their legal status in Mexico, INM said.\nEarlier this year, Mexican authorities found 57 unaccompanied minors from Guatemala at a checkpoint near the U.S.-Mexico border, and 20 other unaccompanied minors in a group of mostly Central Americans in the southern state of Chiapas.\n(Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Josie Kao)",

In early February, maritime vessels disabled the two undersea cables connecting Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, a tiny archipelago just 10 nautical miles off China’s coast, to the internet. Now residents of the islands face highly reduced internet connectivity until the cables are repaired. The activity looks like targeted harassment by Beijing—or an exercise in preparation for cutting off the whole of Taiwan. \nOn Feb. 2, a Chinese fishing vessel sailing close to the Matsu Islands severed one of the two cables, which connect the islands with Taiwan proper. Then, six days later, a Chinese freighter cut the second cable. Speaking shortly after the second cable was cut, Wong Po-tsung, the vice chair of Taiwan’s National Communications Commission, told reporters that there was no indication the incidents were intentional. It’s not uncommon for undersea cables to be damaged—but losing two in a row is either really unfortunate or quite possibly not a coincidence.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Taiwan now strongly believes these cables were deliberately cut ....
