By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. âNearly every commerciaâ¦",

Olmert said Israel should offer to start negotiations on a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority immediately after conclusion of the war. He also claimed that no Arab country would agree to replace the Israeli army in Gaza after the war, which is why he advocates a NATO-led military presence that would usher in a transitional civilian administration before final talks over a Palestinian state. Olmert slammed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, saying he had failed his citizens and boosted Hamas while weakening the Palestinian Authority: \"He is in a nervous breakdown.\"",

Real beauties,\" Trump said on stage on Saturday.\n\"General Milley is the one who decided to take the soldiers out first,\" he added. \"General Milley is the one that said let's leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind because it's cheaper than taking it out. It's cheaper than putting a tank of nice, clean fuel in the airplane and flying it to Pakistan or flying it all the way home. It's cheaper to leave it there.\"\nHe claimed 700,000 rifles, 70,000 vehicles, and more were left behind after war.\nThe ex-president added, \"We have an unbelievable military.

Strickland,\" the Vatican said in a statement.\nIt said the bishop of Austin, Joe Vasquez, had been named as apostolic administrator of the diocese, but gave no further details.\nThe Vatican has not said what sparked the apostolic visitation this summer -- which Strickland himself made public -- or what conclusions were drawn.\nBut Strickland, appointed by former pope Benedict XVI in 2012, was one of the most prominent critics of Pope Francis.\nThe Argentine pope, 86, has sought to forge a more compassionate Church, open to different views.\nBut he has faced intense opposition from critics -- particularly in the United States -- who accused him of causing confusion and failing to uphold key Catholic beliefs.\nIn a message earlier this year on X, formerly Twitter, Strickland accused the pope of \"undermining the deposit of faith\".\nIn a blog posted on his website in September, the bishop addressed rumours that he was being encouraged by the Vatican to step down.\n\"I cannot resign as bishop of Tyler because that would be me abandoning the flock\" under his care, he wrote.\n\"I have also said that I will respect the authority of Pope Francis if he removes me from office as Bishop of Tyler,\" he wrote.\n\"I love Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church which He established. My only desire is to speak His Truth and live God's Will to the best of my ability,\" he wrote.\nThe diocese of Tyler on Saturday announced the Vatican's decision to dismiss the bishop on its website, saying: \"Our work as the Catholic Church in northeast Texas continues.\"\nÂ© 2023 AFP",

The Kremlin says the conflict is part of a broader struggle with a declining West which it accuses of sowing chaos around the world to try to maintain its dominance.Â \nPatrushev said the post-Cold War order, including the dominance of the United States, was waning.\n\nÂ \nRead more ....\n\nÂ \nWNU Editor: It seems the Western press is more concerned about this than Nikolai Patrushev's worries that weapons of mass destruction may soon be used ....
