In this exclusive report shot in the rebel maquis and underground pro-democracy resistance circles, FRANCE 24 brings you an inside look at Myanmar’s civil war.

But after Putin's announcement early today that he had ordered a partial mobilization, all that I have been hearing from the leaders of NATO and countries that border Russia is nothing but rhetoric denouncing this move (see above video). \nNo calls to match Russia's partial mobilization. No calls to even declare a partial wartime industrial mobilization. Even Ukraine is silent on matching this Russian mobilization.\n\nYou can take this to the bank. \nIf the West does nothing in the coming days to say that they will match Russia's mobilization efforts, this is going to cause panic in Ukraine that the West is now abandoning them. And in the eyes of the Kremlin, another example on how weak and ineffective the West has become. \nMy prediction. \nThe West (primarily the U.S.) will announce more troop deployments to eastern Europe, and more aid to Ukraine in the coming days. But it will fall short from what Ukraine needs, and it will certainly not match what Russia is going to do.",
