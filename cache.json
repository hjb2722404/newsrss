          "description": "Albert Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie Uderzo, challenges the auction of an original cover painting from the 1963 comic book 'Asterix and Cleopatra'. The painting, expected to fetch 400,000 to 500,000 euros, shows Cleopatra with Asterix and Obelix. Sylvie Uderzo argues that the painting must have been stolen as her father would have signed and dedicated it if he had given it away. The auction house, Millon, claims to be selling the work on behalf of the son of a man who was given it by Uderzo over 50 years ago.",

The salt deposits on Mercury have similarities to salty environments on Earth, raising questions about the potential habitability of subsurface areas. The discovery also offers an explanation for craters with missing chunks, suggesting that impacts exposed and evaporated volatiles. Further investigations are needed to understand the origin of these volatile layers.",

The fossil shows the fungus infecting the ancient plant Asteroxylon mackiei, revealing a predator-prey interaction. The unique reproductive structures of Potteromyces, called conidiophores, distinguish it as a new species. A second specimen confirms its place as one of the oldest ancestors of disease-causing fungi.

By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "Former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, who has claimed his home was targeted by a break-in shortly after he published a scathing \"Anonymous\" op-ed about Trump's presidency, appeared on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta on Saturday. Acosta asked if the things Trump says he will do in a second term, such as mass deportations, another Muslim ban, and firings across the federal government, are realistic.\n\n\n\t\"It's not a stretch at all. This is how Stephen Miller, likely to be one of Trump's cabinet secretaries in a second term, described the second term to me. He specifically described day one to me: 'On day one, when we win, it will be a shock and awe blitz.' You have to take him at his word,\" Taylor said. \"What does Stephen Miller mean by that? He means in a second go-around, there won't be years of delay and indecision about whether to moderate Trump's position so he can win a second term. It will be throwing the kitchen sink at American democracy and doing all the things he's wanted to do by abusing federal power.\"\n\n\tTaylor went on to say that his biggest worry is the potential weaponization of the national security community.\n\nALSO READ: A neuroscientist explains how Donald Trump exploits the minds of conspiracy theorists\n\n\t\"If you look anywhere in history you see the most grievous abuses of power is when the army or domestic security forces are used against a leader's political enemies. And those are things that aren't just forecasts of what Trump could do. He's talked about weaponizing the spy community, to spy on his adversaries. He has talked about creating his own mercenary force within the community so he doesn't have to go through a chain of command that he worries would disobey him. He's talked about using the Department of Homeland Security to intimidate his opponents in democratic sanctuary cities and to make sure that blue states don't get aid and red states do when there's natural disasters. This is laid out very clear. We know what will happen.\"\n\nWatch the video below or click the link here.",

Trump has said repeatedly that withdrawing from NATO would save the U.S. money.\nThat's causing some panic abroad, according to the Times.\n\"In interviews over the past several months, more than a half-dozen current and former European diplomats — speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from Mr. Trump should he win — said alarm was rising on Embassy Row and among their home governments that Mr. Trump’s return could mean not just the abandonment of Ukraine, but a broader American retreat from the continent and a gutting of the Atlantic alliance,\" the article states. \nALSO READ: Why Donald Trump should absolutely fear the 14th Amendment\n\nThe Times quoted James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral who was NATO’s supreme allied commander until 2013, as saying there is a \"great fear\" in Europe about Trump's tentative plans.\nIt also reported that most officials were simply \"out of ideas\" when it comes to the Don.\n\"The interviews with current and former diplomats revealed that European officials were mostly out of ideas for how to deal with Mr. Trump other than returning to a previous playbook of flattery and transactional tributes,\" the article says. \"Smaller countries that are more vulnerable to Russian attacks are expected to try to buy their way into Mr. Trump’s good graces by increasing their orders of American weapons or — as Poland did during his term — by performing grand acts of adulation, including offering to name a military base Fort Trump in return for his placing a permanent presence there.\"\nRead the full report here.",

          "description": "US News and World Report: Biden: Help Ukraine Now or Send Americans to Fight Russia With NATO Later \nThe president warned congressional Republicans wavering on Ukraine: Provide aid now or send U.S. troops to fight Russia when Putin acts against NATO. \nPresident Joe Biden delivered his sternest warning yet to congressional Republicans balking at approving more aid to Ukraine: Pay up now or you'll pay more later, forced to send U.S. troops to fight Russian soldiers when an emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin moves in on a NATO member country. \n\"Congress needs to pass supplemental funding for Ukraine before they break for the holiday. It's as simple as that,\" Biden said at the White House as the GOP-led House mulled Biden's request for $106 billion in emergency spending, including foreign aid.\n\n\"Frankly, I think It's stunning we have gotten to this point in the first place. Republicans in Congress are willing to give Putin the greatest gift he could hope for and abandon our global leadership,\" Biden said.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The Kremlin has responded .... Kremlin accuses Biden of 'demonising' Russia to win more Ukraine money from Congress (Reuters). Russian media has a different take .... What’s really behind Biden’s threat to send Americans to fight Russia? (RT).",
