At first, around the shores, the continental shelf is little more than an extension of the adjoining landmass. But then one reaches the edge of the abyss and, with the sudden drop that follows, everything changes. Remarkably, in view of what is known about the rest of the planet, and even outer space, most of the ocean floor remains largely a mystery. The scientific consensus is that only 5% of the deep sea has been explored in any detail.

          "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is questioning whether Donald Trump is loyal to the nation he seeks to lead.\nZelensky told CNN that Trump would be \"against Americans\" if he supported Russia over Ukraine, and he said the former president did not understand the conflict or Vladimir Putin's intentions.\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt understand how Donald Trump can be on the side of Putin,\" Zelensky said. \"It's unbelievable.\"\nTrump, the clear Republican presidential frontrunner, has claimed he would end the conflict in a day if he's re-elected and he has refused to say whether he supports Russia or Ukraine in the war.\n‚ÄúI think Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt know Putin,‚Äù Zelensky said. ‚ÄúI know he met him‚Ä¶ but he never fought with Putin. (The) American army never fought with the army of Russia. Never‚Ä¶ I have a better understanding.\"\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he understands that Putin will never stop,‚Äù he added.\nLast month, President Joe Biden warned Republicans that blocking vital US military aid for Ukraine threatened the \"free world\" as talks with congressional leaders at the White House failed to produce a breakthrough.\nU.S. assistance for Ukraine has dried up with Republicans refusing to approve Biden's request for $60 billion for Kyiv until the Democrat bows to their demands for measures to curb migration over the Mexican border.\nThe bitter partisan battle has been intensified by the looming US presidential election in November, and has raised deep concerns among Western allies who fear it could harm Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion.\nBiden told the visiting House and Senate leaders that the months-long standoff \"endangers the United States' national security, the NATO alliance, and the rest of the free world,\" the White House said.\n\"The president called on Congress to quickly provide additional funding to support Ukraine and send a strong signal of US resolve. The president also made clear that we must act now to address the challenges at the border.\"",

And here's the thing. There's a lot to dislike, sort of every link of the chain here. First of all, the FBI writes down lots of things that human informants and confidential informants say. That doesn't mean it is necessarily true. Yes, they record it in a form, 1023, but they write it down. It doesn't mean it's verified, it doesn't mean it's accurate, it doesn't mean it's reliable. Once they receive it, they have to go about the hard work of corroborating it, or debunking it. And it sounds like the FBI never corroborated, and indeed, ultimately debunked this disinformation.\"\nHe continued:\n\"So why this debunked Russian disinformation would then be handed off to Republican members of Congress to be used as the basis to impeach an American president is mystifying, Ayman. And look, let's use Jim Jordan as an example. You played a clip of him appearing to double down, even though he now knows it's Russian disinformation, and Smirnov has been indicted for lying to the FBI about the Bidens. Jim Jordan is a serial abuser of his position and his authority.
