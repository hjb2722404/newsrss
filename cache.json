His remarks came during Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations on May 9 marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, are increasingly describing the fighting in Ukraine as a proxy war between the U.S. and Russia. We speak with the Quincy Institute’s Anatol Lieven, who says the war can only end through negotiations, and aggressive U.S. rhetoric risks prolonging the fighting. “That is a recipe for this war going on essentially forever, with colossal suffering for Ukraine,” says Lieven.\n\n\nAnotol Lieven: U.S. Lawmakers' Framing of Ukraine as Proxy War Is Wonderful for Putin's Propaganda\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\n\nTranscript\nThis is a rush transcript.

This spectacular victory was meant to advance the Russian president's vision of a new manifest destiny, bringing his country closer to re-establishing itself as an imperial power on the global stage. But Putin's gambit failed in grand fashion. Instead of celebrating a victory on May 9 — the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II — the Russian military is trying to reorganize itself after a series of stunning defeats and great losses in both materiel and personnel.\nSpeed was the key element in the Russian plan, but surprisingly strong and effective resistance …",

Any individual donation under $200 can be made anonymously.\nLuckily for Hines, the Club for Growth Action, the group’s super PAC arm, said it plans to spend $1.3 million support him in the primary.  That’s a huge sum for a house race.\nBefore settling in the 13th arrondissement, Hines had searched for a suitable perch.  He announced plans to challenge Rep. Virginia Foxx, a longtime Republican in the west of the state, before redistricting alters those plans.  In April, he and his wife moved to a house in Fuquay-Varinaa town in southern Wake County, the most densely populated part of the district.\nSome Republicans in the dark red county of Johnston, a fast-growing rural community, criticized Hines for, in the words of the leader of a local group, “Coming in, just trying to pick a district he can win.” And Hines’ main adversary, a lawyer named Kelly Daughtry who is the daughter of a former State House majority leader, attacked him as a baggage handler.\nThe Hines campaign, which declined to make him available for an interview but answered a series of detailed questions about his candidacy, notes his upbringing in Charlotte and his time at NC State, which is in Raleigh, just north of the district line.\nDaughtry has spent more than $2.5 million on the race so far, while contributing nearly $3 million of its own money.  She has also caught in heat for his past donations to Democratsincluding Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic Senate nominee, and Josh Stein, the state attorney general.\nSeveral people with access to private polls said Hines appeared to be ahead of Daughtry by a few percentage points, with everyone else trailing far behind.  In North Carolina, if no candidate wins at least 30% of the vote, the first two qualify for a second round.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "HARTFORD, Conn.  — There has always been a certain fluidity in our appreciation of American modernist maverick Milton Avery (1885-1965).  And it’s not just because of the light, airy, boldly simplified, almost abstract paintings of sand, sea and sky that characterized his last decade.  Avery was artistically unaffiliated, never part of any particular group or movement, meaning the general awareness of his work fluctuated greatly.  It is always surprising to realize the range of his styles and subjects, and the opportunity to do so has been too rare.\nNow one of those rare moments has arrived, with much of Avery’s work featured in exhibitions in New York and Hartford, Connecticut. Wadsworth Atheneum Art Museum in Hartford presents “Milton Avery”, a sumptuous study of almost 70 paintings (org…",

Clean and neat, with no frayed edges or faded colors, it flies from a tall pole planted in front of a beautiful two-story house.  There, on 200 acres in southwestern Montana, in a glorious region surrounded by mountains known as Paradise Valley, nature invites and soothes.  It looks like heaven;  it takes a while to see the rot.\nDirectors Scott McGehee and David Siegel don’t dwell on the flag.  Instead, they gently immerse you in a classic Western setting while simultaneously drawing you into a simmering family melodrama about two grappling adult children and their terminally ill father.

          "description": "As demonstrated in movies as diverse as “Monterey Pop,” “Woodstock” and “Summer of Soul,” music festivals can’t help but derive some of their vibe from their sets.  As witnessed by musicians around the world in the documentary “Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story,” directed by Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern, the city’s annual jazz festival in Louisiana has an unrepeatable flavor as it takes place in the cradle American music.\nThe film’s opening montage, featuring familiar famous faces ranging from Tom Jones to Pitbull, is – thankfully – a bit of a fake.  These big names and others play (and in what some might consider an unfortunate feature, Jimmy Buffett plays a lot) but the film is dutifully attentive to the local eclecticism of the festival.\n\n\nExploring the musical atmosphere of New Orleans itself, the film features experts exposing the distinctions between Cajun and Zydeco, for example.  While both are dance music that trades in old melodies, the latter features electric guitar and washboard and comes at you “like a freight train.”\n\n\nEntrepreneur George Wein, founder of the Newport Jazz Festival, helped create Jazz Fest, wisely assuming musician Ellis Marsalis (you may be familiar with the pianist’s work, or that of his sons, including Wynton and Branford) as a guide to New Orleans.  The organizational work was quickly taken over by young music enthusiast Quint Davis, who is still in charge today.\nThe seething history – which also cites the on-site food tents as a jaw-dropping part of the festival’s appeal – turns to tears when Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans in 2005. But the the music came back like a miracleand the film reports that after a two-year postponement due to Covid-19, the event is currently on the comeback trail.\nJazz Fest: A History of New Orleans\nRated PG-13 for sassy little language.

          "description": "Central bankers are hoping their policies will temper economic growth without driving up unemployment or plunging America into a recession – creating what they often call a “soft landing”.\n“I really want this to be the outcome, but I recognize that it won’t be easy to do,” Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview Monday.\nOfficials have clearly recognized that let the economy down gently will be difficult, and some have hinted that they would be willing to inflict economic pain if that was what it took to fight high inflation.\nIf the economy gets to a point where unemployment starts to climb but inflation remains “unacceptably high”, Mr Bostic said, price hikes will be “the threat we have to address”.\nA challenge for policymakers – and even more so for families – is that price increases are surfacing in basic necessities. The cost of food has increased 0.9% in April from the previous month, the 17th consecutive monthly increase, according to Wednesday’s report.\nThe increase was led by dairy products, soft drinks and a 10.3% monthly rise in the cost of eggs as bird flu decimated poultry flocks.  Such inflation tends to particularly affect the poor, who spend more of their budget on necessities such as groceries and gasoline.\nBut while Americans are seeing strong job gains and strong wage growth — although not strong enough to fully counter inflation — many are managing to weather rising costs for now, keeping aggregate demand strong.\n“Consumers seem willing to accept the higher menu prices, especially as inflation runs wide,” George Holm, chief executive of food retailer and restaurant supplier Performance Food Group, said on a call on Wednesday. to the results.  “Nevertheless, it’s something to watch closely over the coming months and quarters.”\nAna Swanson contributed report.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Officials in the United States and Ukraine had long believed that Russia was responsible for the cyberattack on Viasat, but had not formally “attributed” the incident to Russia.  While US officials reached their conclusions long ago, they wanted European nations to take the lead, as the attack had significant repercussions in Europe but not the United States.\nStatements released on Tuesday did not name a particular Russian-sponsored hacking group to have orchestrated the attack, an unusual omission as the United States has regularly revealed information about the specific intelligence services responsible for the attacks, in part to demonstrate their visibility in the Russian government.  .\n“We have and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and relevant government authorities …",

That’s happening now on BeReal, a new platform where people post photos for their friends, with some crucial twists.\nOnce a day, at an unpredictable time, BeReal notifies its users that they have two minutes to post a pair of photos, one from each camera on the phone, taken simultaneously.  The only way to see what other people posted that day is to share yours.

          "description": "Only two witnesses testified during the trial, both for the prosecution.  Ms Tene, 32, who works in the software industry, spent most of the first day at the bar, describing meeting Mr Batali late one night at Towne Stove and Spirits, a bar in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston which has since closed.\nMr. Batali saw her surreptitiously take a picture of him a few seats away from the bar, then invited her to take pictures with him, she said.  At the start of the photoshoot, she testified, as did the forced kisses and groping.\nThe only other witness called was a friend of Ms Tene, Rachel Buckley, 37.  She said Ms Tene sent her a picture of Mr Batali the night they met, along with texts that described him as looking extremely drunk but didn’t.  I don’t mention that he caught her.  Details of Mr Batali’s groping and kissing emerged in subsequent conversations, Ms Buckley said.\nMuch of the evidence at trial came from two years of text messages from Ms Tene, which sometimes showed she was flippant about selling the photos or getting money from Mr Batali.  They revealed incidents in which she lied to opt out of a gym membership and, in an attempt to avoid jury duty, told another court that she was clairvoyant.  Once she was seated on that jury, she broke court rules by researching the defendant’s background and texting a friend that she thought he was guilty.\nThe judge noted these incidents and her disdain for the courts, as well as photos from the night at the bar that showed her smiling after her first meeting with Mr. Batali.  Three minutes later, she took another round of selfies with the chef.\n“His reaction or lack thereof to the alleged assault is telling,” the judge said.\nJust before giving his decision, Judge Stanton also reprimanded Mr Batali.  “His conduct, appearance and demeanor were not befitting a public figure of his stature at the time,” he said.  “It’s a lesson for all those people in public or celebrity positions.”\n\nSource Link",

Europe needs Russian oil one way or another. \nA prediction. \nThese oil tankers will still pick up Russian oil at Russian sea ports. Make a beeline to a European port with their cargo, and while in transit this oil will be sold and resold and resold (all at a premium) to mask where this oil is coming from and to satisfy insurance requirements. In the end this Russian oil will end up in Europe, albeit at a very high cost for the European consumers. \nThe big winners will be Russian oil companies, the Kremlin, and the Greek/Maltese/etc. shipping oligarchs. \n Greek And Malta Shipowners Succeed In Killing EU’s Russian Oil Tanker Ban   \nProposal to ban EU-tankers transporting Russian oil halted by Greek shipowners -- Greeck City Times  \nBrussels back-tracks on shipping ban for Russian crude after Malta, Greece protests -- Malta  \nEU ditches ban on oil tankers that ship Russian crude to third countries, but keeps restrictions on insurers, report says -- Business Insider",
