With his experience from the <em>Napoleonic Wars</em> von Clausewitz knew that totalitarian regimes could end up conducting huge and ruthless military campaigns. Furthermore, he assumed that to win a war it is necessary to mobilize and indoctrinate the inhabitants of an entire nation. Such an endeavour is called <em>total war</em>, a term that actually can be applied to Putin’s war in Ukraine.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2022/10/26/32248\">Read the full story, “War, Greed and Mass Manipulation”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>",

Is it enough to justify the US going to war with Russia over this region? \nSighhh .... so much has now been invested in this conflict by Western governments that I have to say yes. \nBut are European and American citizens as committed as their governments to go to war? \nThe polls say yes to providing aid .... Majority of Americans say U.S. should back Ukraine until Russia withdraws (Axios). But is there support for actually sending US forces to directly engage in war against Russia? To have an actual war with all the damage and destruction that it will cause on both sides? Maybe even resulting in a limited or massive nuclear exchange?\n\nMy gut says no. \n Am I right?",

The ugly performance started right from the beginning, with Fetterman bidding viewers \"good night\" as part of his opening statement.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The New York Times said this was the must watch debate of this election season. \n\nWrong call.\nI feel sorry for Senate candidate John Fetterman.

Daniel Edmund Duggan, 54, now likely faces extradition to the United States. It is an interesting development to occur in an ongoing crackdown on ex-military pilots from Western nations working in China, or on behalf of Chinese clients elsewhere. Namely, last week’s revelations that “at least 30” British former military pilots have been hired by China to provide training and intelligence to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). \nDuggan was arrested last Friday in Orange, New South Wales, by Australian Federal Police. He appeared in court there the same day, according to court records, two police sources, and his lawyer, Reuters reports. A request for bail was reportedly denied, leaving Duggan in jail in nearby Bathurst.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This is what I call sending a very clear message to all former US military pilots/soldiers that working in China is against the law. \n Former U.S. Military Pilot Who Worked In China Faces Extradition To The US After Arrest In Australia Under A Sealed Warrant   \nArrested in Australia, former US military pilot who worked in China now faces extradition -- Reuters  \nFormer US military pilot Daniel Edmund Duggan faces extradition to US after arrest in Australia under sealed warrant -- ABC News Australia  \nFormer US Fighter Pilot Who Worked In China Arrested In Australia -- AFP  \nAustralian police arrest former US fighter pilot who worked in China -- 9News \nFormer US military pilot arrested over China ties – media -- RT",
