José Ricardo Orozco told local Blu Radio. “Four people have died, as of this moment: two women, a man and a minor.”\nMayor Juan Carlos Tamayo said 800 spectators were seated in the sections that collapsed.\nLate Sunday, Tolima health secretary Martha Palacios said in a press conference that 322 people had gone to local public and private hospitals after the collapse seeking treatment. Palacio said the minor who had died was an 18-month-old baby.\nBesides the four dead, another four people were in intensive care and two others recovering from surgery.\nOrozco said he had asked for the traditional “corralejas” to be suspended in Tolima earlier Sunday but this one was held anyway.\nPresident-elect Gustavo Petro urged local officials to ban such events, noting that it was not the first time an incident like this had taken place.\n“I ask mayors not to allow more events involving the death of people or animals,” he said.\nCurrent President Iván Duque on Twitter announced an investigation of the disaster.\n“We lament the terrible tragedy registered in El Espinal, Tolima, during the festivals of San Pedro and San Juan, with the collapse of the stands during a corraleja.

          "description": "In “Accepted,” director Dan Chen takes us into the world of TM Landry, a private school in Louisiana whose videos of African-American students garnering Ivy League college acceptances have gone viral.  But nine months after the filmmakers’ first visit to the school, the New York Times published reports of physical abuse, tampered transcripts and “bigoted” behavior from its founders, Mike and Tracey Landry.  “Accepted” viewers get a front-row seat to experience the shattering impact of the school’s collapse through the stories of four promising high school students: Adia, Alicia, Cathy and Issac.\nAs we watch both the documentary’s subjects — and its director — navigate shocking real-time development, a quiet probing film emerges that pierces the mythos of America’s meritocracy.\n\n\nChen makes the choice to walk at the same measured pace throughout — even after the TM Landry scandal came to light — and forgo the cryptic notation we’re used to hearing when the jig is up.  Likewise, Chen and Daphne Qin Wu’s cinematography seamlessly oscillates between intimate handheld shots and aerial views of western Louisiana landscapes that reflect the eventual loss of access to the Landrys and the ‘school.\n\n\nUltimately, it’s the resilience of the film’s teenage subjects that elevates “Accepted” to new heights.  As they sit for close-ups in front of a swirling blue backdrop, the Georgetown and Stanford sweatshirts are gone, and the hopes they once held.  But in their place is a clear understanding of the misguided pressures on individual minority students to succeed in a society that systematically disadvantages them, and a surprisingly powerful story about peace with imperfection.\nAccepted\nUnclassified.

          "description": "WASHINGTON — With Democrats and reproductive rights advocates clamoring for President Biden to forcefully oppose the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, his health secretary, Xavier Becerra, appeared Tuesday at a lectern to list the steps his department would take to preserve and expand access to abortion.\nThe list, for now anyway, is short. \n“There’s no magic formula,” Mr. Becerra told an early morning press conference, “but if there’s something we can do, we’ll find it and we’ll do it.”\nThe Supreme Court’s decision on Friday eliminating the constitutional right to abortion was not unexpected, but neither the White House nor Mr. Becerra’s agency had immediate policy responses ready.  Administration officials say they are still grappling with the prospect that a mainstream area…",

Just grabbing his stick was a chore, but he did it well enough to score one of the defining goals of a formidable series, the overtime winner in Game 4.\nNothing, Kadri claimed — not physical pain or racial abuse from opposing fans or even moments of his own indiscretion — would stop him from making the final.  So the medical trainers laced up his skates, as if he were a boy, and Kadri helped his teammates win the Cup, earning what he saw as a measure of redemption in the process.\n“I just wanted to be in the thick of it,” Kadri said.  “I didn’t want to be on the outside looking in, so I did everything I could, devoting every …",

As we’ve discussed here repeatedly, however, those allegations and characterizations of the industry are demonstrably false. What we’re dealing with is a lack of refinery capacity. The United States currently has the lowest number of functioning refineries capable of producing gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that we’ve seen since 2016, largely as a result of government policies.

Times: Vice President Harris says Biden 'intends' to run for reelection in 2024 \nVice President Kamala Harris created new uncertainty Wednesday about President Biden's intentions to run for reelection in 2024, pulling back from a definitive statement she had made earlier in the week. \n “The president intends to run and if he does, I will be his ticket mate. We will run together,” Harris told a Times reporter Wednesday as she prepared to depart for California aboard Air Force Two. \nAdvisors had told the reporter that Harris wanted to come to the back of the plane to clarify what she told CNN on Monday. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Harris was asked about speculation that Biden would not run and about her own potential candidacy. \n\"Joe Biden is running for reelection, and I will be his ticket mate,\" Harris told CNN. \"Full stop.\"   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: President Biden will not be running for re-election. Running a campaign from his basement home may have worked during the Covid lock-downs in the 2020 Presidential election. But 2024 is going to be different, and he will need to hit the campaign trail and engage with the public. I do not see him having the energy to do it. On second thought .... forget about 2024. He does not have the energy or focus to do it now.",

While the media is likely to be focused on rumors in the next 24 hours of a possible change in the export strategy of OPEC+, the real focus should be on whether or not the oil cartel is even capable of substantially increasing its production.

          "description": "Zero Hedge: White House Desperate To Make New Oil Deals As Gas Prices Crush Biden \nThere are two schools of thought when it comes to the stagflation crisis:  Those that think inflation in necessities is part of a deliberate agenda of national sabotage, and those that think the whole disaster is a product of pure stupidity.  There is certainly enough evidence to suggest that the establishment benefits to a degree from prices skyrocketing, but they also face massive risks if the crisis unfolds too quickly. \nA stagflation event is like an avalanche, it's going to come rushing down the mountain and there's no slowing it once it gets moving.  Such a crisis can be deliberately created through central bank fiat money printing and hiking interest rates into economic weakness, but are the banks and politicians so foolish as to believe they can control its path of destruction once it starts?     \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: There is no extra oil \"out there\" to get for the short term.
