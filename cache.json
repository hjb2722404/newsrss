He wasn't taking anything, he was taking it back\".\nWhen Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg and declared it the Russian capital \"none of the countries in Europe recognised this territory as belonging to Russia,\" Putin said.\n\"Everyone considered it to be part of Sweden. But from time immemorial, Slavs had lived there alongside Finno-Ugric peoples,\" the Russian leader added.\n\"It is our responsibility also to take back and strengthen,\" Putin said, in an apparent reference to Russia's offensive in Ukraine.\n\"Yes, there have been times in our country's history when we have been forced to retreat, but only to regain our strength and move forward,\" he said.\nThe defeat of Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700-1721) made Russia the leading power in the Baltic Sea and an important player in European affairs.\nBut with ties Russia's ties with the West currently shattered by the Ukraine invasion, Moscow authorities are downplaying Peter's affinity for Europe and focusing on his role in expanding Russian territories.\nMore than three centuries after he sought to bring Russia closer to Europe, Russians on Thursday marked the 350th birthday of tsar Peter the Great with the country deeply isolated over the Ukraine conflict.\nPeter I reigned first as tsar and then as emperor from 1682 until his death in 1725.\nÂ© 2022 AFP",

He was sentenced to life in jail last year.\nIn January 2019, another German national injured eight people when he drove into crowds on New Year's Eve in the western cities of Bottrop and Essen. He was later taken into psychiatric care.\nIn April 2018, a German man crashed his van into people seated outside a restaurant in the city of Muenster, killing five before shooting himself dead. Investigators later said he had mental health problems.\nDuring the football World Cup in Germany in 2006, a German man rammed his car into crowds gathered to watch a match at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, injuring some 20 people. The driver was later committed to a psychiatric hospital.\nÂ© 2022 AFP",

Since March, the Bank of Canada has raised its key rate by 175 basis points â the equivalent of 1.75% â in an effort to contain inflation.  âYou see some households taking a bit of a step back because they have to reposition themselves in the market,â Mercer said.  âThey may need to find a cheaper house, a different location, or time to save more on a down payment.â\nMr Powell added: âWe are on a break â things have changed a lot over the last month.â\nThe real estate board reported 7,283 sales in the Greater Toronto Area in May, down 39% from May 2021 and 9% from the previous month.  The overall average selling price for all property types was C$1.21 million ($962,000), down about 7% from the previous two months.\nBoth trends suggest a more balanced market, which should allow âa bit more bargaining power for people still active in the market,â Mercer said.\nTorontoâs major central neighborhoods, including Rosedale, Lawrence Park and Forest Hill, remain highly competitive as they suffer from a chronic shortage of available housing, said Cailey Heaps, President and CEO of the Heaps Estrin team.  According to the Real Estate Board, a detached house in the city currently averages just under C$2 million ($1.59 million), while a condo averages around C800,000 ($635,000). .\nAdditionally, the luxury market in general continues to perform âexceptionally wellâ, Ms. Heaps said.  âBuyers understand the scarcity of the product they are looking for.â\nIn Port Hope, the average selling price for the 38 homes sold in April and May was 909,000 Canadian ($723,000), up 28% from a year ago, according to Zolo, a classifieds site. real estate.\n\nSource Link",

Rob Walton was president of Walmart from 1992 to 2015. His cousin is Ann Walton, niece of Sam Walton and wife of E.  Stanley Kroenke, owner of the NFLâs Los Angeles Rams, NBAâs Denver Nuggets, NHLâs Colorado Avalanche and Premier Leagueâs Arsenal FC, among other teams.\nPenner is married to Rob Waltonâs daughter, Carrie, and has been president of Walmart since 2015. \nWalton-Pennerâs offer, if approved, would end nearly four decades of Bowlen family ownership.  The Broncos joined the AFL in 1960 and were dismal on the field for their first decade and a half, although they were popular with fans in the Rocky Mountain states.  But after Bowlen bought the club in 1984, the Broncos had 21 winning seasons, 13 division titles, nine conference championship berths and seven Super Bowl appearances.\nHis failing memory, Bowlen retired from team management in 2014, and left several administrators, including Ellis, to oversee the franchise.  The administrators were tasked with deciding which of his children should become the majority owner â or whether the franchise should be sold, if they thought it was in the best interests of the family.\nBeth Bowlen, Bowlenâs second daughter from his first marriage, worked at the club and was interested in becoming the main owner.  But she left the team several years ago.\nBrittany Bowlen, a daughter from Bowlenâs second marriage, was named as a potential replacement.  The seven Bowlen children could not come to an agreement on who should take charge, so the team was put up for auction.\nNow another family, this time with even richer pockets, is likely to take over.  \n\nSource Link",

          "description": "The scrutiny is baffling for Ms Young, 33, who recalled how after the Parkland shooting she brought a leather belt to put in her classroom first aid kit in case she needed a tourniquet for a pupil.\nâItâs literally entrusted to their life,â she said, âbut not entrusted with choosing the program.â\nTeachers in public schools earn an average of about $65,000 per year and were among the most trusted professionals, alongside nurses, doctors, soldiers and scientists.  But as schools closed and the social fabric frayed during the pandemic, trust in teachers has declined.\nFor some, the competing pressures were enough to drive them away.\nâI needed a change,â said Kathy Macken, 62, a math and science teacher in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas, who quit the classroom after 19 to do intensive tutoring with smaller groups of students.\nAfter being out of school earlier in the pandemic, her fifth graders returned this year in dire need.  Even when she tried to help them academically, Ms. Macken said, she spent much of her time trying to keep them calm and focused: Take out a pencil.  Write your homework in your diary.  Please no iPads during story time.\nShe had to cut back on a favorite science project â where students build terrariums to take home â because she didnât have time.\nAnd in the last week of school, a lockdown interrupted an outdoor field day.  Amid the fierce struggle and bouncy house fun, the students were shoved inside.  Ms Macken huddled with her students on the floor of her dark classroom while police investigated a report of a teenager walking down the street with a gun.\n\n\nSource Link",
