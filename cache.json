She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.\nÂ© 2023 AFP",

I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!\"\nThe queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.\nFurther back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.\nÂ© 2023 AFP",

The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.\"\nThe asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Colin Kaepernick targets Kevin McCarthy's crime-ridden California district\nThe rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.\nBy comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.",

All these people were pampered with perks and pats on the back until now and all of a sudden Don, Wolf Blitzer and others are at a point of 'yikes, we're in trouble.'\"",

Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers have been killed, millions have been displaced, large portions of the country are under a brutal Russian occupation and the countryâs infrastructure has been shattered.

President Biden included (link here).\nSo the big question is .... why is the Kremlin permitting Biden, Macron, Scholz, Johnson, Sunak, Trudeau, and other Western leaders to go to Kyiv. If you watch/listen/read Russian news, you would notice immediately that these visits are always being used to reinforce the Kremlin's narrative that this is a war between NATO and Russia. These visits are also being used by the Kremlin to send a message to the non-Western world that the West is a bloc that may threaten you in the future.Â \nSo why did President Biden go?\n\n\nSome are saying it would have been an embarrassment if he did not go, especially since he is next door in Poland.Â  But I think the big reason is that many in the Pentagon and in the West are worried on the state of the war, and Biden had to not only go to Ukraine to reinforce US support of the war, but to tell Zelensky personally that the situation must change on the ground or he will lose this conflict.",
