          "description": "Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.\nOffensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.\nThierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.\n\"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination,\" Murangira said.\n\"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB.\"\n\"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime.\"\nRwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.\nUnder Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.\nAnyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.\nMukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\nIt was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.\nThe 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Former President Donald Trump on Thursday evening claimed he could end the war between Russian and Ukraine in a single day were he still president.\nWriting on his Truth Social platform, the former president wrote an all-caps post declaring that he had an undisclosed plan to make Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come to a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who nearly a year ago launched a completely unprovoked invasion into his country.\n\"IF I WERE PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE WAR WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, BUT EVEN NOW, IF PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR WITHIN 24 HOURS,\" he wrote. \"SUCH A TRAGIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE!!!\"\nEarlier in the day, Trump seemed to take a shot at the Biden administration and other American allies for providing Ukraine with high-powered tanks that the Ukrainians say are needed to drive Russian forces out of their country.\nREAD MORE: Questions raised about freshman Republican's finances after he blows off legally mandated disclosures\n\"FIRST COME THE TANKS, THEN COME THE NUKES,\" Trump said. \"Get this crazy war ended, NOW. So easy to do!\"\nDuring his presidency, Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while he pressured the country to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, who at the time was seen as the toughest general election candidate for Trump to beat in the 2020 election.\nTrump also called Putin a \"genius\" at the start of the invasion, which has now dragged on for several months and has seen multiple Russian military setbacks that have forced its army to retreat from some territories it had seized.",

Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, \"It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age.\"\nIn 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs.

The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.\"\nThe asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Colin Kaepernick targets Kevin McCarthy's crime-ridden California district\nThe rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.\nBy comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.",

Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” \nI question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages.

But with such a high-profile trip at stake, keeping it on the down-low was key. \nHowever, on Wednesday, February 1, a Billings, Montana, resident spotted the balloon around 5:30 p.m. local time, and the next day, a local Montana paper published a report about it. Later that day, late Thursday afternoon, the Pentagon finally confirmed the existence of the balloon. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It was only when the local public media started to report on the balloon that the Pentagon was finally forced to respond. So yes. It does look like this was a situation where some, at least in the Pentagon, wanted this story to not be made public for as long as possible.   \nUpdate: This is a must read post from Bloomberg on the White House's response to this Chinese \"spy\" balloon .... From China to Big Sky: The Balloon That Unnerved the White House (Bloomberg).   \nUpdate #2: Michael Ramirez is brutal (see below).",

In contrast, Israel is allegedly planning to stitch an anti-Iran military coalition to wipe our Iranian nukes. \nCorresponding with Iran’s ferocious warning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began his first visit to France after he returned to power. As speculated, the interaction between the two countries leaders was dominated by the Iranian question. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron denounced Iran’s “headlong race” to build its nuclear program following a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu at the Élysée Palace. This is significant as recent local French media reports have claimed that Israeli outreach to France is part of a plot to stitch an anti-Iran military coalition.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: I am skeptical that such an anti-Iran military coalition would form let alone strike Iran. \nSuch a conflict will result in the immediate closure of the Straits of Hormuz to oil traffic, and a loss of almost a quarter of the world's oil production.\n$300/barrel for oil and the economic shock-waves that such a war would unleash is something that the West is unprepared for.

Instead, it parroted Kremlin lines blaming NATO for provoking the conflict – further fracturing relationships with both Europe and the US.    \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: As long as I can remember a cornerstone of US foreign policy was to make sure that Russia and China never developed close ties, and to exploit the differences between the two. \nThat was then. \nToday I see little if any differences between Russia and China, and a lot of common ground.
