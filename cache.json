With just the sun and a solar panel, a theater can be set up in areas where people struggle to access food and water and make a decent living. But what it truly requires is the courage to not view creativity as a luxury. Sydelle and Rowand, the founders of Sunshine Cinema, a network of mobile movie theaters, are not just entertaining people; they are crossing a bridge.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2023/10/31/35193\">Read the full story, “Can Creativity Change the World?”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>",

RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic predicts payment shocks of up to 48% in 2026, particularly for those with negatively amortizing loans. The report suggests that the Bank of Canada's overnight rate would need to decline significantly to mitigate the payment shock for borrowers.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",
