Gen. Sharon Nesmith, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, said the Eastern European conflict had in “the first instance” caused the army to reconsider how to address air defense, uncrewed systems, deep fires and intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance (ISTAR) capability gaps. \nDuring the three-hour-long Wednesday UK defense committee hearing — which provided the clearest glimpse yet into the war’s impact on UK land strategy — Nesmith told lawmakers that in an attempt to fix the problems, the service has already completed an “internal balance of investment” and continues to look for opportunities to accelerate procurement. \nBut the new approach could be troubled by “two realistic constraints,” Nesmith said: supply chain difficulties and industrial capacity. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Britain's \"Future Soldier Guide\" is here (link here).",

          "description": "New York Times: Did Aliens Land on Earth in 1945? A Defense Bill Seeks Answers. \nFor the casual student of U.F.O. history, the modern idea of life beyond our planet usually dates to 1947, when a top-secret U.S. military balloon crashed in the desert near Roswell, N.M. The wreckage prompted decades of conspiracy theories and gave rise to the idea that Roswell was the site of an alien crash landing. \nNow, thanks to a new congressional spending bill, U.F.O. enthusiasts may look to 1945 as the beginning of that era. \nAn amendment tucked into this year’s $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the Defense Department’s annual operating budget, requires the department to review historical documents related to unidentified aerial phenomena — government lingo for U.F.O.s — dating to 1945. That is the year that, according to one account, a large, avocado-shaped object struck a communication tower in a patch of New Mexico desert now known as the Trinity Site, where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated that July. \nExperts said the bill, which President Biden signed into law in December, could be a game changer for studying unidentified phenomena.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I know governments are very good at keeping secrets.

Nial Bradshaw \nBusiness Insider: Ongoing headaches with F-35 fighter jets are rippling through the rest of the US military's combat aircraft fleet \n* The F-35 program has been plagued by years of delays, cost overruns, and technical glitches. \n* Those problems have prompted the Pentagon to extend the service lives of older combat jets. \n* Extensions keep jets flying but don't guarantee they will meet future needs, a government watchdog says. \nYears of delays, cost overruns, and technical glitches with the F-35 have put the Pentagon in a dilemma. \nIf F-35s aren't fit to fly in sufficient numbers, then older aircraft such as the F-16 must be kept in service to fill the gap. \nIn turn, having to extend the lifespan of older planes consumes money that could be used to acquire new aircraft and results in aging warplanes that may not be capable of fulfilling their missions on the current battlefield. \n\"While service life extension programs are one way to keep current aircraft capable and in operation, they do not guarantee that those aircraft will be available when needed or that they will possess required capabilities to meet future needs,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in a new report on US tactical aircraft.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Problems like this one do not help ....
