While inspecting the building, the agents discovered the tunnel access point, dug right out of the cement floor.\n\"There is no more light at the end of this narco-tunnel,\" US Attorney Randy Grossman said in a the statement. \n\"We will take down every subterranean smuggling route we find to keep illicit drugs from reaching our streets and destroying our families and communities.\"\nCross-border tunnels are frequently used by traffickers who smuggle migrants lured by the \"American dream,\" or drugs, into the United States, the world's largest consumer of South American cocaine. \nAccording to US figures, more than 90 tunnels have been discovered in southern California alone since 1993, including another \"sophisticated\" underground passageway located in March 2020.",

          "description": "The US rock band Eagles of Death Metal were midway through their set when Islamist militants sprayed the Bataclan concert hall in Paris with gunfire, cutting down revelers, frontman Jesse Hughes recounted before a French court on Tuesday. \nGuitar technician Eden Galindo's first thought had been that the sound system was exploding, but Hughes said he knew instantly the venue was under attack.\n\"Being from a desert community in California, I know the sound of gun shots,\" Hughes told the trial of Salah Abdeslam, the only suspected surviving member of the squad that killed 130 people at several locations on November 13, 2015.\n\"I knew that death was coming,\" he said.\nThe assailants burst through the music hall's main entrance and blasted automatic gunfire into the crowd as the band played.\n\"We were thinking that it was going to stop but it just kept coming,\" Galindo told the court. \"After a while they reloaded and a technician told us, 'next time they stop, we run'.\"\nThe band escaped through a side door but their tour manager was killed.\nThe attackers took hostages inside the music hall during an hours-long assault that claimed 90 lives and ended after police shot dead one militant and the two others detonated their suicide vests.\nSurvivors have recounted playing dead for hours, or hiding in cupboards, not knowing if their friends or relatives were still alive. They spoke of the bullets in their bodies and of having to walk over bodies when they finally escaped.\nAbdeslam, 32, is the only one among 20 defendants who is directly accused of murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. He has denied the charges and is standing trial before a panel of judges.\n\nHe told the court in February he had backed out of detonating his explosive vest during the attack.\nSix years on, Hughes said he still got nervous looking into crowds, but that he drew courage from France's ability to move on.\n\"Evil did not win,\" he said. \"You can't kill rock and roll.\"\n(REUTERS)",

A flare up of pain in his knee and existing leg problems have forced the pope to use a wheelchair at times recently.\nOne of seminarians then thanked the seated pope for continuing to carry out his duties despite the pain, telling the 85-year-old Francis that his persistence was an example for them as future priests.\nNoting that they were Mexican because of the flag they were carrying, the pope said: \"Do you know what I need for my leg? A bit of tequila.\"\nAfter much laughter, one of them shouted back: \"If one day we go to Santa Marta, we'll bring you a bottle,\" referring to the guest house where Francis lives in the Vatican.\nOne of the seminarians, Rodrigo Fernández de Castro, posted the exchange, which took place at the general audience last Wednesday, on TikTok.\n(Writing by Philip Pullella; Editing by Alison Williams)",

All of that, to put it mildly, is false.\"\nREAD MORE: Liz Cheney is 'more aggressive than even some Democrats in wanting to go directly after Trump': report\nKhodaryonok noted that the United States shipments of advanced military weapons to Ukraine is being effective in helping the country defend itself against the Russian onslaught, \"despite the resistance of a single senator.\" Kentucky Republican Rand Paul last week blocked Senate consideration of a new U.S. aid package to Ukraine.\n\"A million armed Ukrainian soldiers needs to be viewed as a reality of the very near future,\" Khodaryonok said. \"and we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us frankly will get worse.\"\nWatch the defense analyst's entire take on the Russian war effort below or at this link.\n\nIn an extremely rare moment of candour on Russian state TV today, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok gave a damning assessment of Russia's war in Ukraine and his country's international isolation.

It provides up to $10,000 in burial funds for families who lose children under 17 to gun violence.\nIn the time of sky-high inflation, every governor is trying to find ways to help residents of their state.  Ron DeSantis is giving Florida residents a months-long tax holiday.  Gavin Newsom is giving out free abortions.  And JD Pritzker of Chicago is now subsidizing… funerals.\n“Collins pointed out that ‘firearm violence is a leading cause of death for children and teenagers in Illinois,” and among Black Illinoisans, the rate is disproportionately high.”\nAs homicides in Chicago show no sign of stopping, the demand for funerals is now bigger than the demand for baby formula.  Just like a war-torn country, Chicago has now introduced curfew.  It is safer for the kids to be on the streets of Ukraine or Afghanistan than take a walk in South Side of Chicago.\nWhile Lori Lightfoot fights racism by refusing interviews to white journalists, the city’s black population is getting exterminated by the black drug gangs.  Apparently, Lori believes Tucker Carlson is not only responsible for the Buffalo shooting but also for black gangs indiscriminately spraying bullets on the streets of Chicago.\nThis government only cares about murder that can be blamed on “white supremacy.”   When it comes to black people shooting each other they take a Whoopi approach:  “ya’ll go fight amongst yourselves!”\nInstead of saving lives by asking the President to pay attention, increasing police presence or moving the national guard in, the Chicago authorities decided to go the “compassionate” route of making it cheaper for parents to burry their children who fell victims to incompetent and criminal government.",

In the United States, Britain and Europe, central banks determined to curb inflation are moving to hike interest rates, which risks pushing nations into recession. The developing world faces an emerging debt crisis on top of a growing hunger problem sparked by the war. \nIn the United States, as in much of the rest of the world, gasoline prices surged and stock markets plunged, with the S&P 500 index nearing a bear market, closing the week down 18 percent off its early January peak after a late Friday rally. Large retailers, including Target and Walmart, have reported worse than expected earnings and profits this week, blaming higher costs and excess inventory that piled up in response to supply chain problems.    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Many of these economic dangers were already present and growing before the Russia - Ukraine war.

But this will not end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has expanded in scope and scale beyond the capabilities of the Russian military resources originally allocated. With no diplomatic off-ramp on the horizon, the war risks becoming a permanent state of conflict between Russia and Ukraine — with unknown consequences. \nAs the Ukraine conflict enters its third month, the Kremlin looks likely to achieve its major military objective of securing physical control over the eastern Donbas region. Peripheral territorial acquisition of the strategic southern city of Kherson, as well as a swath of territory connecting Crimea to the Donbas and the border of the Russian Federation, also looks likely.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I agree with Scott Ritter's assessment that Moscow will achieve its military goals in this war, but politically there is no roadmap to end the war. Especially now as the US and NATO continue to arm and train the Ukraine to continue the conflict.\n\nA few weeks into the war this blog predicted that the Russia - Ukraine conflict will continue into 2023. But it will end when Europe, deeply suffering from the economic impact of the conflict, will tell Kyiv to agree to Russia's terms and if not the EU will cut-off political and economic aid. I am still sticking with that prediction.",
