The decree also urged the government to increase the capacity of Ukraine's gas transmission system \"to ensure the import of natural gas and its accumulation in underground gas storage facilities\".",

It was a striking public rebuke that signaled an emerging rift between the military and civilian leadership at a challenging time for Ukraine. The public censure of Zaluzhny came a day after the president's office replaced one of his deputies, the head of special operations forces, who after his firing said he had been blindsided by the dismissal.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). \nThe news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",

But as the number of these attacks escalates, so too does the risk of a deadly incident that will demand a response from the U.S. military, edging it closer to direct confrontation with Iranian-backed groups it suspects are responsible. \n“They are aiming to kill,” a U.S. defense official said. “We have just been lucky.”\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Iraq's Shiite militias are taking credit for these attacks ....

Siluanov attributes this hopeful outlook to full compensation for last year’s decrease and the stabilization of the ruble exchange rate. \nRebound from Economic Contraction \nThe predicted growth in Russia’s economy marks a recovery from the challenging economic climate of 2022 when the nation grappled with a 2 percent economic decline.

I cannot even express in words on how huge of an impact that is having on the economy as a whole. \nBut the big story on the Russia economy that many in the West have not caught up on is the Kremlin's priority to re-industrialize the country.
