Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), calling on him to stop harming military readiness during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.\n\"Your message to [Tuberville] needs to be?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"He needs to lift the holdings,\" said Austin. \"This is a national security issue, a readiness issue.\"\nTuberville, who refused to take Austin's call to discuss the issue this week, is trying to force the Pentagon to drop a policy that pays for servicemembers who need abortions to travel to states where they are legal — although the policy does not pay for elective abortions, per longstanding federal prohibitions on their funding. Austin remains adamant about preserving the policy.\n\"Is that something you're willing to deal with, negotiate?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"Wolf, we have a policy that enables our troops to get access to non-covered reproductive health care, and I think that's an important policy,\" said Austin. \"I think our troops don't get to choose where they're assigned, and certainly we want to make sure that our troops are not disadvantaged because they serve in the military or have the ability to have access to noncovered reproductive health care. One in five of my troops, Wolf, is a woman, and our women are — I mean, they provide tremendous value to this force. I'm proud of them, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.\"\n\"So bottom line is, the Pentagon will continue to pay for travel, for example, for women to go to other states, if necessary, to get an abortion?\" asked Blitzer.\n\"That's our policy,\" said Austin.\nWatch below or click here.\n\n\nLloyd Austin calls on Tommy Tuberville to drop military block\n\nwww.youtube.com",

An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.\nHis attorney said that he had been \"eaten alive.\"\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates \"do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.\" \n“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,\" she said. \nClarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a \"racial justice issue,\" citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail. \nRead the full report at The Washington Post.",

One of the most important is that air power is vital to ensuring ground forces survive and advance. \nBut sustaining power in the air requires having places where jets and helicopters can land, refuel, and rearm. On a modern battlefield, where long-range weapons can reach far behind the frontlines and drones constantly roam overhead, protecting aircraft from the enemy is hard. \nSo Western air forces are increasingly focused on dispersing their operations. One way to do that is by using highway networks to land, refit, and take off before the enemy catches up.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: In a major conflict all major airfields will be a target.

Interestingly, even as NATO members have started to spend more, the Pentagon is still demanding yet higher budgets, abetted by Congress. I thought if NATO spent more, the USA could finally spend less? \nNo matter. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the hyping of what used to be called the “Yellow Peril,” today read “China,” is ensuring record military spending in the USA as yearly Pentagon budgets approach $900 billion. That figure does not include the roughly $120 billion or more in aid already provided to Ukraine in its war with Russia. And since the Biden administration’s commitment to Ukraine remains open-ended, you can add scores of billion more to that sum if the war persists into the fall and winter.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: It was only 5 years ago that the New York Times condemned former President Trump's push to get NATO to spend more money on defense ....

Instead, the campaign risks descending into a stalemate with the potential to burn through lives and equipment without a major shift in momentum. \nAs the likelihood of any large-scale breakthrough by the Ukrainians this year dims, it raises the unsettling prospect for Washington and its allies of a longer war—one that would require a huge new infusion of sophisticated armaments and more training to give Kyiv a chance at victory.\n\n \nRead more .... \nUpdate: West knew Ukraine wasn't ready for counteroffensive – WSJ (RT)\n\n \nWNU Editor: The West has always underestimated Russia, with this counteroffensive being just another example of the West underestimating Russia. \nSighhh ....\nThe hope in the West that Ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day reminds me of something that Hillary Clinton said a decade ago.

More details are now emerging (see Weeb Union and Defense Politics Asia videos above). \nThe big news according to reports from both Russian and Ukrainian sources is that sections of the Ukraine front-lines have collapsed in this region. If true, I predict this will change the focus of the war away from the southern part of the region to this new Russian offensive in the northeast.",
