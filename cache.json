The lawsuit accused Democrats and others of “conspiracy” to link Trump to Russia during and after the 2016 presidential campaign.\n“Basically, the problem with [Trump’s] the complaint is that [Trump] does not attempt to seek compensation for legal harm,” wrote Middlebrooks, who serves the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nAlina Habba, a lawyer for Trump, said…",

The changes had long been pushed by baseball commissioner Rob Manfred in an effort to combat the increase in dead time over four decades and the suffocation of offense in the age of analysis.\n“Over the past few years’ extensive testing, minor league folks and a wide range of fans – from the most loyal to casual observers – have recognized the collective impact of these changes in making the game even better…",

When I arrived, it was just before the platinum jubilee, and I was amazed at the number of people on the street who simply adored her.  And there was a lot of respect.  But there were many, many Americans there,” Hartley said. \n\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Queen ordered the Star Spangled Banner to be thrown outside Buckingham Palace as a way of showing solidarity with Americans.\nQueen Elizabeth II brought together 13 US presidents in office.  She met a US president in 1951 when she traveled to the US and met then-President Harry Truman. \nSince then, she has ridden horses with then-President Ronald Reagan, watched a Baltimore baseball game with former President George HW Bush and danced with former President Gerald Ford.  \nThe first time President Biden met the Queen was as a US Senator in 1982.  \nThe last time I saw her was in Windsor Castle    last year, after the Queen welcomed him and First Lady Jill Biden for tea.\nBiden and the First Lady visited the British Embassy in Washington to sign a book of condolences to the Queen.  He commented on her death at a fundraiser. \n“I had the opportunity to get to know her before she passed away and she was an incredibly decent and gracious woman, and the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth in their grief,” Biden said.  \nThe president said he is likely to attend his next funeral.  All flags at US federal and military installations were ordered to fly with half staff in honor of the Queen. \n    \n\n              \n          Most\n          \n            \n  \nSource Link",

The Sun and our readers loved you. We are proud that you were our queen,” he added. \nThe Daily Express carried the headline ‘Our beloved Queen is dead’, while the Daily Mirror simply wrote ‘Thank you’.\n“Our hearts are broken,” said the Daily Mail headline.  “How do we find the words? Our grief is a hundred different emotions, all difficult to grasp,” her homepage said. \n“As God Save the Queen played on radio and television, as we learned that our beloved monarch had died, a nation’s heart broke,” he added.\nUnsurprisingly, the story filled the inside pages of souvenir edition newspapers, most devoting at least 20 pages to seismic events.\n\nSource Link",

At 45, Meloni, who started her political career in Italy’s post-fascist party, is a political veteran but has almost no government experience. \nAs the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, she has vowed to maintain the course set by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi on support for Ukraine and fiscal discipline.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Italians want real change and a stable government. \nPolls Indicate A Crushing Win For Italy;s Conservative Coalition When Polls Open On September 25   \nItaly's right heads for clear election victory, final polls indicate -- Reuters \nItaly’s fractured left taps young feminist to lift campaign -- AP  \nWhat happens if right-wing Giorgia Meloni wins Italy’s elections? -- Brookings Institute  \nItaly election: who’s running, who will win, and why does it matter? -- The Guardian",

The anti-immigration party is a part of the center-right opposition bloc that is seeking four years at the helm of the biggest Nordic country, proposing to reverse a policy of gradually exiting nuclear energy and warning Andersson’s victory could result in higher taxes. \nStill, Andersson could benefit from being seen as a responsible leader in time of crisis.  The results will trickle in on Sunday night and by Monday morning it should be clear whether opposition parties will get a shot at forming a new government.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It looks like joining NATO is not a ballot issue.

Trump said during the same speech: “Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation.”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU editor: The whole German delegation was launging at Trump, but it was Heiko Maas, was then serving as the country’s foreign minister under then-prime minister Angela Merkel, who led the laughter.
