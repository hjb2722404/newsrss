I'm suggesting they're worth being looked at.\"\nThe White House said last month that reports the United States was discussing launching a national security review of some of Musk's ventures including Twitter were \"not true.\"\nMusk's purchase of Twitter sparked concerns that he could face pressure from countries trying to control online speech.\nThe world's richest man, Musk is CEO of electric carmaker Tesla which counts China as a key market and production base. Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.\nHe also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.\nIan Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. Musk denied his claims.\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Nandita Bose in Washington and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Howard Goller)",

          "description": "OilPrice.com: Price Cap On Russian Oil Comes Into Effect \nThe price cap of $60 per barrel for Russian oil devised by the G7 and supported by the European Union comes into effect today, aiming to curb Russia’s revenues from oil exports while keeping flows into the international market flowing. \nThe cap was agreed upon just before the deadline by the European Union after holdouts including Poland and Estonia refused to agree to the originally proposed range of between $65 and $70 per barrel that came from Washington.  In addition to the price cap, the EU has imposed an embargo on maritime imports of Russian crude, effective today.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I said it before, and I will say it again. This price cap makes no sense. The G-7 are implementing policies that will kill investment in fossil fuels, which means energy shortages in the future and sky-high prices. The $60 oil cap is set so that no Russia oil will be sold to the West for the forseeable future. What this means is countries like China will get a steady supply of oil, at a discount, that will place it in a far more favorable economic and competitive position against the industries of the West and others who have signed onto this price cap. \nUpdate: Some are not paying attention to the West's price cap on Russian oil .... Tankers seen heading to Russia as oil price cap goes into effect on exports (CNBC). More here .... India signals it will continue to buy oil from Russia (AP). \nUpdate #2: See video below: \n \nRussian Oil Price Cap Kicks In \nUkraine updates: G7 price cap on Russian oil kicks in -- DW  \nUkraine war: Oil prices rise as cap on Russian crude kicks in -- BBC \nPrice cap on Russian oil takes effect -- The Hill  \nRussia preparing response to oil price cap – Kremlin -- RT  \nRussian Oil Prices to Change After Introduction of Cap by West, Kremlin Says -- Sputnik",

Natalia Gavrilita: First of all, the attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. These attacks have already caused two nationwide power cuts, one on November 15, 2022, and one a week ago. Today, we heard about new potential attacks, including ones targeting the nearby region of Odesa.\nI think that the greatest threats we face relate to energy security — among other things — because of the supply line via Ukraine as we don't have any high-voltage transmission lines that can be connected to the Romanian grid. We are working on this and hope to have a joint high-voltage transmission line in 2024. Until then, we remain very vulnerable. \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It is going to be a tough winter in Moldova .... Ukraine war: Moldova braces for blackouts (BBC).
