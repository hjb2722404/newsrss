REUTERS/Gleb Garanich\n\n¬†\nThe Telegraph: Prepare for Ukraine's counter-offensive to falter¬†\nNato needs to brace itself for the prospect of Ukraine‚Äôs counteroffensive failing to achieve major success. Indeed, so far, Kyiv has attained only limited gains. But those who expected a lightning breakthrough were always going to be disappointed. This is not German panzers against Polish horse cavalry, nor is it American shock and awe against demoralised Iraqi forces in antiquated tanks with no air cover.¬†\nInstead, we are seeing something closer to an attritional style of warfare, with attacking forces battering against heavily fortified defences. Current operations are at the stage of reconnaissance-in-force along four separate axes of advance, with Ukrainian units probing Russian positions to identify weak spots that can then be softened up with artillery and exploited by armoured reserve forces. Commandos and partisans are said to be working behind enemy lines to create confusion and disrupt command and control centres. Long range strikes are being used to hit headquarters.\n\n¬†\nRead more ....\n\n¬†\nWNU Editor: I expect more of these articles in the coming weeks.",
