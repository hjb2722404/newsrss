We have to be wary,\" he added.\nSting -- real name Gordon Sumner -- shot to fame with The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as \"Roxanne\", \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Walking on the Moon\".\nHe then forged a solo career with classics such as \"Englishman in New York\", \"Fields of Gold\" and \"Shape of My Heart\".\n© 2023 AFP",
