As paradoxical as it may seem, finding cancers earlier could mean as many deaths, at the same time, as without early diagnosis.  Indeed, at least with current treatments, cancers meant to kill are not necessarily cured if caught early.\nAnd there are other risks.  For example, some will test positive, but doctors will be unable to locate the cancer.  Others will be aggressively treated with surgery or chemotherapy for cancers that, if left alone, would not have grown and spread and may even be gone.\nDr. Beer acknowledges that a blood test for cancer “is not without risk or cost, and will not detect all cancers”.\nBut, he said, “I think there’s the promise of real impact.”\nOther experts are worried.\nDr. Barnett Kramer, a member of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine and former director of the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute, worries that testing will go mainstream without ever showing it’s beneficial .  Once that happens, he said, “it’s hard to ring the bell.”\n“Hopefully we’re not halfway to a nightmare,” Dr. Kramer said.\nDamocles syndrome\nWhen Susan Iorio Bell, 73, a nurse who lives in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, saw an ad on Facebook recruiting women her age for a cancer blood test study, she immediately signed up.
