He mentioned this during a ceremony in the Kremlin while accepting new foreign ambassadors. Putin emphasized that the current frozen state of relations is unprofitable for both countries, especially Germany. He highlighted that energy cooperation was disrupted by the sabotage on the Nord Stream pipelines. Russia has accused the United States, Britain, and Ukraine of the pipeline blasts, but they have all denied any involvement. Putin also expressed hope for improved relations between Moscow and London.",

          "description": "The Justice Department announced charges against an Indian man who's accused of directing an assassination plot. \nNikhil \"Nick\" Gupta was charged on Wednesday after an Indian government employee who works on security and intelligence encouraged him to take out a Sikh activist who supports a sovereign state in northern India, the Department of Justice said.\nThe defendant conspired from India to assassinate, right here in New York City, a U.S. citizen of Indian origin who has publicly advocated for the establishment of a sovereign state for Sikhs,\" said Manhattan prosecutor Damian Williams in a statement.\nIt's the second such incident announced in the past week. According to President Joe Biden's administration, investigators foiled another plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States.\nAmong the most startling details in the Justice Department's statement is an alleged revelation from Gupta to an undercover DEA agent that another Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, \"was also the target.\" \nIn fact, he revealed, \"We have so many targets.\"\nALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.\nSikh groups, including some active in the United States and Canada, have vocally advocated for their own state to be parsed out of India. \nThe Diplomat detailed leaked Pakistani documents it says point to an assassination program being orchestrated by India, though the site claimed the leak is attempting to capitalize on India's negative publicity. \nThe Intercept's report last week also cited the same intelligence assessment, saying that the Indian government's \"Research and Analysis Wing\" has been plotting a global assassination plot in several countries in a coordinated effort to target Sikh and Kashmiri activists abroad. \nRead the full court filing by the DOJ here.",

Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said the Biden administration needs to take a “massive retaliation” against Iran to end attacks on U.S. assets.

          "description": "Tom Stevenson, The Guardian: America’s undying empire: why the decline of US power has been greatly exaggerated\n\n \nFor more than a decade, people have been saying that the era of US dominance is coming to an end. But in reality there are still no other global players to rival it \nIn recent years, the idea that the United States is an empire in decline has gained considerable support, some of it from quarters that until very recently would have denied it was ever an empire at all. The New York Times, for instance, has run columns that describe a “remarkably benign” American empire that is “in retreat”, or even at risk of decline and fall. \nYet the shadow American power still casts over the rest of the world is unmistakable. The US has military superiority over all other countries, control of the world’s oceans via critical sea lanes, garrisons on every continent, a network of alliances that covers much of the industrial world, the ability to render individuals to secret prisons in countries from Cuba to Thailand, preponderant influence over the global financial system, about 30% of the world’s wealth and a continental economy not dependent on international trade.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: The US is the major power of the world, and we are still in a uni-polar world. But the trend line is clear. U.S. power is in decline, and we will be living in a multi-polar world in the next few years. I give it another 5 to 10 years.",
