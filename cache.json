The Red Cross deployed at the Acropolis on Thursday to hand out water bottles and help visitors suffering from the heat.\nShelters were set up near the entrance at the start of the week to protect the thousands of sightseers who come to admire the Parthenon from the Acropolis.\nThe authorities have warned about a greater risk of fires, particularly in regions where strong winds are expected.\nGreece suffered major wildfires in 2021 as an exceptionally intense heatwave gripped the country.",

That is an easy question to answer. No one wants to give up their Canadian status. In fact. When the war is finally over I predict another massive influx of Ukrainian refugees to Canada, and almost all of them will be military-aged males who will then be permitted to leave the country and reunite with their family members and loved ones in Canada.",

Though Frank Bruni noted it‚Äôs probably too late, he encouraged Democrats in a New York Times column to talk about Hunter Biden, and suggested Biden should step aside: ‚ÄúIt might be best, for him and for continued Democratic control of the White House, if he let Democrats choose a different 2024 nominee.‚Äù\n\n¬†\nRead more ....\n\n¬†\nWNU Editor: There has been some reporting in the mainstream media on President Biden's cognitive problems as well as possible linkages to his son's business activities when he was Vice President.
