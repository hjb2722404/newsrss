          "description": "By Abdiqani Hassani\nBOSASO, Somalia (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland have extended President Muse Bihi Abdi's current term of office by two years ahead of its expiry in November, the senate chairman said on Saturday.\nThe region's electoral body said last month it had postponed a presidential election due in November to 2023 because of time and financial constraints, among other reasons.\nIt was unclear whether that poll has now been scrapped.\nSaleeban Mahmoud Aden, Somalialand's senate chairman, said 72 members of parliament voted on Saturday to extend Abdi's term by a \"two-year period.\" One MP objected.\nIn August, deadly protests by opposition supporters broke out in the region with demonstrators demanding elections be held in November amid suspicions the president wanted to delay the poll and extend his term.\nThere was no immediate reaction from the opposition to the parliament's extension of the president's term.\nSomaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 but has not gained widespread international recognition for its independence. The region has been mostly peaceful while Somalia has grappled with three decades of civil war.\n(Writing by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Mike Harrison)",

          "description": "Stock market movements over the next few weeks will be key in determining whether we are heading into a short-term or long-term recession, according to forex trader and crypto analyst Alessio Rastani.\nDuring the period October-December 2022, the analyst expects to see the S&P recover.  “If this bounces back or the rally fails and comes back down, then most likely we are entering a long-term recession and something very close to similar to 2008,” Rastani said in the latest Cointelegraph interview. \nAccording to the analyst, such a recession could last until 2024 and would inevitably negatively impact the price of Bitcoin (BTC). \nSpeaking about the latest pound crisis, Rastani believed that its main cause is the rally in the US dollar, which is putting pressure on most other fiat currencies, including the yen and the euro.  However, according to Rastani, the US dollar is approaching the top. \n“Once we see a clear break, a sustained break of the 111.5 and 110 levels on the dollar index, then I think the dollar is at the top. And then I’m looking for a multi-month decline in the dollar at 104 at the 100 level on the dollar index,” he explained. \nCheck complete maintenance on our Youtube channel and don’t forget to subscribe! \n\n\nSource Link",

We make it easy to experience nearby restaurants with the ability to slide down to street level, peek inside and know how crowded it will be,” the blog post offers. for exemple. \n\nSource Link",
