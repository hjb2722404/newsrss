Although the actions of the ex-president are problematic, they are not surprising.  However, shouldn’t the bigger story, and the outrage, be how these documents were able to leave the White House in the first place?\nIn most workplaces, when a disgruntled employee is fired, they are told to collect their belongings under the supervision of a security guard and then escort them out of the building.  The ex-president was ousted by the American people in November 2020, and he was clearly unhappy, denying the election results and promoting plans to prevent the peaceful transition of power.  So how is it that as a private citizen, the ex-president left the White House with boxes of documents belonging to the American people?  What systems or people did we have in place to prevent this from happening?  How have these systems/people let us down?\nInvestigations are underway to assess the impact of the actions of the former president on national security.  However, some impacts are already known.  Our allies will think twice about sharing information with us now that they know we cannot keep confidential documents secure.  Significant damage has been done regardless of what the recently recovered boxes contain.\nI’m not a fan of the former president and I understand the political motivation of the left wing media to focus on the culpability of the former president, but we can’t ignore the national security failure that has happened. product.  This should be the main story.\nRick Bryant\nAmherst\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {   var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];   if (d.getElementById(id)) return;   js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;   js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=833431040023870\";   fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nSource link",

Photograph: Terravivos/Observer Design \nThe Guardian: The super-rich ‘preppers’ planning to save themselves from the apocalypse  \nTech billionaires are buying up luxurious bunkers and hiring military security to survive a societal collapse they helped create, but like everything they do, it has unintended consequences \nAs a humanist who writes about the impact of digital technology on our lives, I am often mistaken for a futurist. The people most interested in hiring me for my opinions about technology are usually less concerned with building tools that help people live better lives in the present than they are in identifying the Next Big Thing through which to dominate them in the future. I don’t usually respond to their inquiries. Why help these guys ruin what’s left of the internet, much less civilisation? \nStill, sometimes a combination of morbid curiosity and cold hard cash is enough to get me on a stage in front of the tech elite, where I try to talk some sense into them about how their businesses are affecting our lives out here in the real world. That’s how I found myself accepting an invitation to address a group mysteriously described as “ultra-wealthy stakeholders”, out in the middle of the desert.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: The super-rich preparing for the end of the world is nothing new.

Still eager for adventure, after army service, Rescorla enlisted in the Northern Rhodesia Police.\nUltimately finding few prospects for advancement in Britain or her few remaining colonies, Rescorla moved to the United States, and joined the US Army in 1963. After graduating from Officers’ Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1964, he was assigned as a platoon leader to Bravo Company of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, Third Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile).

Although he has not chosen his fate, he appears to have, in his last instants of life, embraced it. If he were not falling, he might very well be flying. He appears relaxed, hurtling through the air.

          "description": "WNU Editor: This is what happens when a front line collapses. And while I am sure that Ukraine has lost a lot of soldiers in their Kharkiv counter-attack, they have gained significant territory and they now have the military momentum in this part of the war. \nReaction to this defeat on Russian social media has been predictable and quite a sight to see today. Criticism of President Putin and the Generals who are responsible for the war have been widespread and brutal. I am sure Putin is now feeling the pressure to change his military strategy from a \"special operation\" to something that is more significant. \n\nThe next few days are going to be critical. The Russian Ministry of Defense clearly underestimated this Ukraine counter-offensive, and they are now deploying heavy reinforcements to blunt it. But this takes time, and for now Ukraine will take advantage of their momentum. \nThe big surprise (for me) in this counter-offensive are the actual low number of soldiers that are involved (for now). At the beginning of the Kharkiv counter-offensive Ukraine deployed anywhere from 9,000 - 15,000 soldiers. And on the Russian side it was mostly Donbas militia numbering only a few thousand mixed with a few thousand regular Russian forces to face the Ukrainians. \nOn a thousand mile long front there are always going to be gaps and weaknesses, and in this case the Ukraine military saw an opportunity and they took it.  The big question that needs to be answered is .... can Ukraine keep this territory that they have recaptured? \nI say this because a few months ago Ukraine launched a counter-offensive to the north of Kharkiv and they were very successful. Even reaching the border of Russia, albeit briefly. But within a few weeks they were driven back to their original positions, experiencing heavy casualties. \nWill history repeat itself? We shall see.",
