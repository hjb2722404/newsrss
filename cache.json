By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "One year ago this Saturday, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died after being arrested by Iran’s morality police for wearing her hijab \"improperly\". Her death led to massive anti-regime protests, known by their now-iconic slogan: “Woman, Life, Freedom”. The Observers team has been in regular contact with dozens of women across Iran over the past 12 months. Many of them have told us that it has become the “new normal” for millions of women in Iran to go out in public with their hair uncovered. But with a new law under discussion that would massively increase the penalties for hijab-related offenses, how long will these new freedoms last?",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for a probe into SpaceX.\nThe Air Force works with the company on a variety of missions, such as national security launches, but did not play a role in the use of Starlink in Ukraine when Musk made the decision last September. \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Elon Musk’s refusal to provide Starlink support for Ukraine attack in Crimea raises questions for Pentagon (AP)\n\n \nWNU Editor: This article confirms reports that the Pentagon is now in charge of providing Starlink services to Ukraine ....
