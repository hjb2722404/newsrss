          "description": "For half a century, during the Cold War, every U-S president painted Russia as the dominant threat. America's ideological opposite, a hostile and nuclear-armed power. Ronald Reagan went so far as to call the Soviet Union an Evil Empire.\nSo the events of recent days have been noteworthy. On top of a holdup of U-S aid for Ukraine, former President Trump said he might NOT come to the defense of a NATO ally who hadn't spent enough on defense.\nAnd Tucker Carlson, the erstwhile Fox news host, flew to Moscow to sit down with Vladimir Putin for more than two hours of mostly softball questions. \nAfterward, he pronounced Putin \"impressive\" on stage at the World Government Summit.\nSo what gives? Why the romance between the American right and Russia?\nFor sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.  \nEmail us at considerthis@npr.org.",

But this has been repeatedly debunked; Biden was acting in line with U.S. policy, Shokin was not planning to investigate Burisma, and international observers had accused him of corruption.\nPer the DOJ statement, FBI officials became suspicious in part because Smirnov changed his story and provided different details when questioned at a later date.\nThis comes after a number of other failed Republican allegations against the Bidens, including a series of payments the younger Biden made to his father that turned out just to be repaying loans for a truck.",

The test, the North‚Äôs sixth missile launch event of 2024, added to a provocative run in weapons demonstrations since 2022 that escalated tensions to the highest point in years.\nSome experts say Kim may seek to further dial up pressure in an election year in South Korea and the United States. There are growing concerns in South Korea about a direct military provocation and a possible area of conflict could be the Koreas‚Äô poorly drawn western sea boundary, which has been the site of several bloody skirmishes in past years.\nKim supervised the test launches of the missiles he described as key weapons for his navy. He also accused South Korea of frequently violating what he decried as North Korean territorial waters with its maritime patrols and interdiction of third-party ships. He ordered his navy to strengthen its defense posture in waters near the South Korean border islands of Baekryeong and Yeonpyeong, where a North Korean artillery bombardment killed four people in 2010.\n(AP)",

          "description": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty on Wednesday by a Paris appeals court of illegal campaign financing over his failed 2012 re-election bid, confirming a previous ruling by a lower court.\nHe was sentenced to one-year year prison sentence, half of which is suspended, that can be served through alternative means like wearing an electronic bracelet without going to jail.\n\nSarkozy had been handed a one-year prison sentence in 2021 when first found guilty, though that was suspended while he launched his appeal.\nSarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, remained an influential figure among conservatives and is on friendly terms with President Emmanuel Macron - despite a string of trials and investigations linked to various legal issues surrounding his campaign finances.\nHe has always denied accusations that his party Les Republicains, then known as the UMP, worked with a public relations firm named Bygmalion to hide the true cost of his campaign - marked by lavish show events previously unseen in French politics. \nDuring a hearing, Sarkozy put the blame on some members of his campaign team: \"I didn't choose any supplier, I didn't sign any quotation, any invoice,\" he told the court.\nFrance sets strict limits on campaign spending. Prosecutors allege that the firm invoiced UMP rather than the campaign. They say Sarkozy spent 42.8 million euros on his 2012 campaign, almost double the permitted amount.\n(Reuters)",
