Pregnancy screenings, often used to detect genetic diseases, can now only be carried out by court order, rendering them largely inaccessible, particularly for the most disadvantaged families.",

          "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended his invasion of Ukraine, saying it was a necessary blow against NATO. His remarks came during Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations on May 9 marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, are increasingly describing the fighting in Ukraine as a proxy war between the U.S. and Russia. We speak with the Quincy Institute’s Anatol Lieven, who says the war can only end through negotiations, and aggressive U.S. rhetoric risks prolonging the fighting. “That is a recipe for this war going on essentially forever, with colossal suffering for Ukraine,” says Lieven.\n\n\nAnotol Lieven: U.S. Lawmakers' Framing of Ukraine as Proxy War Is Wonderful for Putin's Propaganda\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\n\nTranscript\nThis is a rush transcript.

This spectacular victory was meant to advance the Russian president's vision of a new manifest destiny, bringing his country closer to re-establishing itself as an imperial power on the global stage. But Putin's gambit failed in grand fashion. Instead of celebrating a victory on May 9 — the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II — the Russian military is trying to reorganize itself after a series of stunning defeats and great losses in both materiel and personnel.\nSpeed was the key element in the Russian plan, but surprisingly strong and effective resistance …",

Thanks to a GM scholarship, she earned a master’s degree in business administration at Stanford.  Since entering the executive ranks, she has held leadership positions in global manufacturing, human resources, product development and supply chain management.\nIn January 2014, she succeeded Daniel F. Akerson as CEO and became the first woman to lead a major automotive company.  Ms Barra guided GM through a scandal stemming from a faulty ignition switch linked to crashes that claimed more than 100 lives.  She then made a series of decisions that showed that the General Motors that had just come out of bankruptcy was not the conservative, weighty giant that consumers and investors had known for a century.\nIn a move that would once have been unthinkable, it decided to withdraw from the European market, a slow-growing, low-margin region where GM had been posting losses for two decades.  GM has sold its European operations to French Peugeot SA, which is now part of Stellantis.  The sale included the Opel division, which had been owned by GM since 1929.\nRemoving loss-making businesses that had been tolerated for years “helped change the mindset,” she said.  “The whole company kind of said, ‘Well, it’s a new day.  “”\nGM, which had long prided itself on developing its own technology, also acquired an automated vehicle startup, Cruise Automation.  In another unprecedented move, GM brought in outside investors, including Honda and T. Rowe Price, to share the costs and risks of spending billions of dollars on self-driving vehicles.\nAlong the way, Ms Barra formed a close partnership with Mr Reuss, a contemporary who had been a candidate for the top job in 2014. He too spent his career at GM and had followed his own father, Lloyd Reuss, a former president of the company.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "This includes using observational data and two sets of computer simulations, one that models the world as it is, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) warmer than it is. was before widespread emissions began in the late 19th century, and a hypothetical world in which global warming never occurred.\nThe conclusion that the likelihood of such an extreme rain event has increased with global warming is consistent with many other studies of individual events and larger trends.  One of the main reasons for this increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.\nThe study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in a given year, although not common, is not a rare event.  The researchers therefore looked at other factors that could have contributed to the high death toll and damage caused by the disaster.\nAmong these, they wrote, were the legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era.  In 1958, for example, Durban City Council passed a measure that forced non-whites to settle in areas that were less desirable and, in many cases, more prone to flooding.\nThe researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements due to rapid urban growth and lack of affordable housing.  Around 22% of Durban’s population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which generally lack proper services and infrastructure.  During the April floods, the study noted that about 4,000 of the 13,500 homes that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most deaths also occurred in these areas.\n“Once again we see how climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people,” said Friederike Otto, founder of World Weather Attribution and a climatologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSource Link",

In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the black hole M87 was 1,500 times more massive than that of the Milky Way;  typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.  “The similarity on such a huge scale is amazing,” said Dr Galison.\nAt Thursday’s press event, Michael Johnson, a member of the team and also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, said, “This is an extraordinary verification of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. “\nEinstein’s Bad Dream\nBlack holes were an undesirable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which attributed gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, in the same way that a mattress sags under a sleeper.\nEinstein’s insight led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which spacetime could quiver, bend, tear, expand, swirl, and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole, an entity with a gravity so strong that not even light could escape.  this.\nEinstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be dotted with black holes.  Many are the remnants of dead stars that have collapsed in on themselves and continued to advance.\nBut there seems to be a black hole at the center of almost every galaxy, including ours, which may be millions or billions of times more massive than our sun.  Astronomers still don’t understand how these supermassive black holes got so big.\nParadoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.  Materials – gas, dust, jagged stars – falling into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.  Some of this material falls into the black hole, but some is thrown out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "HARTFORD, Conn.  — There has always been a certain fluidity in our appreciation of American modernist maverick Milton Avery (1885-1965).  And it’s not just because of the light, airy, boldly simplified, almost abstract paintings of sand, sea and sky that characterized his last decade.  Avery was artistically unaffiliated, never part of any particular group or movement, meaning the general awareness of his work fluctuated greatly.  It is always surprising to realize the range of his styles and subjects, and the opportunity to do so has been too rare.\nNow one of those rare moments has arrived, with much of Avery’s work featured in exhibitions in New York and Hartford, Connecticut.

Clean and neat, with no frayed edges or faded colors, it flies from a tall pole planted in front of a beautiful two-story house.  There, on 200 acres in southwestern Montana, in a glorious region surrounded by mountains known as Paradise Valley, nature invites and soothes.  It looks like heaven;  it takes a while to see the rot.\nDirectors Scott McGehee and David Siegel don’t dwell on the flag.

          "description": "As demonstrated in movies as diverse as “Monterey Pop,” “Woodstock” and “Summer of Soul,” music festivals can’t help but derive some of their vibe from their sets.  As witnessed by musicians around the world in the documentary “Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story,” directed by Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern, the city’s annual jazz festival in Louisiana has an unrepeatable flavor as it takes place in the cradle American music.\nThe film’s opening montage, featuring familiar famous faces ranging from Tom Jones to Pitbull, is – thankfully – a bit of a fake.  These big names and others play (and in what some might consider an unfortunate feature, Jimmy Buffett plays a lot) but the film is dutifully attentive to the local eclecticism of the festival.\n\n\nExploring the musical atmosphere of New Orleans itself, the film features experts exposing the distinctions between Cajun and Zydeco, for example.  While both are dance music that trades in old melodies, the latter features electric guitar and washboard and comes at you “like a freight train.”\n\n\nEntrepreneur George Wein, founder of the Newport Jazz Festival, helped create Jazz Fest, wisely assuming musician Ellis Marsalis (you may be familiar with the pianist’s work, or that of his sons, including Wynton and Branford) as a guide to New Orleans.  The organizational work was quickly taken over by young music enthusiast Quint Davis, who is still in charge today.\nThe seething history – which also cites the on-site food tents as a jaw-dropping part of the festival’s appeal – turns to tears when Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans in 2005. But the the music came back like a miracleand the film reports that after a two-year postponement due to Covid-19, the event is currently on the comeback trail.\nJazz Fest: A History of New Orleans\nRated PG-13 for sassy little language.

          "description": "Central bankers are hoping their policies will temper economic growth without driving up unemployment or plunging America into a recession – creating what they often call a “soft landing”.\n“I really want this to be the outcome, but I recognize that it won’t be easy to do,” Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview Monday.\nOfficials have clearly recognized that let the economy down gently will be difficult, and some have hinted that they would be willing to inflict economic pain if that was what it took to fight high inflation.\nIf the economy gets to a point where unemployment starts to climb but inflation remains “unacceptably high”, Mr Bostic said, price hikes will be “the threat we have to address”.\nA challenge for policymakers – and even more so for families – is that price increases are surfacing in basic necessities. The cost of food has increased 0.9% in April from the previous month, the 17th consecutive monthly increase, according to Wednesday’s report.\nThe increase was led by dairy products, soft drinks and a 10.3% monthly rise in the cost of eggs as bird flu decimated poultry flocks.  Such inflation tends to particularly affect the poor, who spend more of their budget on necessities such as groceries and gasoline.\nBut while Americans are seeing strong job gains and strong wage growth — although not strong enough to fully counter inflation — many are managing to weather rising costs for now, keeping aggregate demand strong.\n“Consumers seem willing to accept the higher menu prices, especially as inflation runs wide,” George Holm, chief executive of food retailer and restaurant supplier Performance Food Group, said on a call on Wednesday. to the results.  “Nevertheless, it’s something to watch closely over the coming months and quarters.”\nAna Swanson contributed report.\n\nSource Link",

On Wednesday, it only said it was “increasing production and deliveries.”  On the call with analysts, Scaringe said he expected pickup trucks to make up about a third of the 25,000 vehicles in the 2022 production forecast.\nIn many ways, Rivian epitomizes the stock market’s sharp downward turn this year.\nIn November, investors crowded into its initial public offering, in which the company raised $13.5 billion, and its shares then soared, briefly giving Rivian a market value almost as large as Ford’s. Motor and General Motors combined.\nBut the stock plunged this year after the company slashed production targets.  The 80% drop in Rivian shares is much steeper than a 31% drop in Tesla shares over the sa…",

To catch it, he had to pay the asking price of $330,000.  \nBut for the veteran of the hit Bravo series – currently in its ninth season – his journey to find that perfect home wasn’t all sunshine and roses. \n“The goal has always been to settle down, put down roots, buy a house,” Lucas told the Post.  “But it’s been difficult to be able to try to do that and for a lot of people my age and my generation, with housing prices the way they are, student loan debt at an all-time high, it’s difficult. .” \nLife on the water helped a little, though.\n“The yachting…",
