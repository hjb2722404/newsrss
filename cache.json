          "description": "At least 11 people have died in storms across the Philippines in the past week, with more heavy rain expected in already sodden regions of the disaster-prone country, authorities said Tuesday.\nBad weather has plagued the country's southern and central islands since the Christmas weekend when downpours triggered flooding and landslides that left 52 people dead and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.\nSince January 3, back-to-back storms have killed 11 people as floodwaters swept through houses, cut roads and swamped crops, the civil defense office said.\nThe state weather forecaster warned Tuesday of \"serious flooding\" in low-lying areas and landslides in the mountains of the central island of Samar.\nHeavy rain has already inundated villages, with water levels reaching three meters (10 feet) in some places.\nSo far, one person was missing and more than 2,200 people had been evacuated from their homes, said Josh Echano, Northern Samar provincial disaster officer.\nThe number of evacuees was expected to rise.\n\"The flood is progressing since yesterday, it's not subsiding,\" Echano said.\n\"This could be fatal. This could be one of the worst (floods).\"\nThe Philippines is ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, and scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "New York Times: Did Aliens Land on Earth in 1945? A Defense Bill Seeks Answers. \nFor the casual student of U.F.O. history, the modern idea of life beyond our planet usually dates to 1947, when a top-secret U.S. military balloon crashed in the desert near Roswell, N.M. The wreckage prompted decades of conspiracy theories and gave rise to the idea that Roswell was the site of an alien crash landing. \nNow, thanks to a new congressional spending bill, U.F.O. enthusiasts may look to 1945 as the beginning of that era. \nAn amendment tucked into this year’s $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the Defense Department’s annual operating budget, requires the department to review historical documents related to unidentified aerial phenomena — government lingo for U.F.O.s — dating to 1945. That is the year that, according to one account, a large, avocado-shaped object struck a communication tower in a patch of New Mexico desert now known as the Trinity Site, where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated that July. \nExperts said the bill, which President Biden signed into law in December, could be a game changer for studying unidentified phenomena.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I know governments are very good at keeping secrets. But keeping the landing on earth by aliens a secret for over 75 years is hard to believe.",

Klare, The Nation: A Pentagon Report on China Fuels a Military Spending Frenzy in the US  \nHow the media is misrepresenting what’s in the document. \n“China to Have 1,500 Nuclear Warheads by 2035: Pentagon.” That was the headline at ABC News on November 29, the day the Department of Defense released the 2022 edition of its annual report on “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” also called the China Military Power report. The Pentagon’s claim that China’s nuclear stockpile would jump from some 400 warheads today to an estimated 1,500 in 2035 was widely reported in the popular media and seized upon by military hawks in Congress to clamor for increased military spending. During the first two weeks of December, the House and Senate authorized a fiscal year 2023 Pentagon budget of $858 billion—some $45 billion more than President Biden requested, with most of the added funds earmarked for weaponry to counter China. \n Read more ....   \nWNU Editor: 2022 will be remembered as the year where the old world geopolitical order was turned upside down. 2023 will be remembered as the year where countries responded to this change by forming alliances and massively expanding their defense budgets.

A turn represented 3.5 days of fighting. \nWhile the carriers were getting blasted by Chinese missiles, the Navy’s nuclear-powered attack submarines and the U.S. Air Force’s heavy bombers not only were dodging Chinese attacks for the most part, they also were managing to sink more than enough Chinese ships to win the war.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It is also estimated the US will lose a quarter of its submarine fleet ....

          "description": "British Challenger 2 battle tank   \nDNYUZ/The Telegraph: The tank’s critics are about to be humiliated in Ukraine \nThe brutal invasion of Ukraine in February last year, and the humiliation of the Russian army on the outskirts of Kyiv was, for some, a turning point in the history of warfare. Armchair generals pointed to the smouldering wrecks of Russian tanks – many destroyed from above – and declared that the age of armour had passed and the long-predicted era of the drone had finally arrived. \nWell, try telling that to the Ukrainians. Now, as a new year dawns and a renewed cycle of offensives and counter-offensives seems inevitable, they are desperate for the West to give them the most advanced tanks possible, seeing them as vital for the next phase of the war. They are right to do so. Far from the age of the tank being over, a new one is just beginning. As such, Downing Street is entirely right to be considering supplying Ukraine with Challenger 2 models that could deliver the knockout blow against Vladimir Putin’s forces.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I am sure these tanks will help Ukraine in this war. But the Russians also have the means to destroy them like the Ukrainians do, and these tanks will have a lot of problems over long supply chains to receive the fuel that they need to conduct operations. \nUkraine has been experiencing fuel and diesel shortages since the start of the war. Supporting a tank force that will make a difference on the battlefield will only make these shortages worse.",
