          "description": "Rwandan authorities on Saturday said they had arrested six people for allegedly hurling insults at a woman who made history as one of the first female referees chosen for the men's World Cup.\nOffensive slurs were repeatedly chanted at Salima Mukansanga by fans from Kiyovu Soccer Club as she refereed their 0-0 draw against Gasogi United on January 20 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.\nThierry Murangira, spokesman for the Rwanda Investigative Bureau (RIB), told AFP that three women and three men were arrested on Thursday.\n\"Those arrested are being investigated for hurling insults in public and for discrimination,\" Murangira said.\n\"They are suspected to have committed these crimes during a football match between Kiyovu FC and Gasogi United and they are now in the custody of RIB.\"\n\"Investigations will continue as we prepare their dossier to be submitted to the prosecutors, while we continue to search for others who were involved in this crime.\"\nRwanda's soccer federation this week launched an investigation into the matter, vowing to name and shame those responsible.\nUnder Rwanda's Penal Code, public insults carry a penalty of two to six months in jail and a fine ranging from $500 to $3000.\nAnyone found guilty of discrimination can be jailed for five to seven years.\nMukansanga was among three women in the list of 36 referees selected by FIFA to referee in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\nIt was the first time women had been called up for the men's event, though Mukansanga did not end up officiating a match.\nThe 34-year-old made history last year by becoming the first woman to referee at the Africa Cup of Nations. She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.\n© 2023 AFP",

Originally set at seven minutes to midnight, the farthest it has been from midnight was 17 minutes — in 1991, right after the end of the Cold War. Some mistakenly believe the clock is a gauge to register international power struggles, but according to scientists, \"It is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age.\"\nIn 1953, the previous closest point to midnight before 2020, scientists pushed the time forward after the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs.

The asteroid will then complete one orbit every 425 days.\"\nThe asteroid will pass through the arc occupied by the world's telecommunications satellites, which orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, but the chances of it hitting one are believed to be remote.\nIN OTHER NEWS: Colin Kaepernick targets Kevin McCarthy's crime-ridden California district\nThe rock is about 11.5 feet to 28 feet across and would likely disintegrate high in the atmosphere, producing a spectacular fireball, if it was on a direct path toward the earth.\nBy comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor that entered Earth's atmosphere over southern Russia in 2013 was about 66 feet across and produced a shockwave that shattered windows, and the massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was more than 7 miles across.",

Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” \nI question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages.

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne   \nDouglas Macgregor, American Conservative: This Time It’s Different \nNeither we nor our allies are prepared to fight all-out war with Russia, regionally or globally. \nUntil it decided to confront Moscow with an existential military threat in Ukraine, Washington confined the use of American military power to conflicts that Americans could afford to lose, wars with weak opponents in the developing world from Saigon to Baghdad that did not present an existential threat to U.S. forces or American territory. This time—a proxy war with Russia—is different. \nContrary to early Beltway hopes and expectations, Russia neither collapsed internally nor capitulated to the collective West’s demands for regime change in Moscow. Washington underestimated Russia’s societal cohesion, its latent military potential, and its relative immunity to Western economic sanctions. \nAs a result, Washington’s proxy war against Russia is failing. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was unusually candid about the situation in Ukraine when he told the allies in Germany at Ramstein Air Base on January 20, “We have a window of opportunity here, between now and the spring,” admitting, “That’s not a long time.”    \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Douglas Macgregor has been accurate in his analysis on the war since the beginning.

Already following a year in which North Korea tested more missiles of all ranges than in any previous 12-month period, Kim announced that Pyongyang would start “mass-production of tactical nuclear weapons,” leading to “an exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal.” And few would be surprised if he decided to conduct a seventh nuclear weapons test this year.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: I am sure South Korea, if it wants, can build nuclear weapns very quickly.
