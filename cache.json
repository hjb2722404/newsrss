I’m not criticizing him for it. Our nation is better off with him away on his medical retreats—I mean vacations,\" said Breanna Morello.\n\n\"41 per cent of Americans have picked up a side job while Joe Biden spent half of August on vacation,\" said Lance Gooden.",

Gazprom’s production is not falling, but it is even rising, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. \n\"Gazprom’s production is not falling, or you will scare everyone now, but [it is] only rising,\" he said at a meeting devoted to Kamchatka’s social and economic development after Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that as a program for Kamchatka’s gasification and field development was adopted 15 years ago Novatek started production, but the resource base was not confirmed, which caused a decline in production over the past years. The replacement of gas with fuel oil is out of the question in a region with high tourist potential, he added.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Some differ with Putin's Gazprom assessment .... Russian state-energy giant Gazprom saw its natural-gas production in July slump to its lowest level since 2008 (Insider). \nAs to what is my take. \nGazprom's export of natural gas has declined this summer because of pipeline and turbine issues, and with Nord Stream 1 now shut down indefinitely, its production will fall even more. But I think this is temporary. There is now a push to export natural gas to energy hungry countries in Asia ....

REUTERS   \nZero Hedge: Sweden, Austria Start Bailing Out Energy Companies Triggering Europe's \"Minsky Moment\" \nLast weekend, Credit Suisse repo guru published what may have been the most insightful snippet of the entire European energy crisis (to date) when he extended the infamous \"Minsky Moment\" framework to Europe, and specifically Germany, which he said \"can’t cover its payments without Russian gas and the government is asking citizens to conserve energy to leave more for industry.\" He then elaborated that \"Minsky moments are triggered by excessive financial leverage, and in the context of supply chains, leverage means excessive operating leverage: in Germany, $2 trillion of value added depends on $20 billion of gas from Russia… …that’s 100-times leverage – much more than Lehman’s.\" (Zoltan's entire note is a must read for everyone with a passing interest in what comes next). \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: More signs that Europe is losing this economic war against Russia ....

More international support is vital, but how much new cash could be raised domestically? \nAs the war against Russia enters its seventh month, Ukraine is stuck between a financial rock and a hard place as it seeks to stay afloat while fighting off Moscow's invading forces. \nTax revenues have plummeted due to an economy in free fall while military spending has skyrocketed, leaving the government facing a budget shortfall of $5 billion (€5.02 billion) per month. \nTo make up for the lack of cash, the country's central bank has effectively been printing money — buying government bonds to the tune of $7.7 billion over the past six months.
