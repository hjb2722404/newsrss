At first, around the shores, the continental shelf is little more than an extension of the adjoining landmass. But then one reaches the edge of the abyss and, with the sudden drop that follows, everything changes. Remarkably, in view of what is known about the rest of the planet, and even outer space, most of the ocean floor remains largely a mystery. The scientific consensus is that only 5% of the deep sea has been explored in any detail.

          "description": "The French government issued a decree Tuesday banning the term \"steak\" on the label of vegetarian products, saying it was reserved for meat alone.\nOther terms that can no longer be used for meat-free products include \"escalope\", \"ham\", \"filet\" and \"prime rib\", according to the decree.\nThe ruling is a response to a long-standing complaint by the meat industry that terms like \"vegetarian ham\" or \"vegan sausage\" were confusing for consumers.\nIt is based on a 2020 law whose application was temporarily suspended by the State Council in June 2022 after a complaint from Proteines France, a consortium of French companies selling plant-based food.\nAccording to the revised decree published Tuesday, some products containing a small amount of plant-based content can continue to use meaty names, such as merguez sausage, bacon or cordon bleu.\nProducers elsewhere in the European Union can continue to sell vegetarian food with meat names in France.\nProteines France has been arguing that the French law is at odds with EU food rules.\nIndividuals breaking the labelling law can be fined up to 1,500 euros ($1,630), rising to 7,500 euros for companies.\nBut producers have one year to sell their existing stock before any penalties are applied, the decree said.\n© 2024 AFP",

          "description": "Glenn Kirschner appeared on MSNBC's Ayman, where he was asked about former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who was recently re-arrested after being let out of custody.\nSpecifically, the host asked Kirschner whether it appeared as the GOP leaders such as Jordan and James Comer ignored valid warnings about the informant's information.\nALSO READ: Republican congressman violates federal law with botched cryptocurrency disclosures\n\"Were the Republicans in league or incompetent?\" Kirschner asked. \"It's one or the other. And here's the thing. There's a lot to dislike, sort of every link of the chain here. First of all, the FBI writes down lots of things that human informants and confidential informants say. That doesn't mean it is necessarily true. Yes, they record it in a form, 1023, but they write it down. It doesn't mean it's verified, it doesn't mean it's accurate, it doesn't mean it's reliable. Once they receive it, they have to go about the hard work of corroborating it, or debunking it. And it sounds like the FBI never corroborated, and indeed, ultimately debunked this disinformation.\"\nHe continued:\n\"So why this debunked Russian disinformation would then be handed off to Republican members of Congress to be used as the basis to impeach an American president is mystifying, Ayman. And look, let's use Jim Jordan as an example. You played a clip of him appearing to double down, even though he now knows it's Russian disinformation, and Smirnov has been indicted for lying to the FBI about the Bidens. Jim Jordan is a serial abuser of his position and his authority. This is the guy who refused to comply with a lawfully issued congressional subpoena because had he complied and testified he might have incriminated Donald Trump.\"\nWatch the video below or click the link.",
