The series is open to both members within the YCYW Education Network, as well as online participants across the globe, providing a platform for all parents and students to engage in cutting-edge issues of the modern age. By inviting outstanding leaders across diverse fields to share their insights and stories through presentations, interviews, and roundtable discussions, the programme aims to enlighten the community and illuminate the way to a brighter future.Â \r \r YCYW has always been committed to aligning with science and technology, and is renowned for its progressive use of education technology to break down silos and foster effective learning. In keeping with YCYWâs dedication to science and technology, the second session of the âPlanet Leadership Seriesâ is centred on the topic âThe future is at your doorstep: Human vs Technologyâ. It examined the opportunities and challenges presented by technology, as well as how students can successfully navigate a future of accelerating technological change.\r \r \r \r The event kickstarted with an address by Dr Betty Chan Po-king, CEO and School Supervisor of YCYW Education Network. In an era of rapid technological transformation, Chan emphasised the importance of education in nurturing curious minds and caring hearts to provide direction for societal development. âWe see ourselves existing not within a bubble, but as active stewards of our planet. It falls on us to care for the environment and for others, and it is this spirit that animates our educational thrust,â she asserts. As such, she views the marriage of technology and education as an exciting proposition that dovetails with YCYWâs mission of aligning with science and technology.\r \r As the keynote speaker, Mr Vic Lee, founder of Catalyst Education Lab and co-founder of Tencent, shared his insights on the relationship between humans and technology.

There have been allegations of corruption by foes of President Vladimir Putin that cash was siphoned off, leaving the military unable to buy necessary equipment. \nThe Daily Beast reported Thursday that one soldier's mother was on a tapped call that was shared by Ukraine's Security Service (SB). \"How much do you need?\" the mom asked. \"And what kind of equipment?\"\nShe later asked, \"And you have to buy that with your own money?\" \nThe frustration isn't unheard of, when it was discovered that Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan were buying their own body armor in 2004.

We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.\"\nFinland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia, has traditionally stayed away from NATO membership in the interest of maintaining a diplomatic balance between Russia and other Western European nations.\nREAD MORE: Cheers as Trump DC hotel sign taken down: 'Good riddance to a sinkhole of corruption'\nFinancial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon comments that the decision by Finland to apply for NATO membership now can only be seen as \"yet more blowback from Moscowâs war in Ukraine,\" which has also resulted in an unprecedented number of crippling sanctions that internal Kremlin forecasts show could led to a 12 percent contraction of gross domestic product this year alone.\nNow that Finland is applying for NATO membership, the next question will be whether Sweden, which has also traditionally tried to remain militarily neutral between Russia and Western Europe, will follow suit.",

Felix HÃ¶rhager/dpa\nLufthansa's boss apologized on Wednesday for an incident in which a group of Jews was removed from a plane because of a dispute with a few individuals who failed to follow rules about wearing masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.\nThe apology relates to a May 4 incident. After a flight from New York to Frankfurt, during which some individuals did not comply with rules regarding masks, the airline had all members of a tour group of Orthodox Jews removed from a continuing flight to Budapest.\nThe airline had already issued a statement of apology on Tuesday, noting it was unfortunate that the entire group was removed when the dispute had only been with certain individuals.\n\"We apologize to all guests, not just because they couldn't travel further, but because their personal feelings were hurt,\" read the Tuesday statement.\nLufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr on Wednesday apologized to a representative of the Jewish community in Berlin, according to Lufthansa. That followed a company meeting in which Spohr told employees that such incidents cannot happen.\n\"Anti-Semitism has no place at Lufthansa. The incidences of last Wednesday should never have happened and have to be cleared up comprehensively.\"",

Or just borrowed.\nLike âBig Lieâ or âDonât Say Gayâ over the past two years, the phrase âultra-MAGAâ â along with descriptors like âextreme MAGAâ and more â has gone straight from the lips of Democrats to media ears and pens.

Thanks to a GM scholarship, she earned a masterâs degree in business administration at Stanford.  Since entering the executive ranks, she has held leadership positions in global manufacturing, human resources, product development and supply chain management.\nIn January 2014, she succeeded Daniel F. Akerson as CEO and became the first woman to lead a major automotive company.  Ms Barra guided GM through a scandal stemming from a faulty ignition switch linked to crashes that claimed more than 100 lives.  She then made a series of decisions that showed that the General Motors that had just come out of bankruptcy was not the conservative, weighty giant that consumers and investors had known for a century.\nIn a move that would once have been unthinkable, it decided to withdraw from the European market, a slow-growing, low-margin region where GM had been posting losses for two decades.  GM has sold its European operations to French Peugeot SA, which is now part of Stellantis.  The sale included the Opel division, which had been owned by GM since 1929.\nRemoving loss-making businesses that had been tolerated for years âhelped change the mindset,â she said.  âThe whole company kind of said, âWell, itâs a new day.  ââ\nGM, which had long prided itself on developing its own technology, also acquired an automated vehicle startup, Cruise Automation.  In another unprecedented move, GM brought in outside investors, including Honda and T. Rowe Price, to share the costs and risks of spending billions of dollars on self-driving vehicles.\nAlong the way, Ms Barra formed a close partnership with Mr Reuss, a contemporary who had been a candidate for the top job in 2014. He too spent his career at GM and had followed his own father, Lloyd Reuss, a former president of the company.\n\nSource Link",

One of the main reasons for this increase is that as the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture.\nThe study noted that from a meteorological perspective, a storm that has a 1 in 20 chance of occurring in a given year, although not common, is not a rare event.  The researchers therefore looked at other factors that could have contributed to the high death toll and damage caused by the disaster.\nAmong these, they wrote, were the legacies of policies instituted during the apartheid era.  In 1958, for example, Durban City Council passed a measure that forced non-whites to settle in areas that were less desirable and, in many cases, more prone to flooding.\nThe researchers also cited the rise of makeshift settlements due to rapid urban growth and lack of affordable housing.  Around 22% of Durbanâs population, or 800,000 people, live in such settlements, which generally lack proper services and infrastructure.  During the April floods, the study noted that about 4,000 of the 13,500 homes that were damaged or destroyed were along riverbanks in these types of settlements, and most deaths also occurred in these areas.\nâOnce again we see how climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people,â said Friederike Otto, founder of World Weather Attribution and a climatologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Dr Ãzel said the new imageâs similarity to that of 2019 demonstrated that the previous image was no coincidence.  In an interview, Peter Galison, a physicist and historian at Harvard and a member of the collaboration, noted that the black hole M87 was 1,500 times more massive than that of the Milky Way;  typically in physics or astronomy, when something increases by a factor of 10 or more, everything changes.  âThe similarity on such a huge scale is amazing,â said Dr Galison.\nAt Thursdayâs press event, Michael Johnson, a member of the team and also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, said, âThis is an extraordinary verification of Einsteinâs theory of general relativity. â\nEinsteinâs Bad Dream\nBlack holes were an undesirable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which attributed gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, in the same way that a mattress sags under a sleeper.\nEinsteinâs insight led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which spacetime could quiver, bend, tear, expand, swirl, and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole, an entity with a gravity so strong that not even light could escape.  this.\nEinstein disapproved of this idea, but the universe is now known to be dotted with black holes.  Many are the remnants of dead stars that have collapsed in on themselves and continued to advance.\nBut there seems to be a black hole at the center of almost every galaxy, including ours, which may be millions or billions of times more massive than our sun.  Astronomers still donât understand how these supermassive black holes got so big.\nParadoxically, despite their ability to swallow light, black holes are the most luminous objects in the universe.  Materials â gas, dust, jagged stars â falling into a black hole are heated to millions of degrees in a dense maelstrom of electromagnetic fields.  Some of this material falls into the black hole, but some is thrown out by enormous pressures and magnetic fields.\n\nSource Link",

Any individual donation under $200 can be made anonymously.\nLuckily for Hines, the Club for Growth Action, the groupâs super PAC arm, said it plans to spend $1.3 million support him in the primary.  Thatâs a huge sum for a house race.\nBefore settling in the 13th arrondissement, Hines had searched for a suitable perch.  He announced plans to challenge Rep. Virginia Foxx, a longtime Republican in the west of the state, before redistricting alters those plans.  In April, he and his wife moved to a house in Fuquay-Varinaa town in southern Wake County, the most densely populated part of the district.\nSome Republicans in the dark red county of Johnston, a fast-growing rural community, criticized Hines for, in the words of the leader of a local group, âComing in, just trying to pick a district he can win.â And Hinesâ main adversary, a lawyer named Kelly Daughtry who is the daughter of a former State House majority leader, attacked him as a baggage handler.\nThe Hines campaign, which declined to make him available for an interview but answered a series of detailed questions about his candidacy, notes his upbringing in Charlotte and his time at NC State, which is in Raleigh, just north of the district line.\nDaughtry has spent more than $2.5 million on the race so far, while contributing nearly $3 million of its own money.  She has also caught in heat for his past donations to Democratsincluding Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic Senate nominee, and Josh Stein, the state attorney general.\nSeveral people with access to private polls said Hines appeared to be ahead of Daughtry by a few percentage points, with everyone else trailing far behind.

          "description": "HARTFORD, Conn.  â There has always been a certain fluidity in our appreciation of American modernist maverick Milton Avery (1885-1965).  And itâs not just because of the light, airy, boldly simplified, almost abstract paintings of sand, sea and sky that characterized his last decade.  Avery was artistically unaffiliated, never part of any particular group or movement, meaning the general awareness of his work fluctuated greatly.  It is always surprising to realize the range of his styles and subjects, and the opportunity to do so has been too rare.\nNow one of those rare moments has arrived, with much of Averyâs work featured in exhibitions in New York and Hartford, Connecticut. Wadsworth Atheneum Art Museum in Hartford presents âMilton Averyâ, a sumptuous study of almost 70 paintings (orgâ¦",

It looks like heaven;  it takes a while to see the rot.\nDirectors Scott McGehee and David Siegel donât dwell on the flag.

As witnessed by musicians around the world in the documentary âJazz Fest: A New Orleans Story,â directed by Frank Marshall and Ryan Suffern, the cityâs annual jazz festival in Louisiana has an unrepeatable flavor as it takes place in the cradle American music.\nThe filmâs opening montage, featuring familiar famous faces ranging from Tom Jones to Pitbull, is â thankfully â a bit of a fake.  These big names and others play (and in what some might consider an unfortunate feature, Jimmy Buffett plays a lot) but the film is dutifully attentive to the local eclecticism of the festival.\n\n\nExploring the musical atmosphere of New Orleans itself, the film features experts exposing the distinctions between Cajun and Zydeco, for example.  While both are dance music that trades in old melodies, the latter features electric guitar and washboard and comes at you âlike a freight train.â\n\n\nEntrepreneur George Wein, founder of the Newport Jazz Festival, helped create Jazz Fest, wisely assuming musician Ellis Marsalis (you may be familiar with the pianistâs work, or that of his sons, including Wynton and Branford) as a guide to New Orleans.  The organizational work was quickly taken over by young music enthusiast Quint Davis, who is still in charge today.\nThe seething history â which also cites the on-site food tents as a jaw-dropping part of the festivalâs appeal â turns to tears when Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans in 2005. But the the music came back like a miracleand the film reports that after a two-year postponement due to Covid-19, the event is currently on the comeback trail.\nJazz Fest: A History of New Orleans\nRated PG-13 for sassy little language.

The cost of food has increased 0.9% in April from the previous month, the 17th consecutive monthly increase, according to Wednesdayâs report.\nThe increase was led by dairy products, soft drinks and a 10.3% monthly rise in the cost of eggs as bird flu decimated poultry flocks.  Such inflation tends to particularly affect the poor, who spend more of their budget on necessities such as groceries and gasoline.\nBut while Americans are seeing strong job gains and strong wage growth â although not strong enough to fully counter inflation â many are managing to weather rising costs for now, keeping aggregate demand strong.\nâConsumers seem willing to accept the higher menu prices, especially as inflation runs wide,â George Holm, chief executive of food retailer and restaurant supplier Performance Food Group, said on a call on Wednesday. to the results.  âNevertheless, itâs something to watch closely over the coming months and quarters.â\nAna Swanson contributed report.\n\nSource Link",
