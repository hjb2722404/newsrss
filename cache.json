Since March, the Bank of Canada has raised its key rate by 175 basis points — the equivalent of 1.75% — in an effort to contain inflation.  “You see some households taking a bit of a step back because they have to reposition themselves in the market,” Mercer said.  “They may need to find a cheaper house, a different location, or time to save more on a down payment.”\nMr Powell added: “We are on a break – things have changed a lot over the last month.”\nThe real estate board reported 7,283 sales in the Greater Toronto Area in May, down 39% from May 2021 and 9% from the previous month.  The overall average selling price for all property types was C$1.21 million ($962,000), down about 7% from the previous two months.\nBoth trends suggest a more balanced market, which should allow “a bit more bargaining power for people still active in the market,” Mercer said.\nToronto’s major central neighborhoods, including Rosedale, Lawrence Park and Forest Hill, remain highly competitive as they suffer from a chronic shortage of available housing, said Cailey Heaps, President and CEO of the Heaps Estrin team.  According to the Real Estate Board, a detached house in the city currently averages just under C$2 million ($1.59 million), while a condo averages around C800,000 ($635,000). .\nAdditionally, the luxury market in general continues to perform “exceptionally well”, Ms. Heaps said.  “Buyers understand the scarcity of the product they are looking for.”\nIn Port Hope, the average selling price for the 38 homes sold in April and May was 909,000 Canadian ($723,000), up 28% from a year ago, according to Zolo, a classifieds site. real estate.\n\nSource Link",

          "description": "Other than “commanding a three-game-to-zero lead,” there’s perhaps no more overworked phrase in playoff hockey than “pivotal play 5.”\nAfter all, every postseason game, especially when teams make it to the Eastern Conference Finals like the Rangers and Tampa Bay Lightning, is crucial.\nThat was certainly true Tuesday when the Rangers and Lightning played Game 4 in Tampa, Fla.  The Rangers, up two games to one, needed a win to head home with a chance of securing a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals against Colorado.  Avalanche, which swept the Edmonton Oilers on Monday, and avoided another grueling seven-game series as they did against the Penguins in the first round and the Hurricanes in the conference semifinals.\nThe Lightning wanted to build on their third game, victory from behind, and conti…",

          "description": "This restriction is unlikely to limit Rob Walton, Greg Penner and their families.  Walton, 77, is the oldest child of Walmart co-founder Helen and Sam Walton.  Rob Walton was president of Walmart from 1992 to 2015. His cousin is Ann Walton, niece of Sam Walton and wife of E.  Stanley Kroenke, owner of the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, NBA’s Denver Nuggets, NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and Premier League’s Arsenal FC, among other teams.\nPenner is married to Rob Walton’s daughter, Carrie, and has been president of Walmart since 2015. \nWalton-Penner’s offer, if approved, would end nearly four decades of Bowlen family ownership.  The Broncos joined the AFL in 1960 and were dismal on the field for their first decade and a half, although they were popular with fans in the Rocky Mountain states.  But after Bowlen bought the club in 1984, the Broncos had 21 winning seasons, 13 division titles, nine conference championship berths and seven Super Bowl appearances.\nHis failing memory, Bowlen retired from team management in 2014, and left several administrators, including Ellis, to oversee the franchise.  The administrators were tasked with deciding which of his children should become the majority owner – or whether the franchise should be sold, if they thought it was in the best interests of the family.\nBeth Bowlen, Bowlen’s second daughter from his first marriage, worked at the club and was interested in becoming the main owner.  But she left the team several years ago.\nBrittany Bowlen, a daughter from Bowlen’s second marriage, was named as a potential replacement.  The seven Bowlen children could not come to an agreement on who should take charge, so the team was put up for auction.\nNow another family, this time with even richer pockets, is likely to take over.  \n\nSource Link",

          "description": "The scrutiny is baffling for Ms Young, 33, who recalled how after the Parkland shooting she brought a leather belt to put in her classroom first aid kit in case she needed a tourniquet for a pupil.\n“It’s literally entrusted to their life,” she said, “but not entrusted with choosing the program.”\nTeachers in public schools earn an average of about $65,000 per year and were among the most trusted professionals, alongside nurses, doctors, soldiers and scientists.  But as schools closed and the social fabric frayed during the pandemic, trust in teachers has declined.\nFor some, the competing pressures were enough to drive them away.\n“I needed a change,” said Kathy Macken, 62, a math and science teacher in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas, who quit the classroom after 19 to do intensive tutoring with smaller groups of students.\nAfter being out of school earlier in the pandemic, her fifth graders returned this year in dire need.  Even when she tried to help them academically, Ms. Macken said, she spent much of her time trying to keep them calm and focused: Take out a pencil.  Write your homework in your diary.  Please no iPads during story time.\nShe had to cut back on a favorite science project — where students build terrariums to take home — because she didn’t have time.\nAnd in the last week of school, a lockdown interrupted an outdoor field day.  Amid the fierce struggle and bouncy house fun, the students were shoved inside.  Ms Macken huddled with her students on the floor of her dark classroom while police investigated a report of a teenager walking down the street with a gun.\n\n\nSource Link",

Born in Shropshire in 1913, Pym began writing early, but had her true intellectual awakening at Oxford, where she met companions who would become not only lifelong friends but role models for her characters.  Popular but not exactly pretty, she fell frequently and painfully in love.  It’s a pattern that will repeat itself throughout Pym’s life.  She had a taste for bad men: unworthy, unavailable or homosexual, sometimes all of that.  She could sacrifice herself to the point of masochism, subsist on crumbs of affection – not only did she work as a secretary for one of them, she paid “30 shillings a week and a few caresses”, but in doing so she found a half-finished love poem he had written to his future (first) wife, written, as Byrne tells us, …",

The combination is leading to unrest and protests from citizens, which democratic governments know from experience is one of the surest ways to lose popularity and power. \nSri Lanka, Laos, Nigeria and Argentina are among emerging economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America that have seen long queues at some filling stations in the past weeks because of fuel shortages.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: With high fuel prices how will goods be transported that will make economic sense for the farmer/store to sell, and for the customer to buy?
