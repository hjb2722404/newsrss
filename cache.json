By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) — Israelis packed city streets on Saturday in nationwide demonstrations now in their 10th week against plans by the hard-right government to curb the Supreme Court's powers, which critics see as a threat to judicial independence.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says his aim is to balance out branches of government, wields a parliamentary majority along with his religious-nationalist coalition allies.\nAs the reforms head toward ratification, the protests have escalated. The shekel has slipped. Some military reservists have threatened not to heed call-up orders. President Isaac Herzog has appealed for the overhaul to be postponed and dialogue held.\n\"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that (is) making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids,\" said Tamir Guytsabri, 58, among tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered in central Tel Aviv.\nThe protests were mostly peaceful, though Reuters witnessed some injuries and arrests among protesters when police moved in against attempts to block traffic.\nNational police chief, Inspector-General Yaacov Shabtai, made a rare televised announcement in which he backed off from plans to reassign the head of Tel Aviv's police, which some feared presaged plans to crack down harder on protests.\nThe now-deferred reassignment was part of a scheduled rotation, Shabtai said, adding that police would continue safeguarding demonstrations kept within legal boundaries and \"will not yield to any political pressure on the matter\".\nNetanyahu, who returned to office for a sixth term in late December, says the demonstrations are aimed at toppling him. He is on trial in three corruption cases and denies all wrongdoing.\n\"I am here to protest against the reform in the law, and to protest our prime minister, who we call 'Crime Minister',\" said demonstrator Miri Lahat, 63.\n(Writing by Dan Williams; editing by John Stonestreet)",

Statistics aside, an influx of inexperienced draftees, brought in to plug the losses, has changed the profile of the Ukrainian force, which is also suffering from basic shortages of ammunition, including artillery shells and mortar bombs, according to military personnel in the field.   \nRead more .... \nWNU Editor: Another pessimistic view of the war from a major US main stream publication.

Ukrainian Presidential Press Office   \nPolitico:  ‘Little fissures’: The U.S.-Ukraine war unity is slowly cracking apart \nA tough week for U.S.-Ukraine news reveals an imperfect harmony. \nThe United States and Ukraine have largely been in lockstep since President Joe Biden’s administration pledged support for “as long as it takes” in resisting Moscow’s relentless invasion. \nBut more than a year into the war, there are growing differences behind the scenes between Washington and Kyiv on war aims, and potential flashpoints loom on how, and when, the conflict will end. \n“The administration doesn’t have a clear policy objective and a clear goal. Is it to drag this thing out, which is precisely what Vladimir Putin wants?” said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Is it to just give them enough to survive and not to win? I don’t see a policy for victory right now, and if we don’t have that, then what are we doing?”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This is an extraordinary article that highlights the divisions that are now growing between Washington and Kyiv. In the article there is nothing but criticisms from US officials on Ukrainian President Zelensky .... and I think this is the first time that I am reading a major US media outlet criticizing the Ukrainian President. \nThere is also US criticisms on Ukrainian war policies, and what is more shocking, are US officials telling Politico that they strongly believe that Ukraine was behind the Nord Stream pipeline attack. There is also criticisms on Ukraine being committed to the defense of Bakhmut against the advice of US military officials. \nBut what struck me were US officials expressing their frustration over constant Ukrainian demands for more weapons and monies, and disappointment that they have not shown the proper appreciation of US efforts. \nNeedless to say. This is a must read article for today.",
