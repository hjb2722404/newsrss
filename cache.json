Michael Kappeler/dpa\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed his ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk, according to a decree published by the presidential chancellery.\nUkraine's ambassadors to Norway, the Czech Republic, Hungary and India were also dismissed, the decree said. It did not state why, or what the diplomats would do in the future.\nMelnyk became known for his repeated demands for more support from the German government, in the form of heavier weapons, as Russia's attacks continued in the war launched by Moscow on February 24.\nRecently, Melnyk came under pressure for defending the Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who led a group responsible for ethnic cleansing and the massacre of tens of thousands of Poles and Jews during World War II.\nMelnyk denied that Bandera was a mass murderer, saying he had been deliberately demonized by the Soviet Union, in comments during an interview.\nThe Israeli embassy accused Melnyk of \"distorting historical facts, trivializing the Holocaust and insulting those who were murdered by Bandera and his people.\"\nMelnyk initially did not respond but later, he rejected the accusation. \"Everyone who knows me, knows: I have always condemned the Holocaust in the strongest possible terms,\" Melnyk tweeted, calling the accusations \"absurd.\"\nMelnyk has served as ambassador to Germany since January 2015, longer than diplomats usually remain in a post. Commentators in Kiev also noted that this was twice the usual posting time.\nSome German media, including Bild and SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspapers, reported that Melnyk is to be moved to the Foreign Ministry in Kiev, citing Ukrainian sources.",

          "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his resignation on Thursday following the recent departures of his government ministers amid a string of political scandals and catastrophes. The news was met with widespread celebration and a goofy soundtrack, courtesy of Hugh Grant.\nEarlier that day, the actor, who plays a fictional U.K. prime minister in the 2003 rom-com \"Love Actually,\" asked activist and Anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray if he could blast \"Yakety Sax\" â aka the iconic theme song for the slapstick comedy \"The Benny Hill Show\" â outside the British Houses of Parliament. The wacky tune, which frequently accompanies the protagonist's ludicrous escapades, is now a stand-in soundtrack for clownery and tomfoolery.\n \"Morning @snb19692,\" tweeted Grant. \"Glad you have your speakers back. Do you by any chance have the Benny Hill music to hand?\"\nLucky for Grant, Bray had the song at his disposal and made sure to play it at full volume for all to hear. The audio can even be heard in the background of a few British news broadcasts, which went viral on social media:\n\n\\u201cMorning @snb19692  Glad you have your speakers back.

She said the truck was on its way to another exhibit 370 miles away at the Pasadena Convention Center in Pasadena.\nBut in circumstances that have not been made public, the merchandise was taken from the truck near Los Angeles early Monday, said Brinkâs spokeswoman Dana Callahan.\n\n\nThe value of the stolen merchandise, which included several gold and diamond necklaces, was not immediately clear.  It was also unclear how many pieces had been taken.\n\n\nOne of the jewelers, who requested anonymity for security reasons given the expensive jewelry he handles, estimated the total value of what was stolen at between $20 million and $50 million.  Ms. Callahan said it was less than $10 million.\nâBased on information customers provided to us prior to shipping their items, the total value of missing items is less than $10 million,â Brinkâs said in a statement.  âWe are working with law enforcement and will fully reimburse our customers for the value of their assets that were stolen, in accordance with the terms of our contract.â\nThe jeweler said Brinkâs was not transparent with jewelry owners and many fundamental questions about the loss remained unanswered.\nNeither authorities nor Brinkâs released details of what happened, including the location of the theft and whether anyone was injured.\n\n\nA spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency was working with local authorities but could not provide more information.

It was more listening to friends and family on what they are going through right now in Ukraine.Â \nSighhh ... it has been a draining day. But I should not complain. I am in Canada where I am safe.Â \nAs for the above video report. Kudos to Dima at the Military Summary YouTube channel spending his day trying to understand the military situation on the ground by compiling both Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministry briefings into something that is meaningful. No one has come close to doing what he is doing, including all those high-paid retired Generals giving their 5 minute analysis on TV that is proven wrong 2 weeks later.Â \nSome other interesting news that I picked up today. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has been making some remarks that is raising a few eyebrows. One .... he says he was misquoted when he said Ukraine will soon have a million soldiers. Reason being that his English is not good. He instead expects something like 700,000 soldiers.Â \nAnd two .... he has been quoted as saying that the Ukraine military has already suffered 100,000 casualties since the start of the war?!?!?!? I have been trying to find other Ukrainian media and government outlets to verify this casualty number, but no luck so far.\n\nRussian media is saying that they have already destroyed a number of US supplied HIMARS systems, and that the Russian military advance continues. I am always skeptical of these reports, but I have noticed a reduction in reports of long range artillery strikes by Ukraine in the past few days.",
