          "description": "United States Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) published an editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal on Wednesday in which he voiced opposition to a ban on the popular app TikTok that passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently being debated in the Senate.\nPaul, a libertarian conservative, attacked the proposal as a surefire way to alienate young voters and assailed it as an affront to Republicans' supposed aversion to censorship.\n\"This GOP strategy comes while polls indicate that 71% of young women and 53% of young men voted for a Democrat candidate for Congress. Now admittedly, many Democrats have joined Republicans in calling for this ban but like most such issues, the blame will stick to Republicans more,\" Paul wrote. \"The banning TikTok strategy also comes while the GOP simultaneously complains of liberal U.S. social media companies canceling and censoring conservatives. So, without a hint of irony, many of these same 'conservatives' now agitate to ban a platform owned by an international group that includes several American investors.\"\nPaul warned that prohibiting Americans from accessing Tiktok means that the US may \"emulate China‚Äôs speech bans,\" noting that the app is already banned in China.\nPaul also wondered, \"does TikTok do the Chinese government‚Äôs bidding?\" noting that \"videos are all over TikTok that are critical of official Chinese positions.\"\nAfter reiterating his fear of censorship, Paul concluded that \"if you don't like TikTok or Facebook or YouTube, don't use them. But don't think any interpretation of the Constitution gives you the right to ban them.\"",

Noel Celis / Pool / Reuters¬†\n¬†Foreign Affairs: Xi Jinping Says He Is Preparing China for War\n\n¬†\nThe World Should Take Him Seriously¬†\nChinese leader Xi Jinping says he is preparing for war. At the annual meeting of China‚Äôs parliament and its top political advisory body in March, Xi wove the theme of war readiness through four separate speeches, in one instance telling his generals to ‚Äúdare to fight.‚Äù His government also announced a 7.2 percent increase in China‚Äôs defense budget, which has doubled over the last decade, as well as plans to make the country less dependent on foreign grain imports. And in recent months, Beijing has unveiled new military readiness laws, new air-raid shelters in cities across the strait from Taiwan, and new ‚ÄúNational Defense Mobilization‚Äù offices countrywide.¬†\nIt is too early to say for certain what these developments mean. Conflict is not certain or imminent. But something has changed in Beijing that policymakers and business leaders worldwide cannot afford to ignore.
