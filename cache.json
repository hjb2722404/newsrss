An autopsy found that he died of cardiac arrhythmia and was malnourished and dehydrated while his body was covered with bed bugs and other insects, according to reports. He was also diagnosed with a schizophrenia disorder that he was not receiving medication for.\nHis attorney said that he had been \"eaten alive.\"\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told reporters that jail inmates \"do not surrender their constitutional and civil rights at the jailhouse door.\" \n“The vast majority of people held in jails have not been convicted. Some are waiting bail hearings, competency evaluations or restoration services, or they were detained because of their inability to post bail. Some will see their charges dropped or are waiting to be transferred to other jurisdictions,\" she said. \nClarke said that Thompson's death was not an isolated incident, pointing to homicides and other violent incidents at the jail. She also called the investigation a \"racial justice issue,\" citing the fact that Thompson was Black and that Black people make up about 87 percent of those held at the jail. \nRead the full report at The Washington Post.",

Image: Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto/picture alliance\n\n \nDW: Kyiv imposes ban on Russian-language culture \nA Temporary ban has been imposed on Russian art and culture in the Ukrainian capital. Human rights activists say the move is discriminatory and unconstitutional. \nStreet musicians singing Russian songs in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv could soon face problems. Likewise, bars and restaurants playing Russian background music may end up getting in trouble. \nThe reason is that Kyiv city council has issued a temporary ban on performing or showcasing Russian-language art and culture — such as books, music, plays and concerts — in public. This ban also encompasses cultural and educational programs. The restriction not only applies to works by Russian authors and creators, but to all cultural products publicly presented in or translated into Russian.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Kiev bans ‘Russian culture’ (RT)\n\n \nWNU Editor: I doubt this is a temporary ban.

Stoddard, RCW: Doubts and Questions About Biden Will Only Grow \nWow, big news broke Tuesday – President Biden’s campaign is officially going to be headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware. For months nervous Democrats have wondered why Biden only had four full-time staffers devoted to his reelection effort and why the campaign wasn’t yet located anywhere. \nThis development will do absolutely nothing, however, to stop the panic within the party that Biden is too old to run for reelection and could easily lose to former President Donald Trump. Sorry, Team Biden, these fears will not be put to rest; they are going to persist and grow. \nThough the White House and the Democratic National Committee may be trying to ignore it, there is suddenly a constant stream of stories in the media about doubts that Biden can make it across the finish line 16 months from now. Though Frank Bruni noted it’s probably too late, he encouraged Democrats in a New York Times column to talk about Hunter Biden, and suggested Biden should step aside: “It might be best, for him and for continued Democratic control of the White House, if he let Democrats choose a different 2024 nominee.”\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: There has been some reporting in the mainstream media on President Biden's cognitive problems as well as possible linkages to his son's business activities when he was Vice President.
