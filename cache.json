          "description": "The United States and China held talks on nuclear arms control, marking the first meeting on this issue since the Obama administration. The talks aim to ease mistrust between the two countries ahead of an expected presidential summit. The US has expressed concern over China's growing nuclear arsenal. While no breakthroughs were expected, the talks are seen as a way to manage the relationship and prevent conflict. China currently has over 500 operational nuclear warheads, with estimates suggesting they could have over 1,000 by 2030. The US has around 3,700 nuclear warheads.",

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

PATHETIC.\"\n\nShe created a social media thread naming some of her friends in the House who didn't have what it took to vote with her. \nThey include current House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who announced he wasn't running for reelection. \n\n\tEarlier in the week, Greene preemptively lashed out after learning that her effort wasn't gaining a coalition in Congress.\n\"I want to remind you, this happened on the same day Hezbollah declared a day of immense anger,\" she said. \"And Rashida Tlaib organized with that group. And they did. They did protest, and they did an insurrection into our Capitol complex, stopping Congress and stopping the Senate.\"\nThe media was quick to take notice of the lawmaker's swing and miss Wednesday.\n\"Colleague Kelly Phares rpts 23 GOPers join Dems to table or kill effort to censure Dem MI Rep Tlaib,\" tweeted Chat Pergram.\nMelanie Zanona also tweeted: \"motion to table — aka kill — MTG’s resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib just passed the House, with help of 23 Republicans.\"\n\nAnd CNN's Manu Raju added that the effort to take on Tlaib quickly died tweeting: \"House kills resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib. 23 Republicans voted with Dems.

Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) blockade appears to be coming to an end, according to an MSNBC report. \nCapitol reporter Ali Vitali said that a group of Republicans were going to take to the Senate floor and force a vote with Democrats to marginalize Tuberville's protest against military promotions that has led to a reduced military readiness for the United States, according to reports.\nAfter a discussion about the absurdity of the protest, host Nicolle Wallace said that she recalled the era when Republicans had to be supportive of the military or they'd be shamed by leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the GOP speaker. \nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?\nTaking to social media, reporter Andrew Desiderio confirmed the reporting, saying that the floor actions will take place tonight, where they will ask for unanimous consent on ending the Tuberville blockade. He said that he was told it would be led by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK). \nThe news comes after reports that McConnell threatened Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) over his bill to stop corporations from being able to give money to campaigns. McConnell reportedly pointed to Hawley in the caucus lunch and said he wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the money from his Senate Leadership PAC. He went on to threaten any member who supported the bill with a primary. \nIt's the first such action heard about from McConnell since he suffered serious injuries from a series of falls and then appeared to freeze at various public press availabilities.",

To honour the King’s lifelong commitment to sustainability, a special birthday coin has also been made from a blend of silver recovered from industrial and medical x-ray films. Those celebrating their 75th birthday in 2023 can submit their name and contact details via the Royal Mint to be in with a chance of receiving an uncirculated £5 commemorative coin. The winners will be drawn at random and asked to provide photographic evidence of age. They will be contacted via email from early December 2023.",

Senior congressional Republicans have urged President Joe Biden to send longer-range missiles to Ukraine, despite pushback from some conservative lawmakers against more aid. \nThe planned aid package for Ukraine includes about $300 million worth of laser-guided munitions to shoot down Russian drones, according to a document seen by Reuters and one of the officials. The funds for those munitions come from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) program, which allows the Biden administration to buy weapons from industry rather than pull from U.S. weapons stocks.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: US Announces New $425 Million Weapons Package for Ukraine (Libertarian Institute)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Here is the list on what is being sent ....
