The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Not all children are taken by force, but evidence is mounting of a coordinated effort to indoctrinate Ukrainian children and send them to Russian foster families. In the southern city of Kherson, witnesses say Russian forces took children from at least two orphanages as they pulled out of the city last October. But thanks to the bravery of locals, some children were saved from deportation. FRANCE 24's Elena Volochine, Andrew Hilliar, Abdelkader Dermas and Olga Ivashchenko report.",

She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.\n© 2023 AFP",

I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!\"\nThe queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.\nFurther back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.\nPeru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.\nHis supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.\nBoluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.\n\"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration,\" said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.\nCongress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.\n\"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,\" added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a \"quagmire.\"\nBut protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.\nIn seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.\nSome of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.\nThose southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.\nAs well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.\nThat resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.\n(AFP)",

It has been successfully tested before and had this one worked, US officials believe Russia President Vladimir Putin would have highlighted the test in his State of the Nation address on Tuesday. n Pr   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate #1: Russia Tested Nuclear Capable Missile During Biden’s Ukraine Trip – CNN (Moscow Times)  \n\nUpdate #2: Russia's 'Satan 2' Sarmat missile can carry more than a dozen nuclear warheads and destroy entire cities - if it ever works (IBTimes)   \nWNU Editor: This blog follows U.S. and Russian missile tests very closely. A few weeks ago the Russian Ministry of Defense did announce that a Russian missile test was slated between February 12 - February 25. But no mention on the type of missile that was gong to be tested, or the exact date. \nSo was a missile test conducted when President Biden was in Ukraine with his nuclear football .... a test that would definitely result in US nuclear alerts being raised around the world and the rest of us not knowing about it? I doubt it.",

Putin added that Russia stands ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the United States does. \nThe New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is the only bilateral nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, which possess the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals and more than 90 percent of its nuclear warheads. \nSince 2010, New START has limited the United States and Russia to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 700 delivery vehicles each.

Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers have been killed, millions have been displaced, large portions of the country are under a brutal Russian occupation and the country’s infrastructure has been shattered. The war has contributed to a global food and energy crisis that has plunged many of the world’s most vulnerable people into a state of desperation. Hundreds of thousands of young Russian men have been sent off to fight in what some feel is a pointless and self-defeating war — and whatever they may feel, it’s a war from which many won’t return. The Kremlin’s rule has become far more brutal and autocratic, and hopes of peaceful coexistence between Russia and the West have been dashed for the foreseeable future.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: It is too early to say who are the unexpected ‘winners’ From the war in Ukraine.

Evan Vucci/Pool via REUTERS \n WNU Editor: There has been nothing but praise in the Western media on President Biden's trip to Kyiv, and deservedly so .... Joe Biden Made a Surprise Visit to Ukraine as Air Raid Sirens Blared (DNYUZ/Vice). More here .... Zelensky on Biden visit to Ukraine: ‘Historic. Timely. Brave.’ (The Hill), and here .... Biden on surprise visit to Ukraine: \"One year later, Kyiv stands\" (Axios). \nBut what is not mentioned in the press is that every Western leader has had to contact the Kremlin that their leader was going to Ukraine at a certain date to make sure that no Russian missiles or air attacks would happen when they are there. President Biden included (link here).\nSo the big question is .... why is the Kremlin permitting Biden, Macron, Scholz, Johnson, Sunak, Trudeau, and other Western leaders to go to Kyiv. If you watch/listen/read Russian news, you would notice immediately that these visits are always being used to reinforce the Kremlin's narrative that this is a war between NATO and Russia. These visits are also being used by the Kremlin to send a message to the non-Western world that the West is a bloc that may threaten you in the future. \nSo why did President Biden go?\n\n\nSome are saying it would have been an embarrassment if he did not go, especially since he is next door in Poland.  But I think the big reason is that many in the Pentagon and in the West are worried on the state of the war, and Biden had to not only go to Ukraine to reinforce US support of the war, but to tell Zelensky personally that the situation must change on the ground or he will lose this conflict.",
