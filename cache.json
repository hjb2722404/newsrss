The French baguette has been added to UNESCO's list of cultural treasures known as 'intangible heritage'. The idea of the register is to protect traditions and skills, such as Belgian beer culture or Neapolitan pizza, so they are not lost over time. But if the French baguette is so popular, why does it need protecting? And how do you make a baguette? We take a closer look.",

Many of these students were reeled in by recruiters who get a hefty sum from these institutions. However, once the students actually get to Northern Cyprus, their dreams crumble. Some are barred from even entering the country. And things aren’t much better for those who do make it in, many of whom are surprised to learn that the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is not actually considered part of the EU. Our Observers told us about the dubious methods employed by a system that values profit above all else.",
