Russian state propaganda is built around the myth of a Ukraine in the hands of \"Nazis\", one where the Russians come to \"liberate\" the \"Russian speakers\". This propaganda is disseminated not only in Russia, but also in the occupied Ukrainian territories, where the population is plunged into a parallel reality.

The French baguette has been added to UNESCO's list of cultural treasures known as 'intangible heritage'. The idea of the register is to protect traditions and skills, such as Belgian beer culture or Neapolitan pizza, so they are not lost over time. But if the French baguette is so popular, why does it need protecting? And how do you make a baguette? We take a closer look.",

Many of these students were reeled in by recruiters who get a hefty sum from these institutions. However, once the students actually get to Northern Cyprus, their dreams crumble. Some are barred from even entering the country. And things aren’t much better for those who do make it in, many of whom are surprised to learn that the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is not actually considered part of the EU.
