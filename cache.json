          "description": "Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt, and Morocco have condemned Israel's targeting of civilians and violations of international law in Gaza. They argue that Israel's right to self-defense does not justify neglecting the rights of Palestinians. The ministers also criticized forced displacement and collective punishment in Gaza, emphasizing the need for a two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state. Both the West Bank and East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, should be part of this solution.",

The Hamas authorities say 4,385 people have died.\nThe boycott by Meta and Google followed other exits by companies and tech figures, including Intel, Siemens and US comedian Amy Poehler and X-Files actor Gillian Anderson.",
