By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

They were weak and hungry when found.\n\"From an infection point of view, they are still considered at high risk due to their nutritional deficit,\" the hospital statement said.\nRelatives say the children managed to survived thanks to Lesly's deep knowledge of survival in the jungle, with its many inherent dangers -- including snakes, predatory animals and armed criminal groups.\nDozens of soldiers remain on the search for Wilson, a dog that formed part of the rescue mission for the children, but went missing in the jungle.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Stockholm's deputy mayor donned red lipstick and bouffant hair as he glammed up in drag for a children's story hour, part of a campaign against \"intolerance and populism\" launched this week.\nJan Jonsson, a 45-year-old member of the center-right Liberal party, is behind the campaign.\nHe launched it in response to the far-right Sweden Democrats' repeated criticism of drag queens hosting children's story hours at libraries and guided tours at Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre.\n\"I'm using myself as a kind of canvas for the drag artists...to be able to say that we think everyone should be free to express themselves,\" he told AFP.\n\"Some political parties have tried to restrict the freedoms for others and especially drag queens.\n\"With this stance, I hope that more will be able to say, 'Okay, now it's enough. Sweden should be a free country'.\"\nIn a televised debate in early May, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson said it was \"insane\" that taxpayers' money was being used for drag queen story hours.\nHe took issue in particular with a drag artist known as \"Shameless Winehore\" but who goes by the name \"Miss Shameless\" for story hours.\nIn a video clip posted on Twitter, Jonsson is seen glammed up wearing a curly blonde wig, fake eyelashes, a sky-blue dress with red flowers and high heels.\nOn a chair, surrounded by children seated on the floor, Jonsson reads a passage from \"The Brothers Lionheart\" by famed Swedish children's author Astrid Lindgren about standing up for your beliefs even if it's dangerous.\n\"Stories are not dangerous for kids. And drag queens aren't either. But populism and intolerance are dangerous for kids and for adults,\" Jonsson says in the advert.\nJonsson has previously fronted a Liberal campaign against Sweden's soaring gang crime, where the slender politician, clad in a floral shirt and blue blazer was dubbed the \"gangs' worst enemy\".\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "New Zealand has officially entered a recession however it is seen as a necessary part of steering the economy back on a sustainable path, says ANZ Chief Economist Sharon Zollner. \n\n“It’s important to note that this is the plan,” Ms Zollner told Sky News Australia.\n\n“So this is a bit different from the typical recession where you get some kind of negative shock and monetary policy goes into overdrive to try and get the economy out of it as fast as possible.\n\n“It’s not clear that’s going to be the plan this time.”",

Russian Ministry of Defense\n\n \nWarzone/The Drive: Ukraine’s Armor Appears To Have A Russian Attack Helicopter Problem \nRussian Ka-52 attack helicopters’ presence at the front highlights the need for highly mobile and survivable short-range air defenses. \nAs Ukraine presses on with its counteroffensive in the south and east, making incremental advances in the process, there is evidence that Russia may be starting to enjoy more aerial access over critical areas near the front lines. \nAs Russia continues to adapt its application of air power, after a fairly dismal start to the campaign, some of its aircraft are now able to operate in a less restricted way, or at least Russia is willing to take on more risk in doing so. Either way, this will put further pressure on the Ukrainian forces, raising questions, in particular, about the availability of mobile short-range air defense systems, or SHORAD. At the very least, as Ukraine gets away from its more entrenched and fixed air defense capabilities, the importance of SHORAD is only going to be underscored.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: It is telling that ten days into the counteroffensive, Ukraine has only shot down one Russian attack helicopter. This tells me two things. Ukraine is clearly lacking surface to air defense missiles, and Russia is dominating the skies along the front.",
