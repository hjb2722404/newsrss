But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Both sides have since accused each other of espionage.\nTaiwan, a self-governed democracy claimed by China, said last week that it had found the remains of a suspected Chinese meteorological balloon and would increase patrols at military facilities.\nTaiwan's defence ministry revealed on February 14 that Chinese balloons have previously flown over the island, without providing details on the number or frequency.\nAt that time, the ministry said it would shoot down any targets that pose a \"high level of threat\", but added that it had not encountered any such threats.\nBeijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure in recent years on Taiwan, which China has vowed to seize one day, by force if necessary.",

Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 2001 hijacked plane attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 people.\nIt came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. \"war on terror\" because of harsh interrogation methods that critics have said amounted to torture.\nThere were 40 detainees when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021. Biden has said he hopes to close the facility. The federal government is barred by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. mainland prisons.\nOn Thursday, the Pentagon announced the repatriation of Abdul Rabbani and Mohammed Rabbani to Pakistan.\nBoth were arrested in 2002. Abdul Rabbani was an al Qaeda facilitator while Mohammed Rabbani was a financial and travel facilitator for prominent al Qaeda leaders, according to the Pentagon's website.\n\"The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.\nA total of 32 detainees remain, of whom 18 are eligible for transfer, the Pentagon said in its statement.\n(Reporting by Costas Pitas in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler))",

Ricardo Rubio/EUROPA PRESS/dpa\nThe legendary Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is the focus of this year's ARCO 2023, the contemporary art fair held in Madrid, a half-century after his death.\nThe 42nd ARCO was opened on Thursday by the King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.\nA hyper-realistic replica of Picasso's \"corpse,\" wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt typical of the artist and laid out on a kind of tombstone, is the star exhibit.\nSpanish artist Eugenio Merino's sensational sculpture, entitled \"Aquí murió Picasso\" (Here Picasso died), is a denunciation of the exploitation of the figure of the artist for commercial and tourist purposes, especially in Picasso's native city of Málaga.\nLong queues of onlookers quickly formed in front of the work, which is on the market for €45,000 ($47,600), according to the newspaper El País.\nMany visitors took photos and selfies. So far they are all invited guests - including politicians, art dealers, collectors and journalists - as the fair does not open to the general public until Friday. By Sunday, the organizers expect around 100,000 visitors.\nAlongside this sculpture, numerous works by Picasso himself, who together with the Frenchman Georges Braque is considered the founder of Cubism, are on display at the IFEMA exhibition centre in the Spanish capital.\nThere is no guest country at ARCO this year. The theme is \"The Mediterranean: A Round Sea.\"\nA total of 211 galleries from three dozen countries are taking part in ARCO 2023. After the host country Spain, Germany is the most strongly represented, with 29 galleries showing works.",

          "description": "A six-decade archive charting pop icon David Bowie's career will open in London in 2025, providing a \"new source book for the Bowies of tomorrow\", a museum director said Wednesday.\nDirector of the Victoria and Albert Museum Tristram Hunt said the \"incredible\" collection had more than 80,000 items of Bowie memorabilia.\nThey range from hand-written lyrics and letters to sheet music, original costumes, photography and album artwork.\nA number of instruments owned by Bowie as well as music videos, set designs and awards are also due to go on display.\nBowie, originally from south London, died in 2016 at the age of 69.\nThe collection will be housed at the Bowie Centre for the Study of Performing Arts, a new outpost of London's Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThe museum was delighted to be become \"custodians of his incredible archive, and to be able to open it up for the public\", said Hunt.\n\"Bowie's radical innovations across music, theatre, film, fashion, and style -– from Berlin to Tokyo to London – continue to influence design and visual culture and inspire creatives from Janelle Monae to Lady Gaga to Tilda Swinton and Raf Simons,\" he added.\nBowie enjoyed an extraordinary career generating around 140 million record sales and taking in styles from glam rock to jazz, as well as stage personas such as Ziggy Stardust.\nThe new centre will be located at the V&A East Storehouse venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London.\nThe museum said this had been made possible through a £10 million (around $12 million) joint donation by the Blavatnik Family Foundation and Warner Music Group.\nBowie's estate sold the publishing rights to his \"entire body of work\" to Warner last year.\nThe centre meant his life's work was now taking its \"rightful place amongst many other cultural icons and artistic geniuses\", said a spokesperson from the David Bowie Estate.\nThe behind-the-scenes access the new venue offers \"will mean David's work can be shared with the public in ways that haven't been possible before\".\n© 2023 AFP",

Burns told @margbrennan that the U.S. is hoping to \"deter\" Beijing from making a \"very risky and unwise bet.” pic.twitter.com/9iD5XLGAy0\n— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) February 25, 2023\n   CBS News: CIA confirms possibility of Chinese lethal aid to Russia \nIn an exclusive interview with CBS News, CIA Director Bill Burns confirmed the possibility that China may send lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine. \n\"We're confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment,\" Burns told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Friday. \nThe revelation that China's President Xi Jinping is mulling this escalation is a dramatic change from past Biden administration assessments. Earlier this month, Burns told students at Georgetown University that Xi had been \"very reluctant to provide the kind of lethal weapons to Russia to use in Ukraine that the Russians are very much interested in.\" \nBurns emphasized that China has not yet made the decision to transfer lethal aid to Russia, and shed light on the logic behind the Biden administration's decision to make this intelligence public.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: CIA Director William Burns says China has not yet made the decision to transfer lethal aid to Russia. But even though the above twitter video is a short clip, listening to him my gut tells me that the CIA Director already knows Beijing will soon start shipping lethal weaponry and ammunition to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine. \nIt is only a question of when the logistics are in place to make it happen, and if China's roadmap to end the Russia - Ukraine war is ignored. Since the US and its European allies have already rejected China's \"peace plan\" to end the war (link here), it looks like that decision may come sooner rather than later.",

Photo by Aly Song/Reuters   \nVOA: US Army Officials Confident in Competition with China  \nWASHINGTON — Not all branches of the U.S. military are equally worried about keeping pace with China’s military expansion. \nWhile U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro warned earlier this week that he needed more ships to meet the threat posed by China’s rapidly expanding naval forces, top Army officials believe U.S. ground forces still hold a critical edge over their Chinese counterparts. \n“The human dimension of the United States Army, I think, is a comparative advantage,” U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth cautioned during a breakfast in Washington on Thursday with the Defense Writers Group. “The quality of how our soldiers are trained, the kind of leaders that they have, the kind of combat experience that the force has.” \nArmy Chief of Staff General James McConville added that the quality of leadership, especially that rising from the ranks of the Army’s enlisted soldiers, cannot be understated.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: PLA ground forces boast about 975,000 active-duty personnel.
