Sputnik/Sergei Karpukhin/Pool via Reuters \n\n \nThe Diplomat: The China-Russia Partnership After Prigozhin’s Mutiny: The View From Beijing \nWhile Chinese analysts – and likely the government – recognize the weaknesses of the Putin regime, Beijing is unlikely to fundamentally reassess its alignment with Moscow in the near term. \nJune 24 saw the swift beginning and end of a puzzling series of events in Russia. The mercurial Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the private military contractor Wagner Group, announced that his fighters would be undertaking what he termed a “march for justice” aimed squarely against the “incompetence” of the leadership of the Russian Ministry of Defense, namely Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov. \nRead more .... \n Update #1: What Beijing’s muted response to Wagner mutiny tells us about China-Russia relations – and what it doesn’t (The Conversation)\n \nUpdate #2: Wagner mutiny shows China’s ‘no limits’ partnership with Russia is a risky bet (SCMP)\n\n \nWNU Editor: There has been a lot of commentary in the past week on China's response to the Wagner mutiny. The consensus among most of the pundits is that there will be no change in the relationship. \nI disagree. \nI personally think Beijing is going to double down on its support for Putin. Beijing views its relationship with Russia as a vital strategic security ally that must be defended. Any threat to Putin's rule is not in China's interest. \nSo how will China respond? \nAside from continuing to provide political support, they will primarily respond by pumping even more money into the Russian economy and government coffers by doing things like this .... China is now importing more Russian oil than ever before - and Europe has almost entirely stopped buying crude from Moscow (Business Insider).",

Reuters\n\n \nReuters: Hungary opposes EU plan to grant more money to Ukraine -PM Orban \nBUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary rejects the European Commission's plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU's increased debt service costs, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told state radio on Friday. \nOrban, speaking on the sidelines of the EU summit in Brussels, said it was a \"ridiculous\" request from the Commission that Hungary should contribute more money, when Budapest - along with Poland - has not received funds from the EU's Recovery Fund amid a rule of law dispute. \nThe European Union will provide Ukraine with 50 billion euros ($54.30 billion) in aid for 2024-27, the bloc's president said on June 20. This comes after a review of the EU's 2021-27 shared budget, which has been depleted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and an energy crisis. High inflation and interest rates have also doubled debt-servicing costs. \n\"One thing is clear, we Hungarians ... will not give more money to Ukraine until they say where the previous around 70 billion euros worth of funds had gone,\" Orban said.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Ukraine must explain how €70 billion was spent – EU state (RT)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction. There is going to be no accounting on how Ukraine is spending Western aid.",
