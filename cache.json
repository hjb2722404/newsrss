          "description": "Hong Kong recently unveiled a list of its best – and worst – public toilets, with the Peak Tower, a shopping complex popular with tourists, winning the gold medal. But the city has another gold standard loo-related achievement, Hong Kong holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive toilet bowl, a golden creation worth HK$27 million (US$3.5 million). The solid-gold “throne” formed part of a gaudy jewellery showroom built using two tonnes of the precious metal which carried an overall price tag US$38 million. Swisshorn Gold Palace, which was also known as The Golden House and the Hall of Gold, was in the city’s Kowloon area and it boasted a floor-to-ceiling gold design, including a gold horse-drawn chariot, gold chandeliers and life-size gold statues. Even the cutlery and crockery was gold.  But behind a door with engraved pharaohs, Greek gods and harp-playing angels, stood the palace’s crown jewel: a fully functional solid gold toilet. After opening to the public in September 2006, it attracted thousands of visitors a day, mostly tourists from mainland China. The venue was also hired out for weddings and corporate events. The man with the Midas touch behind the project was entrepreneur Lam Sai-wing who moved to Hong Kong from Guangdong province in southern China when he was 21 and went on to become chairman of the jewellery-making company Hang Fung Gold Technology.  Lam wanted to build a shrine to his boyhood hero, Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, who had said that after the victory of socialism, gold should be used to make toilets. “It has been my dream to build this since I was 16 years old. Now it has come true,” said Lam in a story published in the Post in 2002. “I’m a capitalist with socialist principles,” he said at the time, adding: “This toilet is for the public, I wouldn’t have one at home.” But in 2008, the economy - and Lam’s company - was hit by the fallout from the global financial crisis. What wasn’t suffering, however, was the price of gold: in 2008 it had reached an all-time record…",

It’s perhaps a natural path for any traitor... He betrayed his entire Soviet past,” he said. “Our weapon-makers are more talented anyway. Our men are more ingenious because we’re Russians—of many different nationalities. God is with us! Either we will win, or humanity will cease to exist, because the Lord won’t stand for the triumph of warriors of the Antichrist.

It has also completed preparations for what would be its first nuclear test since 2017, Seoul and Washington officials said.\n(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; editing by Stephen Coates)",

          "description": "Will it be the end of \"sir\" and \"ma'am\"? (Lance Cpl. Dakota Dodd/Marine Corps)   \nMarine Times: Why the Marine Corps may nix gender identifiers for drill instructors \nA new academic report on efforts to integrate Marine Corps boot camp recommends dropping gender-specific salutations for drill instructors, but service leaders are not convinced they want to take that step. \nThe lengthy report, commissioned by the Corps from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020 and completed in 2022, points out that half of the military services already have done away with gendered identifiers for training staff. \n“The Army, Navy, and Coast Guard effectively de-emphasize gender in an integrated environment,” the report states. “Instead of saying ‘ma’am’ or ‘sir,’ recruits in these Services refer to their drill instructors using their ranks or roles followed by their last names. Gendered identifiers prime recruits to think about or visually search for a drill instructor’s gender first, before their rank or role.”   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: This is not your grandfather's military. \nUS Marine Corps Considering Dropping ‘Yes Sir’ And 'Yes Ma'am' For Gender Equity   \nMarines told to stop using ‘sir,’ ‘ma’am’ to avoid ‘misgendering’ superiors -- NYPost  \nMarine Corps may drop ‘ma’am’ and ‘sir’ over gender-neutral concerns for drill instructors -- American Military News  \nMarine Corps may drop ‘yes sir’ for gender equity -- RT",
