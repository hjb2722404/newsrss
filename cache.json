          "description": "Kenyan police are investigating the killing of an LGBTQ rights activist whose body was discovered stuffed in a metal trunk in a killing that has sparked national outrage.\nEdwin Chiloba, a 25-year-old fashion designer and model, was found dead by the roadside Wednesday some 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the Rift Valley town of Eldoret, media reports said.\nPolice spokesperson Resila Onyango told Kenya's The Star newspaper that the motive of the killing was still unknown.\n\"Experts are handling the matter,\" Onyango said.\nRights activists have called for speedy investigations into attacks on LGBTQ people who face a precarious existence in the predominantly conservative Christian nation.\nHomosexuality is taboo in Kenya and across much of Africa, and gays often face discrimination or persecution.\nAttempts to overturn British colonial-era laws banning homosexuality in Kenya have proven unsuccessful, and gay sex remains a punishable crime with penalties that include imprisonment of up to 14 years.\n\"It is truly worrisome that we continue to witness escalation in violence targeting LGBTQ+ Kenyans,\" the Kenya Human Rights Commission said in a statement on Friday.\n\"Everyday, the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons are being violated with little consequence for perpetrators,\" it added, urging the police \"to conduct swift investigations and ensure the killers are apprehended and prosecuted\".\nThe Kenya LGBTQ Feminist Forum in western Kenya where Chiloba lived, said he had used \"fashion to deconstruct gender and advocate for the rights of the marginalized group\".\n\"We want to know as a community as Kenyans, what happened to Edwin, why he was murdered and who dropped his body at the scene,\" the group's programs director Becky Mududa said.\nThe death of Chiloba comes after another LGBTQ activist was found murdered in April last year.\n© 2023 AFP",

Taiwan vows to defend itself if attacked, saying Beijing's sovereignty claims are void as the People's Republic of China has never governed the island.\nA Chinese military plane came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. air force aircraft in the contested South China Sea last month and forced it to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace.\nThe close encounter followed what the United States has called a recent trend of increasingly dangerous behavior by Chinese military aircraft.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Additional reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)",

Neither the zoo nor the property owner has filed a response to the lawsuit and none of the allegations have been proven in court.\"\nThe lawsuit argues that the zoo knew the bears had a history of being \"vicious\", but did not take adequate steps to secure the enclosure in a way that would prevent small children from reaching inside.\n\"The statement of claim says the zoo failed to provide 'any adequate warning of the dangerous conditions' on the premises,\" said the report. \"It claims damages for pain, suffering and loss of life enjoyment, loss of income earning capacity and costs of future care for the girl.\"\nZoo attacks are uncommon, but can be highly dangerous. Two years ago, a 20-year-old gift shop janitor at a zoo in Naples, Florida was hospitalized after entering a tiger enclosure, where he was mauled in the attempt of \"petting or feeding\" the animals.",

The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, spoke on Twitter of \"contemptible criminal behaviour\" by the perpetrators. \"I hope the police will investigate, find these guys and bring them to justice.\"\nThe desecrated graves included those of three Palestinian police officers and members of various Protestant congregations, according to media reports, including bishop Samuel Gobat, Jerusalem's second Protestant bishop. He had bought the land for the cemetery.\nThe cemetery has been desecrated before and there have been previous incidents of hostility towards Christians in Jerusalem.\nA general view shows vandalized graves in a Protestant cemetery on Mount Zion. nknown vandals desecrated a Protestant cemetery in Jerusalem, damaging more than 30 gravestones, according to Israeli media reports.
