          "description": "Uganda has seen a new wave of hatred and “anti-gay” demonstrations sweep through the country since January after a case of suspected paedophilia in a school became a pretext to condemn the entire LGBT community. Homosexuality is illegal in the country and punishable by imprisonment. But the authorities, including the president and his wife, want to strengthen anti-LGBTQ+ laws, and condemn being openly gay. Parliament passed a new “anti-homosexual” bill at the end of March, which worries the gay community in the country and has provoked outrage from many Ugandan and Western NGOs.",

The documents, which carry markings suggesting that they are highly classified, have led to a string of stories about the war in Ukraine, protests in Israel and how the U.S. surveils friend and foe alike.\nThe source of the documents is not publicly known, but reporting by the open-source investigative site Bellingcat has traced their earliest appearance to Discord, a communications platform popular with gamers.\nDiscord's statement suggested it was already in touch with investigators.\n\"In regards to the apparent breach of classified material, we are cooperating with law enforcement,\" the statement said. \"As this remains an active investigation, we cannot provide further comment at this time.\"\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\nAlthough the documents only began drawing attention recently, Bellingcat said it found evidence that at least some of the files had been floating around on social media as far back as March or even January.\nBellingcat cited Discord users who it said gave similar accounts of the documents' provenance but cautioned that it was unable to independently verify all the information they shared.\nReuters could not immediately corroborate Bellingcat's reporting; attempts to reach former members of the server via the social media site Reddit and other servers on Discord were not immediately successful.\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Josie Kao)",

Now, a contract with Boeing issued on Taiwan’s behalf by the US Naval Air Systems Command marks a first for the mobile, land-launched version, according to Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council. Three other people familiar with the deal, including an industry official, confirmed the contract is for Taiwan. \nThe Pentagon announced the $1.7 billion contract with Boeing on April 7 but made no mention of Taiwan as the purchaser. The deal comes as US-China tensions are high, particularly over Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims as part of its territory.

          "description": "Atlantic Council: Putin cancels Victory Day parades as Ukraine invasion continues to unravel \nWith Russia’s annual Victory Day celebrations less than one month away, the Kremlin has taken the highly unusual step of canceling a number of military parades in regional capitals. Scheduled parades to mark the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi Germany have been called off in Kursk and Belgorod oblasts, which both border Ukraine. Victory Day celebrations in Russian-occupied Crimea have also reportedly been scrapped. \nThe cancellations are officially due to security concerns related to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, numerous commentators have speculated that Moscow is also increasingly short of tanks and is understandably eager to avoid highlighting the scale of the losses suffered by the Russian army in Ukraine. Whether the real reason is security issues or equipment shortages, the decision to cancel this year’s Victory Day parades represents a painful blow for Vladimir Putin that hints at the grim reality behind Moscow’s upbeat propaganda portrayals of his faltering Ukraine invasion. \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: There is a lot of speculation from Western media sources on why this year's Victory Day celebrations got cancelled in a number of regional capitals. Not enough tanks/equipment and security concerns are often cited. I think the reason why these parades were cancelled is more basic. Everyone's focus in Russia right now is on winning the war, and not on having a parade. \nUpdate: It is not only the Victory Day parades that are being cancelled .... May 1 parade in Moscow cancelled due to \"terror attacks\" threat (The New Voice of Ukraine).",

But the inflation we're living with today in Argentina is terrible. It feels like never before,\" said Claudia Hernansaez, a publishing company employee.\n\n\"In my case, I have zero capacity to save.\" \nThe soaring prices have hammered salaries and spending power, pushed up poverty to near 40%, and dented the popularity of the governing Peronist coalition as general elections near.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Argentinians buckle under 104.3 percent inflation (Al Jazeera).\n\n \nWNU Editor: Argentina is not the only country facing sky-high inflation rates ....
