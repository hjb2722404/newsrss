Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, China, which accounted for about half of Tesla's global deliveries last year.\nMusk is also CEO of rocket and satellite internet company SpaceX, among others.\nMusk previously suggested that tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing. Musk also said China has sought assurances that he would not offer SpaceX's Starlink internet service there.\nHe also proposed Ukraine permanently cede Crimea to Russia, while saying SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.\nIan Bremmer, head of political-risk consultancy Eurasia Group, tweeted that Musk told him that he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine.

          "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a guest appearance on reality TV show \"Drag Race,\" it was announced Tuesday, though some viewers may be disappointed he will not compete as one of the cross-dressing contestants.\nThe Canadian show is among a dozen international versions of the original American series \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" that has inspired spin-offs including \"Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World.\"\n\"The prime minister's visit marks the first time a world leader has made an appearance on a Drag Race franchise,\" local broadcaster Bell Media said in a statement.\nPublicist Ama Sechere told AFP that on the show Trudeau \"talks to the queens about Canada's inclusivity and offers his support to Canadian competitors going up against international queens,\" whom he welcomes to Canada.\nContestants are given different challenges each week to test their drag performance skills, which are judged by a panel, and share with the audience their personal struggles and successes.\nIn a series trailer, Trudeau is shown being introduced as a surprise guest by host and judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, who is clad in a sparkling black gown.\nThe room explodes in audience screams as Trudeau comes out on stage with a broad smile, wearing a buttoned-down shirt with sleeves rolled up and a tie.\nThe show premieres on November 18 in Canada on Bell's streaming service Crave. Dates for screenings abroad have yet to be announced.\n© 2022 AFP",

I would even say that for a majority of Americans it was not even on their top 10 issues of concern. \nThe debacle and surrender in Afghanistan. The war in Ukraine. Growing tensions with China. Worsening tensions with North Korea. The fracturing of the global order into multi-polar blocs that are hostile to US interests. The weaponization of the US dollar's status as the world's global reserve currency. All of these issues were not raised, debated, or discussed. \nWhat this means is that there will be no personnel changes or changes in policies when it comes to the Pentagon and national security issues, imposing financial and economic sanctions as a tool of US foreign policy, the war in Ukraine, and raising tensions against China.\nMy biggest worry is that there are probably some in the White House who will see the elections results as a green-light to double down on their policies. \nWhat this means is even more support and involvement, maybe even direct involvement, in the war in Ukraine. The weaponization of the dollar. A more aggressive posture against China. And an even more aggressive approach towards countries like Saudi Arabia to not divert away from the American sphere of influence as they try their best to distance themselves away from Washington DC (i.e. Saudi Crown Prince Salman meeting Chinese President Xi next month to foster closer ties).\nI do not see any lessening of tensions in 2023. In fact. I see it becoming far worse as the US does what it feels it must do to maintain its status as the world's global super-power.",

Picture: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters \nWNU editor: President Biden and the White House should be happy. Correction. They should be overjoyed!\nAll the expectations of a red wave fell flat.\n\nKeeping control of the US Senate will mean his court and executive office appointees will still be approved.\nThere is an outside chance that the Democrats may still keep control of the House of Representatives. But even if they do lose the House, the Republican majority will be so small, maybe by a seat or two, that blocking the President's agenda will be challenge for the Republican leadership. \nWithin the Democrat party itself, the push to convince President Biden to not run in the 2024 Presidential race is going to fall silent. \nPresident Biden, at least publicly, has stated that he will run in 2024. Unless there is a change in his physical health by then, he and Kamala Harris will be on the ticket for 2024. \nAnd as to questions on President Biden's mental capacity to run in 2024. As John Fetterman's Senate victory in Pennsylvania has shown. Being mentally impaired after suffering a stroke and facing years of rehabilitation was not an obstacle for him to run for office and to win convincingly. \nSo what do I expect from the White House in the next two years?\nI expect the White House, with help from the media, to say that this election cycle validated President Biden's policies, and he has mandate to continue on. \nPolicy wise the White House and the Democrats in Congress are going to double down on their domestic agenda and policies. Ditto on foreign policy.",
