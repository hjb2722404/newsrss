In the past three months, three unique artworks by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso have been found, in strange and unexpected circumstances. Is this a coincidence or not? \nWhen the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, won a landslide victory in May, 2022, he went to visit the home of his mother Imelda, former first lady and wife of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. \nIn a video showing mother congratulating son, one detail in Imelda’s opulent home stood out. On the wall, was a distinctive painting of an abstract nude rendered in blues and greens, on a red and orange bed. It was unmistakably Pablo Picasso’s “Femme Couchée VI”. \nThe painting was one of more than 200 that Imelda a…",

Were Pelosi to go, it would be the most senior-level US official visit to the self-ruled island -- which China claims is part of its territory -- under the Biden administration.\nPelosi also raised the possibility of a military escalation from China, saying Thursday: \"Maybe the military was afraid our plane would get shot down or something like that by the Chinese.\"",

Among those agencies is the Department of Defense (DOD) with its relatively new interagency support authority, the Defense Support to Stabilization, or DSS. This new authority allows DOD to provide logistical support, supplies and services to other federal agencies so that critical civilian expertise can be in place quickly and efficiently for a unity of effort that the interagency may have lacked in the past.\nTo read these Semi-Annual Lesson Reports: Defense Support to Stabilization (DSS), click on the links below:\nVolume I: https://pksoi.armywarcollege.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PKSOI-DSS-SAR-I.pdf\nVolume II: https://pksoi.armywarcollege.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PKSOI-DSS-SAR-II.pdf\nSource: \"Semiannual Lesson Report: Defense Support to Stabilization, Volume I.\" Peacekeeping Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI).

          "description": "Since “Lemonade” (2016), her last solo studio album and accompanying film, Beyoncé has overwhelmed fans with a number of ambitious in-between projects.\nIn 2018, she performed as one of the headliners of the Coachella festival, where her show honored the tradition of historically black college and university marching bands, and was widely hailed as a triumph — one that “redirected its music, discarding its ties to pop and framing it squarely in a line of Southern black musical traditions,” as New York Times critic Jon Caramanica wrote.  The performance was later made into a Netflix special and an album, both titled “Homecoming.”\nAlso in 2018, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, her husband, released a joint album, “All is love” credited to the Carters.  And in June 2020, at the height of nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd, she released a song, “Black Parade”, with lines like “Put your fist up, show black love.”\n“Black Parade” won the Grammy Award the following year for Best R&B Performance, one of four prizes that night it took Beyoncé’s career to 28 – more than any other woman.  This year, Beyoncé was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song for “Be Alive,” from the movie “King Richard,” a biopic about Venus and Serena Williams’ father.\nHow the early leak will affect the commercial prospects of “Renaissance” remains unclear.  Years ago, the unauthorized release of music in advance could have devastating consequences for an album.  But that danger has been mitigated by the move to streaming.\nAnd Beyoncé, like most other artists today, has taken advance orders for physical copies of her album, which will count on the charts as soon as they ship — usually the week of release.  On Beyoncé’s site, all four boxes of “Renaissance” and its limited-edition vinyl version are sold out.\n\nSource Link",

They had just come from three weeks off and were back in company class, preparing for a tour of upstate New York.  Some carried energy drinks and bottles of hand sanitizer;  others brought their dogs, who sat under the barre as the dancers began a series of exercises – bends, stretches, jumps and pirouettes.\nTall and majestic, Chun Wai Chan stood near the center of the studio.  In May, he became the first Chinese-born principal dancer in City Ballet’s 74-year history, only the fourth Asian to hold the rank.  In the studio that morning, some dancers were still loosening up their routines.  But he was brimming with energy, vowin…",
