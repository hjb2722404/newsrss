In addition to this crucial skill, the ability to ask questions plays an equally important role in both learning and managing unforeseen risks. \"By creating an environment that values curiosity and encourages students to ask questions and seek answers, students develop a deeper understanding of the subjects they engage with, they become more self-reliant and better prepared to navigate the challenges of our ever-changing world,\" Lang explains.¬†\r \r Lang continues, \"Projects are great in developing these life skills and work wonderfully in demonstrating the skills!

And here's the thing. There's a lot to dislike, sort of every link of the chain here. First of all, the FBI writes down lots of things that human informants and confidential informants say. That doesn't mean it is necessarily true. Yes, they record it in a form, 1023, but they write it down. It doesn't mean it's verified, it doesn't mean it's accurate, it doesn't mean it's reliable. Once they receive it, they have to go about the hard work of corroborating it, or debunking it. And it sounds like the FBI never corroborated, and indeed, ultimately debunked this disinformation.\"\nHe continued:\n\"So why this debunked Russian disinformation would then be handed off to Republican members of Congress to be used as the basis to impeach an American president is mystifying, Ayman. And look, let's use Jim Jordan as an example. You played a clip of him appearing to double down, even though he now knows it's Russian disinformation, and Smirnov has been indicted for lying to the FBI about the Bidens. Jim Jordan is a serial abuser of his position and his authority.
