He expressed concern that Russia may escalate its campaign of systematic strikes on Ukraine's energy grid, leaving thousands without heating or electricity during the winter. Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of defense and called on the international community for support. Ukraine has been strengthening its air defense systems, but Zelenskyy acknowledged that further improvements are needed to fully protect the entire territory.",

Biden wants to manage economic competition with China and prevent misunderstandings that could lead to conflict. He also aims to reopen military communications and ensure the status quo in Taiwan. Additionally, Biden wants China to use its influence with Iran to prevent escalation of the Israel-Hamas war, and he will make it clear that Chinese interference in the US election will not be tolerated.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. âNearly every commerciaâ¦",

Strickland,\" the Vatican said in a statement.\nIt said the bishop of Austin, Joe Vasquez, had been named as apostolic administrator of the diocese, but gave no further details.\nThe Vatican has not said what sparked the apostolic visitation this summer -- which Strickland himself made public -- or what conclusions were drawn.\nBut Strickland, appointed by former pope Benedict XVI in 2012, was one of the most prominent critics of Pope Francis.\nThe Argentine pope, 86, has sought to forge a more compassionate Church, open to different views.\nBut he has faced intense opposition from critics -- particularly in the United States -- who accused him of causing confusion and failing to uphold key Catholic beliefs.\nIn a message earlier this year on X, formerly Twitter, Strickland accused the pope of \"undermining the deposit of faith\".\nIn a blog posted on his website in September, the bishop addressed rumours that he was being encouraged by the Vatican to step down.\n\"I cannot resign as bishop of Tyler because that would be me abandoning the flock\" under his care, he wrote.\n\"I have also said that I will respect the authority of Pope Francis if he removes me from office as Bishop of Tyler,\" he wrote.\n\"I love Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church which He established. My only desire is to speak His Truth and live God's Will to the best of my ability,\" he wrote.\nThe diocese of Tyler on Saturday announced the Vatican's decision to dismiss the bishop on its website, saying: \"Our work as the Catholic Church in northeast Texas continues.\"\nÂ© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) is moving ahead with a subpoena against Los Angeles-based real estate investor Elizabeth Hirsch Naftali, who purchased art from Hunter Biden â despite the fact that Naftali is currently dealing with her three-year-old niece being held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip following the 10/7 terrorist attack.\nRep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) is enraged by this, issuing a statement accusing the Republican chairman of abusing his power to harass the family of a terror victim.\n\"In the clearest sign yet of House Republicans' devious and distorted priorities, Chairman Comer has decided to subpoena a private American citizen whose 3-year-old niece is currently being held hostage in Gaza by the terrorist group Hamas,\" said Goldman. \"Despite no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, House Republicans are spending their time attacking the grieving family of a Hamas hostage rather than working to get that hostage released.\"\n\"Chairman Comer's behavior is disgusting,\" continued Goldman. \"In his soulless desperation to smear President Biden ahead of the 2024 election, he has stooped to an entirely new low of abandoning the American families of hostages in a pathetic attempt to score political points against President Biden. In this trying time at home and around the world, the American people cannot tolerate this wild goose chase anymore. It must stop immediately.\"\nComer has spent months trying to look for solid evidence that the president has been laundering bribes through his son's international business deals. No such evidence has yet emerged, and many of their hearings with Hunter Biden's business associates have if anything provided evidence of the opposite.\nThe investigation has been folded into a broader impeachment inquiry into the president, which as of now has not actually formulated a theory of charges against him.",
