NATO on Saturday urged Kosovo to dial down tensions.\nThe clashes led Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday to place the army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.\n\"We decisively condemn Pristina's provocative steps, which have brought the situation close to the hot phase and directly threaten the security of the whole Balkans region,\" Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.\n\"The responsibility for this lies fully with the United States and the European Union,\" she said, adding that rebukes of Kosovo by \"Western mediators\" had come too late.\nSerbia and its traditional ally Russia do not recognise Kosovo's independence, and Moscow has blocked the country's bid to become a member of the United Nations. Serbia still considers Kosovo part of its territory.\n(Reporting by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Conor Humphries)",

And they’re not American \nSeoul, South Korea CNN  — It’s a growing problem that has United States naval commanders scratching their heads: How to keep up with China’s ever-expanding fleet of warships. \nNot only is China’s navy already the world’s largest, its numerical lead over the US is getting wider, with the head of the US Navy warning recently that American shipyards simply can’t keep up. Some experts estimate China can build three warships in the time it takes the US to build one. \nIt is just one of the concerns, alongside Beijing’s increasing aggression in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, that’s likely to be weighing on the mind of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as he joins top military figures from across the region at this weekend’s Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. \n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nWNU Editor: Building US-designed vessels in Japan or South Korean shipyards may make sense economically.
