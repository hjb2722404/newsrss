But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

According to President Joe Biden's administration, investigators foiled another plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States.\nAmong the most startling details in the Justice Department's statement is an alleged revelation from Gupta to an undercover DEA agent that another Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, \"was also the target.\" \nIn fact, he revealed, \"We have so many targets.\"\nALSO READ: You might think the NFL is racist. An insider says he’s about to prove it in court.\nSikh groups, including some active in the United States and Canada, have vocally advocated for their own state to be parsed out of India. \nThe Diplomat detailed leaked Pakistani documents it says point to an assassination program being orchestrated by India, though the site claimed the leak is attempting to capitalize on India's negative publicity. \nThe Intercept's report last week also cited the same intelligence assessment, saying that the Indian government's \"Research and Analysis Wing\" has been plotting a global assassination plot in several countries in a coordinated effort to target Sikh and Kashmiri activists abroad. \nRead the full court filing by the DOJ here.",

Navarro) \nPolitico:  ‘We’re taking it out of hide’: Pentagon says it has no money for Middle East buildup\n\n \nUnder the temporary budget, funding is frozen at the previous year’s levels. \nThe Defense Department has ordered an additional aircraft carrier strike group, air defenses, fighter jets and hundreds of troops to the Middle East since the surprise terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, in an effort to prevent the conflict from spiraling into a regional war. \nThe problem: Congressional dysfunction means the Pentagon has no money to pay for the buildup. \nThe military, like the rest of the federal government, is operating under a temporary funding measure that freezes spending at the previous year’s levels. And because the Middle East troop movements weren’t planned, the Pentagon has had to pull money from existing operations and maintenance accounts, DOD spokesperson Chris Sherwood said. President Joe Biden signed the stopgap measure this month to keep the government open until lawmakers can agree on a full-year spending bill. \nBecause DOD had to hunt for funds, that means less money for training, exercises and deployments the military had already planned for the year. Some contractual payments could be delayed, Sherwood said.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate #1: Military to Curtail Recruiting and Duty Station Moves if Congress Resorts to a Yearlong Stopgap Budget, Joint Chiefs Chairman Warns (Military.com)\n \nUpdate #2: Top US general warns lawmakers of funding crisis (RT)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Some are not buying the Pentagon story that they are running out of money ....
