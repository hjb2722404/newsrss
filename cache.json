          "description": "<p>STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Feb 23 (IPS)  - At <em>Statens Museum for Kunst</em> in Copenhagen there is a great painting made in 1797 by the <em>Danish Golden Age</em> painter Jens Juel. It depicts one of Denmark’s richest merchants at the time – Niels Ryberg, his newlywed son Johan Christian, and the son’s bride, Engelke. Johan Christian makes a gesture as though to show off the family estate. There is a strong feeling of harmony between the people and the countryside in which they are placed. The picture reflects the new interest in nature that emerged all over Europe towards the end of the 18th century. It also demonstrates how Denmark’s new, rich bourgeois wished to carry themselves in the style of the aristocracy, a social class which dominance they were infringing. Ryberg and his son appear just as distinguished as the aristocrats that used to be portrayed by Jens Juel.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2024/02/23/36072\">Read the full story, “No God but Greed: Slavery and Indifference”, on globalissues.org</a> →</p>",

          "description": "Brian Mann covers the U-S opioid and fentanyl crisis for NPR. That means he talks to a lot of people struggling with addiction. Again and again, he's heard stories of people who have succumbed to their addiction — last year 112, 000 — more than ever in history.   \nBut when Mann traveled to Portugal to report on that country's model for dealing with the opioid crisis, he heard a very different story. Overdose deaths in Portugal are extremely rare.\nThe country has taken a radically different approach to drugs – decriminalizing small amounts and publicly funding addiction services – including sites where people can use drugs like crack and heroin. \nPortugal treats addiction as an illness rather than a crime. No one has to pay for addiction care, and no one scrambles to navigate a poorly regulated recovery system. Could Portugal's approach help the U-S fight its opioid epidemic?\nFor sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.  \nEmail us at considerthis@npr.org.",

But the finger-pointing has already begun. \nThe rush to punishment comes amid the grief, but also the mounting fury and frustration over the Turkish government’s earthquake response.

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Tuesday, saying at a Fox News town hall that he might cut ties with the minority leader upon regaining the White House. \n“He’ll probably end up endorsing me. I don’t know that I can work with him,” Trump said, as NBC News reports. “He gave away trillions of dollars that he didn’t have to, trillions of dollars. He made it very easy for the Democrats.”\n\nThe Republican bigs' bromance soured after McConnell drew a line after Jan. 6, 2021 when hordes of Trump sympathizers stormed the Capitol to thwart the certification of the presidential election to then President-Elect Joe Biden.  \nMcConnell likened Trump’s role in the fiasco as a “disgraceful dereliction of duty” when he, along with 42 other Republicans voted \"not guilty\" when he was charged of incitement of insurrection.\nREAD MORE: Inside the neo-Nazi hate network grooming children for a race war\n\"There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. No question about it,\" McConnell said at the time. \"The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.\"\nThe Republican senator added, \"And having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet earth.\"\nMcConnell has yet to endorse Trump's third White House bid. \n\nIt's unclear if McConnell will even seek another term in office, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-TX). \n“That’s a decision for Mitch to make,\" Cruz said. \"Obviously, there’s a lot of bad blood between Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. Mitch will have to make that decision. What I want to see is I want to see Republicans in the Senate stand and lead and fight.\"",

          "description": "Chile will once again try to resolve the mystery of what really killed the Nobel laureate poet Pablo Neruda, who many believe was poisoned by the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a court said Tuesday.\nThe appeals court ordered the reopening of the investigation into the death of Neruda, who was a prominent member of Chile's Communist Party when military dictator Augusto Pinochet took power in 1973.\nIn a statement, the court said that the \"investigation has not been exhausted as there are precise procedures that can be carried out to clarify the facts.\"\nNeruda had been preparing to flee into exile in Mexico to lead the resistance against the Pinochet regime when he died in hospital just 12 days after the coup.\nThe government claimed the 69-year-old had died of prostate cancer.\nAn investigation into the cause of Neruda's death began in 2011 when Manuel Araya -- his driver and personal assistant -- asserted that the poet was given a mysterious injection in his chest just before he died.\nAraya died in June last year, aged 77.\nIn 2017, a group of Chilean and international experts concluded that Neruda did not die of cancer, but said they could not determine what did kill him.\nAnd in 2023, a scientific panel investigating Neruda's death was also unable to determine whether he had been poisoned, even though they detected dangerous botulism-causing bacteria in his system.\nJudge Paola Plaza ordered the probe to be closed in December 2023, but Neruda's family and the Communist Party appealed that decision soon after.\nNeruda is remembered especially for sensual poems about love.\nHowever, in recent years his romantic image has been tainted after his admission in his posthumous memoirs that he had raped a woman came to light after the emergence of the #MeToo movement.\nPinochet, who ruled Chile for 17 years, oversaw a regime that killed some 3,200 leftist activists and other suspected opponents.\nThe dictator died in 2006 aged 91 without ever being convicted for crimes committed by his regime.\n© 2024 AFP",

He earned admiration from Russia's disparate opposition for voluntarily returning to Russia the following year.\nHis death comes just a day before the official launch of campaigning ahead of a new round of presidential elections set for March 15-17.\nPutin oversaw changes to the constitution in 2021 that will allow him to run for two more six-year terms, meaning he could stay in power until 2036. Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.\nOn December 8 Putin announced his candidature for re-election and is widely expected to win, given the lack of political alternatives and the Kremlin's iron grip on the state apparatus.\nWith AFP.",
