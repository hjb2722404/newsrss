The summit aims to bring together Arab and European heads of state to discuss the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the future of the Palestinian issue. However, there is uncertainty about who will attend, with no confirmation from the US, China, or Russia. Arab countries have expressed anger at Israel's actions in Gaza.",

The provisions are intended to bring some relief to the Palestinians in Gaza, which is being blockaded by Israel in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on towns in southern Israel. \n\nMany in Gaza, reduced to eating one meal a day and without enough water to drink, are waiting desperately for the aid. It was unclear whether fuel would be allowed across to power hospital generators. \n\nOn Friday, workers began repairing damaged to the crossing caused by Israeli bombings. Officials hoped to open the crossing on Saturday.",

The unconventional policy was first proposed by MIT physicist Thomas Neff in a 1991 New York Times op-ed. By the time Megatons to Megawatts ran its full course from 1993 to 2013, it had eliminated about 20,000 nuclear warheads and stood out as a point of shared pride in the often jaded arms control and disarmament field. “Nearly every commercia…",

          "description": "French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne avoided parliamentary censure in an early morning vote on Saturday after she forced the government's budget plan through the National Assembly without a vote. \nThe motion to censure Borne – the 18th levelled at her since she assumed the office – was brought by the left-wing Nupes alliance after the prime minister activated Article 49.3 to adopt the public finance bill without a vote.\nThe motion received just 193 of the 289 votes needed to succeed, an unsurprising outcome in light of the lack of support from the centre-right.\nIts rejection constitutes the adoption of the 2023-2027 budget program, which now moves to the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament.\nThe speaker for Nupes, socialist Philippe Brun, accused the government of \"favouring with the greatest servility a very well-endowed minority of the French\" despite \"an immense inflationary crisis\".\nPresident Emmanuel Macron had \"tried to make parliament disappear with his repeated (use of) 49.3\", Brun added.\nThe far right had supported the left's motion of censure, accusing Borne of the \"repeated and abusive use of 49.3\".\nBorne, for her part, hit back at both factions, saying \"demagoguery is your only budgetary course\".\nThe government also resorted to Article 49.3 earlier this year to push through unpopular pension reforms, sparking violent protests.\n(AFP)",

She was also the team's long-time head coach.\nShe had denied claims of psychological abuse, saying the accusations came from disgruntled gymnasts who were not selected for Olympic squads.\nParents of gymnasts training at the national centre in Desio wrote a letter to the head of Italy's Olympic Committee in support of the 57-year-old, who has won a raft of medals for Italy since taking charge in 1996.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Six female migrants trapped inside a refrigerated food truck were rescued by French police after one of the women made a distress call to a reporter, the BBC and French authorities said Thursday.\nThe women — four Vietnamese and two Iraqis — hid for hours in a truck loaded with boxes of bananas in northern France, believing the vehicle was on its way to the U.K. or Ireland.\nWhen they realized that the truck was going the opposite way, they started to panic in the cold and cramped, dark space. One of them managed to reach a BBC reporter in London, who then helped the women alert French police Wednesday.\nFrench prosecutor Laetitia Francart said the truck driver, who was in fact heading for Italy, was not at fault. The women told investigators that the driver wasn’t involved, “saying that they…",

          "description": "Twin shootings in Rotterdam on Thursday have resulted in an unknown number of fatalities, police said.\nA gunman dressed in combat gear opened fire in a flat in the Dutch city then burst into a nearby medical centre. Fires broke out in both places but were later extinguished.\n“The two shooting incidents in Rotterdam have resulted in fatalities. We will first inform family and relatives and will explain more later,” the city police said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\nElite police units had burst into the hospital in the Dutch city searching for the suspect, who was armed with a handgun, authorities said.\nThe suspect is 32 and the motive for the attack is unknown, local news agency ANP said, citing police. He is suspected of carrying out both shootings and there is not a second shooter, police said.\nPictures from the scene showed people streaming out of the hospital, including medics and patients, as police in body armour moved in. Police helicopters buzzed overhead.\nMedics in white coats wheeled patients out on stretchers and wheelchairs\nPolice had earlier said the suspect was wearing “combat-style” clothes, was tall, with black hair and carrying a backpack.\n“First there was a shooting on the fourth floor. Four or five shots were fired. Then a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the education centre,” said a medical student cited by RTL Nieuws, who did not give his name.\n“There was a lot of panic and screaming... I didn’t hear any shots, just the panic and that’s what I started to act on,” public broadcaster NOS cited another eyewitness as saying.\nRotterdam is often the scene of shootings, usually attributed to score settling by rival drug gangs.\nAuthorities were expected to hold a news conference shortly to give more details.\nIn 2019, three people were shot dead on a tram in Utrecht, sparking a huge manhunt.\nAnd in 2011, the country was left shocked when 24-year Tristan van der Vlis killed six people and wounded 10 others in a rampage at a packed shopping mall.\n(AFP)",

He was 82.\nA statement by his family, issued by his publicist, said he died following “a bout of pneumonia.”\n“We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside,” his family said.\nNo matter what role he took on in a career that lasted more than five decades, Gambon was always instantly recognizable by the deep and drawling tones of his voice. He was cast as the much-loved Dumbledore after the death of his predecessor, Richard Harris, in 2002.\nHe once acknowledged not having read a…",
