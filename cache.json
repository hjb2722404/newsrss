He was 78 years old.\nThe cause was multiple health issues, her daughter Silvie Jensen said.\nGood American Pinot Noir was rarely seen in 1972, when Mr. Jensen, in love with French Burgundy, the source of the world’s great Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays, set out to produce his own version in California.  With few exceptions, most American Pinot Noirs of the time were straightforward and fruity at best;  more often than not, these were hot central valley stews.\nBut Mr. Jensen h…",

          "description": "Don Perkins, a six-time Pro Bowl running back with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960s, died Thursday.  He was 84 years old.\nThe Cowboys and the University of New Mexico, where Perkins was a standout player before his professional career, announced the death.  No announcement said where he died, and none cited the cause.\nPerkins rushed for 6,217 yards in 107 games with the Cowboys from 1961 to 1968. He is fourth on the team’s career list behind two Pro Football Hall of Famers – Emmitt Smith, the career leader of the NFL, and Tony Dorsett – and the current Cowboys.  running back, Ezekiel Elliott.  Perkins’ 42 rushing touchdowns rank fifth in team history.\n\n\nWhile originally drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the ninth round of the 1960 draft, Perkins had already signed a personal services contract with the expansion Cowboys.  Dallas won its rights after sending the Colts a ninth-round draft pick.\n\n\nPerkins missed the Cowboys’ inaugural season in 1960 with a broken foot.  He ran for 815 yards in 1961 and finished third in voting for NFL Rookie of the Year, behind Mike Ditka and Fran Tarkenton.  He had a career-high 945 rushing yards in 1962.\n\n\nDonald Anthony Perkins was born on March 4, 1938 in Waterloo, Iowa.  He played for New Mexico from 1957 to 1959 and captained the team in its final two seasons.  The Lobos’ coach at the time, future Hall of Famer Marv Levy, said Perkins was one of the greatest players he ever coached.\nPerkins returned to the Albuquerque area after his professional football career ended.  He then worked as a television and radio football analyst.\n\n\nInformation about survivors was not immediately available.\n“Don is one of the greatest Lobos, and certainly one of the greatest football players to play for UNM,” New Mexico athletic director Eddie Nuñez said.  “He came back to New Mexico and worked for the state and was a tremendous ambassador for so many people.”\n\nSource Link",

It is typical for Russian courts to prolong detention several times until trial.  Ms Griner’s lawyer, Aleksandr Boikov, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe American basketball star was arrested four months ago after Russian officials said they found vape cartridges containing traces of hash oil in her luggage as she walked through Sheremetyevo airport, the Moscow’s main international airport.  The charge carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.\n\n\nMs Griner was arrested on February 17, a week before Russia invaded Ukraine, but authorities did not reveal she was detained until days after the war began, raising fears that not be used as a bargaining chip in the global crisis.  There has been speculation that once convicted, Ms Griner could be part of a prisoner swap with the United States.\n\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Ms. Griner plays for the Phoenix Mercury and US officials meet with the team on Monday to discuss efforts to secure his release.  In May, the State Department said it determined Ms Griner had been “wrongfully detained.”\nWhen taken into custody, Ms Griner was returning to Russia to perform for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team.  Many WNBA players supplement their income the league’s off-season playing internationally.\n\nSource Link",

Stanley/U.S. Navy via AP   \nInsider: The US Navy's plan to ditch its cruisers will leave it out of a small and well-armed club \n* The US Navy is trying to retire all of its guided-missile cruisers by 2027. \n* US cruisers are specialized for air defense and are among the best-armed naval ships in service. \n* Lawmakers are dismayed by the Navy plan, believing it will reduce US firepower as China's navy grows.\nIn April, the US Navy presented an ambitious plan to decommission all 22 of its Ticonderoga-class cruisers by 2027.  The move is not surprising. \nThe Navy has tried to rid itself of its cruisers for years, but Congress has consistently rejected its proposals, largely out of concern that decommissioning them would take away a much-needed weapon as China's naval force continues to grow. \nWith the retirement of the last battleships nearly 20 years ago, cruisers are the largest surface combatants — a category that generally doesn't include aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships — in service.   \nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Concerns on where the US Navy is going are rising ....
