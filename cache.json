Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Friday likened Donald Trump’s plight to that of disgraced Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro.\nThe far-right congresswoman suggested that special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump is politically motivated, but she did the former president no favors comparing him to Bolsonaro.\nShe isn’t the first to make the comparison. \nBoth leaders are election deniers who inspired failed insurrections after spreading baseless theories of voter fraud. \nBolsonaro was found guilty of abusing his power and misusing public media during last year’s election, and Brazil’s highest electoral court on Friday issued a ruling that bars him for running for public office until 2030.\nBrazilian prosecutors alleged that Bolsonaro in July 2022 held a meeting with foreign ambassador in which he spread misinformation about Brazil’s electoral system. \nTrump is facing a 37-count indictment over allegations he mishandled classified documents. \n“That's EXACTLY what the American liberals are trying to do through the court system here,” Boebert tweeted.\n“Unbelievable how liberals use lawfare since they can't win fairly.”",

This comes after a review of the EU's 2021-27 shared budget, which has been depleted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and an energy crisis. High inflation and interest rates have also doubled debt-servicing costs. \n\"One thing is clear, we Hungarians ... will not give more money to Ukraine until they say where the previous around 70 billion euros worth of funds had gone,\" Orban said.\n\n \nRead more ....\n\n \nUpdate: Ukraine must explain how €70 billion was spent – EU state (RT)\n\n \nWNU Editor: Here is an easy prediction.

A spokesperson for NATO didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe move to retain Stoltenberg was widely rumored and expected ahead of a major NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania next month, billed as one of the most important alliance gatherings in years amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\n \nRead more .... \nNATO Members Agree To Extend Secretary-General Stoltenberg’s Tenure For Another Year\n\n \nNATO members have tentative agreement to extend Secretary-General Stoltenberg’s tenure another year -- AP \nNATO Agrees To Extend Stoltenberg Mandate: Diplomats -- AFP\n\"Captain in the storm\": Stoltenberg to remain NATO Secretary General for another year – Euractiv -- Ukrainska Pravda",
