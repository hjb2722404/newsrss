This continent will bring extreme temperatures, rendering it uninhabitable for mammals. The study attributes the dramatic increase in temperatures to heightened volcanism and the sun emitting more energy and heat as it ages. The research provides insights into how Earth's climate might change in the distant future due to natural processes. Despite concerns about contemporary climate change, the Earth is expected to remain habitable until the emergence of Pangea Ultima.",

Likening the plight of Israelis to the American population after 9/11, he said the savage attack on civilians by Hamas is even worse than what happened in the Yom Kippur War of exactly 50 years ago, during which he himself was injured. Gitai is however highly critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he calls for \"peaceful solutions\" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",

Highlighting the appalling dilemma facing the whole country, other relatives warn mediation could take years and say their best hope lies with the military, hoping ground forces could find the missing men, women and children before it is too late.

          "description": "A secret recording revealed by \"60 Minutes Australia\" exposed a conversation former President Donald Trump had with billionaire Anthony Pratt while he was in office, The New York Times reported. \nPratt is the businessman whom the ex-president told classified secrets that are of the highest possible security level. Another thing Trump revealed is a detail from the call he had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment. \nAmong the notes of the call, Trump told Zelensky that he would release the military equipment already allocated by Congress if and only if he did a \"favor\" for him. \n\n\nDeclassified text of Trump's Ukraine call notes\n\n            Photo: Scren capture\n        \n\n\n\nTrump bragged to Pratt: “That was nothing compared to what I usually do,\" admitting not only to the bribery but also that it's frequent behavior for him. \n\n\"It is not clear whether Mr. Pratt shared these accounts with prosecutors or whether prosecutors are aware of the recordings,\" The Times reported. \nAnother thing included in the report is that Trump asked his wife Melania to strut about Mar-a-Lago in a bikini. Another revelation is that behind closed doors Pratt was trashing Trump, even while he was still in office. \nSenate Republicans ultimately refused to hear beyond the opening statements of the Trump impeachment, voting to acquit him of the charges. \nRead the full report here.",

But No 10 is eager to dispel suggestions that there will be celebrations of any kind as he faces entrenched unease among Tories, a stuttering economy and crises abroad. Mr Sunak may have steadied the ship after his predecessor’s chaotic 49-day spell as prime minister, but he remains lagging a distant second behind Labour in the polls.",
