          "description": "[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]\r \r Researchers at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) have identified and demonstrated for the first time a therapeutic small molecule, M1, that can restore the visual function in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), offering hope for patients with optic nerve damage such as glaucoma-related vision loss.\r \r Traumatic injuries to the CNS, including the optic nerve, the brain and the spinal cord, are the leading causes of disability worldwide for which there is no available treatment. M1 stimulates the fusion and motility of mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell to generate energy) and induces robust axon regeneration by enhancing the intrinsic growth capacity of injured neurons.\r \r Led by Dr Eddie Ma Chi-him, Associate Head and Associate Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Director of the Laboratory Animal Research Unit at CityU, this research breakthrough heralds a new approach that could address unmet medical needs in accelerating functional recovery within a limited therapeutic time window after CNS injuries.\r \r “Photoreceptors in the eyes [retina] forward visual information to neurons in the retina. To facilitate the recovery of visual function after injury, axons of neurons must regenerate through the optic nerve and relay nerve impulses to visual targets in the brain via the optic nerve for image processing and formation,” said Dr Ma.\r \r \r \r “M1 treatment sustains long-distance axon regeneration from the optic chiasm, i.e. midway between the eyes and target brain region, to multiple subcortical visual targets in the brain. Regenerated axons elicit neural activities in target brain regions and restore visual functions after M1 treatment. Our study highlights the potential of a readily available and non-viral therapy for CNS repair.”\r \r The seven-year-long study builds on the team’s previous research on peripheral nerve regeneration using gene therapy.\r \r “This time we have used the small molecule M1 for repairing…",

Our reporter Gwendoline Debono went to meet resistants in the southern Kherson region, which was retaken from Russian forces last November. The clandestine actions of these ordinary citizens played a key role in the liberation of Kherson. Driven only by their conscience, these Ukrainian men and women managed to thwart the Kremlin's plans to annex their region to Russia. Behind Russian lines, Gwendoline Debono was also able to gain access to a Ukrainian military unit responsible for conducting military operations in enemy territory.",

All too often, when people think about sexual violence, they assume the acts are committed against women. But men – both soldiers and civilians – are also victims. Our reporters Luke Shrago and Mélina Huet followed prosecutors on the ground in Ukraine as they went about their harrowing work, building cases to be prosecuted, with the hope of one day seeing an international trial take place.",

Whole cities have been destroyed and millions of Ukrainians are now refugees.

She also officiated at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.\n© 2023 AFP",

I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!\"\nThe queen's death also forced a reckoning for Welsh actor Michael Sheen, who handed back his OBE late last year and urged an end to the heir to the British crown being named prince of Wales.\nFurther back, Beatles songwriter John Lennon returned his MBE medal -- which ranks below an OBE -- in 1969 in protest at UK involvement in a Nigerian civil war and its support for the US war in Vietnam.\n© 2023 AFP",

          "description": "Embattled Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday urged Congress to advance elections slated for April 2024 to December 2023 as protests against her leadership that have left dozens dead continue.\nPeru has been embroiled in a political crisis with near-daily protests since December 7 when former president Pedro Castillo was arrested after attempting to dissolve parliament and rule by decree.\nHis supporters are demanding that Boluarte resign and call fresh elections.\nBoluarte said she had asked her Cabinet to support the bill before it is taken up by Congress.\n\"We put this bill to advance elections to December 2023 to the ministers for consideration,\" said Boluarte during a ceremony at a military airport in Lima.\nCongress previously voted on December 21 in favor of a Boluarte bill to bring forward elections from 2026 to 2024.\n\"Congress voted once and we are waiting for them to vote again. However, the protests continue. There are more roadblocks and violence,\" added Boluarte, describing the current political crisis as a \"quagmire.\"\nBut protesters are demanding immediate elections, as well as Boluarte's removal, the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution.\nIn seven weeks of protests since Castillo's arrest, at least 46 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.\nSome of the worst violence and highest death tolls have come when protesters tried to storm airports in the country's south.\nThose southern regions with large indigenous populations have been the epicenter of the protest movement that has affected Peru's vital tourism industry.\nAs well as blocking dozens of roads and forcing the temporary closure of several airports, protesters have placed rocks on the train tracks that act as the only transport access to Machu Picchu, the former Inca citadel and jewel of Peruvian tourism.\nThat resulted in hundreds of tourists being left stranded at the archeological ruins and many of them were evacuated by helicopter.\n(AFP)",

          "description": "“Who is Mr. Putin?” This question, first posed in 1999, remains unanswered. Married? Children? Even basic information on Russia’s president is a state secret. Kremlin propaganda trumpets Vladimir’s humble origins, but offers meager details. For example, on October 27, 2022, Putin claimed his working class background allowed him to “delicately feel the pulse of common people.” \nI question this legend by asserting that Putin benefited from a familial connection to a prominent member of the Soviet elite, Mikhail Eliseevich Putin (1894–1969). Mikhail helped establish “socialist competition,” a crucial institution for Stalinist modernization whereby workers were encouraged to contend for social recognition instead of wages. Once a “name familiar to all Soviets,” Mikhail Putin is a forgotten fig…",
