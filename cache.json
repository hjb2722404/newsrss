          "description": "Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had 40 soldiers removed from the detail at his presidential residence after vowing a staffing cleanup following anti-government riots on January 8.\nJust days after the attack on the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress by backers of far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said the rioters likely had inside help.\nHe ordered a thorough staffing review, saying he was \"convinced that the door of the Planalto (presidential) palace was opened for people to enter because there are no broken doors.\"\nIn a notice published in the official gazette Tuesday, it was announced that 40 soldiers have been removed from the presidential detail at Alvorada palace, where Brazil's presidents live.\nLeftist Lula beat Bolsonaro by a razor-thin margin in October elections that followed a vitriolic and divisive campaign.\nAs he marked a week in office, thousands broke into the seats of power on January 8, smashing furniture, damaging priceless works of art and leaving behind graffiti messages calling for a military coup against Lula.\n>> Read more: Brazil riots raise questions of efficiency and loyalty of security forces\nThe president said last week that any \"radical bolsonarista\" found still working for the government would be dealt with, and cited media reports of alleged threats made by staffers inherited from the previous administration.\n\"How can I have a person outside my office who might shoot me?\" asked Lula, who said members of the security services may have been involved in the uprising.\nBolsonaro, who left Brazil two days before Lula's inauguration and is in the United States, is being investigated on suspicion of instigating the uprising.\nHe has denied any link to the riots.\nIn a video published Monday, Bolsonaro expressed \"regret\" over the events, which he described as \"unbelievable\".\n(AFP)",

China’s Mysterious ‘Stealth Fighter’ Spotted On Screen That Looks Quite Similar To US 6th-Gen Design \nOnce again, a very interesting image that points towards China developing a fixed-wing, sixth-generation fighter jet has gone viral on social media. \nEarlier this week, a mysterious stealth fighter was spotted on the computer screen at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). \nThe photo was taken by an anonymous user and initially posted to the Chinese micro-blogging website Weibo with little to no additional details. \nFrom the look, the fighter-sized aircraft concept appears to be a tailless, twin-engine, flying wing design similar to the sixth-generation fighter concepts like the American NGAD or the British Tempest sixth-generation fighter jet. \nEven though the photo’s veracity could not be independently established, it is in line with the assumption and the evidence that suggests China is indeed focusing on a tailless configuration for its sixth-generation fighter jet.   \nRead more ....   \nUpdate: China’s 6th generation fighter concept appears in AVIC simulator (Air Data News)   \nWNU Editor: China did unveil their 6th generation fighter jet concept 2 months ago ....

Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/Reuters \nThe Guardian: German tank manufacturer’s warning puts pressure on Ukraine’s allies  \nDefence firm dampens Kyiv hopes other European allies will follow UK’s lead in supplying heavy armour \nBattle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will not be ready to be delivered until 2024, the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has warned, increasing pressure on Nato allies to support Ukraine with armoured vehicles in active service instead, ahead of a key meeting this week. \n“Even if the decision to send our Leopard tanks to Kyiv came tomorrow, the delivery would take until the start of next year,” Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. \nRheinmetall, which manufactures the battle vehicle’s gun, has 22 Leopard 2 and 88 older Leopard 1 tanks in its stocks. Getting the Leopard tanks ready for battle, however, would take several months and cost hundreds of millions of euros the company could not put up until the order was confirmed, Papperger said.  \n\nRead more ....   \nWNU Editor: Ukraine needs hundreds of combat tanks and the infrastructure/ammo/fuel to back such a force.
